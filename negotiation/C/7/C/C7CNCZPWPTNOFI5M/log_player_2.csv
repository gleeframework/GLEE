"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice.  There's a good chance she'll be willing to come down in price, especially if she values the product at less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but it's a good starting point for negotiation. If Alice rejects this offer, I can continue to counter-offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm willing to take the risk of another round of negotiation, hoping to get closer to my target price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to go even lower, especially since she's already made a concession."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown some willingness to negotiate, moving down from $1,500,000 to $1,350,000.  I'm raising my offer to $1,150,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer but still leaves room for compromise. This counteroffer demonstrates my serious interest in buying the product while staying within a range I'm comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but she's clearly moving in the right direction. I'm willing to try one more round of negotiation to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a pattern of reducing her price by about $125,000 each time. I'm increasing my offer by a similar amount to $1,175,000. This hopefully will be a sweet spot where we can both agree on a price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to lower her price, it's still $200,000 above my maximum budget. At this point, I'm concerned that the negotiation is getting too drawn out and I'm risking losing the product to another buyer if I keep rejecting offers. I'm confident that I can get the product from John for a price I'm comfortable with, so I'm going to go with the guaranteed deal and buy from John."
