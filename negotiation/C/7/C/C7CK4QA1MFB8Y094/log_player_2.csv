"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $120, but Alice is asking for $100. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **The goal is to save money:**  By rejecting the offer, you can try to get a better price.
* **There are multiple rounds:**  You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so you can afford to reject the first offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
