"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your valuation of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable agreement. Based on my research and understanding of the market, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's unique value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. This seems to be a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. There's no benefit to further negotiation or taking John's offer, as they're both the same amount."
