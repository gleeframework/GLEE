"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be a great fit for you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum and saves you money compared to buying from John."
