"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd be interested in.  I'm asking $11,500 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's potential for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for the product. This is still a fair price, considering the value it holds for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still room for negotiation. Alice has shown a willingness to come down, and Bob can leverage that to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $11,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, but $10,750 is still a bit too low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,875. This price allows me to make a profit while still being within your budget.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,875. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,875
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Current Price:** $10,875
* **Bob's Max:** $12,000
* **Alice's Minimum:** $10,000

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and it's still within Bob's budget.  While there's a chance to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may not budge again or that the deal will fall apart.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to acquire the product at a reasonable price within the remaining rounds."
