"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm confident in the value this product holds for you, and I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we settle at $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both benefit from this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
