"Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would ensure a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a final agreement.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I can work with. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for your product. That's a solid offer, and it's only a little more than what I'd pay John. Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
