"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($1,000,000) and slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This allows room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive and friendly tone sets the stage for a productive negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I emphasize the value of the product to Bob to incentivize him to consider the deal.

**Note:**  I'm aware that this might be a high starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate down if necessary. I'll also be monitoring Bob's response carefully to decide if I should move to John or continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for your product.  It's a fair price, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to $1,000,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price and still within a range that Bob might be willing to consider. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, but I'm aiming for a higher profit.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll be careful to keep the negotiations positive and focus on the value proposition of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, but I'm staying firm at my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm again reminding Bob of the product's value and how the price is still a good deal for him.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and open to further negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I'm closely watching Bob's response. If he rejects this offer, I'll need to carefully assess whether to continue negotiations or switch to John to secure a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. However, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for a slight compromise. I can counter with a price slightly lower than my minimum,  keeping the negotiation moving forward.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, I'm not ready to give up on getting a slightly better price from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price slightly below $1,000,000,  perhaps $950,000. I'll try to strike a balance between my profit and finding common ground with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is closer to what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This would ensure a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  My counteroffer shows a willingness to meet Bob halfway, but it's still above his last offer, suggesting a desire for a slightly higher profit.
* **Final Agreement:**  I'm framing this offer as a potential ""final agreement"" to encourage Bob to seriously consider it.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to keep the negotiation friendly.

**Next Steps:**

I'm prepared to potentially accept Bob's offer if he counters again with something close to $950,000.  However, if he drops his offer significantly, I might consider selling to John for $1,000,000 to secure a guaranteed profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to a price I can work with. I'm willing to pay $925,000 for your product. That's a solid offer, and it's only a little more than what I'd pay John. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is only $25,000 away from my desired price of $950,000.  This is a good compromise considering the limited rounds remaining.
* **Risk of Losing Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or further reduce his offer. This could lead to a lower sale price or even a failure to sell the product.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $1,000,000 is tempting, accepting Bob's offer will still result in a significant profit.

**Next Steps:**

I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and close the deal. It's a good price, and it secures a profitable sale."
