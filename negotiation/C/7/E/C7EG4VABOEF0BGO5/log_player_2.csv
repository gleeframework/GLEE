"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for a price of $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but it's still above your target price of saving as much as possible. You can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely tempting, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount, but I'm still not willing to let it go for that price. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $875,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your desired price.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John for $1,000,000 is too high.  Accepting her offer at $875,000 is a good compromise and saves you $125,000."
