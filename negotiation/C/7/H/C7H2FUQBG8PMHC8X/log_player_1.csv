{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,000 is more than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob might be willing to pay closer to $12,000, giving you room to negotiate upwards.
* **It's a strong first offer:** Showing that you're confident in the value of your product and not afraid to ask for a good price."
