{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential compromise. It also emphasizes the value of the product to create a positive impression."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget concerns.  How about we split the difference?  I'd be willing to let it go for $135.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is too low for me. While I could continue negotiating, it seems unlikely I'll get a price closer to my minimum.  To ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $150."
