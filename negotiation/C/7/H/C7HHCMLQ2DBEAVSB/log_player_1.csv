Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $11,500. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you, and this is a very competitive price."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible (her guaranteed sale price with John).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's perceived value ($8,000) allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still landing Alice a good deal.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""competitive price"" might subtly suggest to Bob that others are interested, prompting him to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** While Alice has a guaranteed sale with John, there's no guarantee John will remain willing to buy at $12,000 indefinitely. It's in Alice's best interest to secure a deal with Bob if possible, even if it means accepting a slightly lower price."
