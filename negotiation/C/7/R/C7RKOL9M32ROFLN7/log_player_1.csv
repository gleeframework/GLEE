Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. It's incredibly valuable, and I know you'll appreciate its potential.  I'm willing to make a deal at $900,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have significant interest from another buyer."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, aiming higher with Bob allows you to potentially earn an extra $100,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $900,000 is a tempting price for Bob. It's significantly less than your minimum and still a considerable profit above his perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly."
