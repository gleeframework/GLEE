"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to acquire this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and yield significant returns for you."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  I begin with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This sets a high anchor, potentially influencing Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""immense potential"" and ability to ""yield significant returns."" This framing aims to justify the high price and shift focus towards value rather than just the upfront cost.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial high offer provides ample room for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my starting point and significantly above Bob's perceived value.  I believe there's room for negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $2,000,000. Selling to John at this point would be a significant loss compared to what I could potentially get from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move closer to your price, but $1,800,000 is still below what I consider a fair valuation. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a beneficial outcome."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Justification:** I acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and show flexibility by reducing my asking price. However, I frame it as ""meeting halfway,"" reinforcing the idea that my initial offer wasn't arbitrary.
* **Emphasize Value:** I continue to emphasize the product's ""true worth"" to subtly shift focus away from just the price and towards the perceived value. 
* **Targeting a Favorable Range:** I'm aiming to settle around $2,000,000.  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while staying within a potentially acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now quite close to my target price of $2,000,000. While I might be able to push for a bit more, the difference is becoming less significant. Accepting at $1,900,000 secures a very good deal, well above both my minimum and Bob's initial offer. It's better to take this profit now than risk Bob lowering his offer further or walking away entirely."
