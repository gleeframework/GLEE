"I appreciate your enthusiasm, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $2,300,000. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to move closer to your price, but $1,800,000 is still below what I consider a fair valuation. Would you consider meeting me halfway at $2,050,000? This reflects the product's true worth and leaves us both with a beneficial outcome.",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
