"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, considering the value it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum acceptable value, hoping to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $95 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm going to try and push for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to secure a deal closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. It's a fair price considering the product's value. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I still feel that $95 would be a fair price for your product. I am willing to pay $95 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob is willing to pay $95, which is close to my minimum acceptable value, I'm concerned that further negotiation might not lead to a significantly better price. To avoid risking further rounds of negotiation and potential deadlock, I'll sell the product to John for $100, ensuring a guaranteed profit."
