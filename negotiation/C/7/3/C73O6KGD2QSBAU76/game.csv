"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to start the conversation at $1200000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential of this product, the initial price is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it. This is my best offer, considering my maximum budget is $800000 and I'd like to leave room for some negotiation. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $850000 is your maximum budget, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than that. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $950000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $950000 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step for me, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,920000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think the product's value is worth more than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $950000, so I'll make a new offer of $925000. This is my best compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,,
