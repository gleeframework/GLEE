,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
