"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to Bob, so accepting Alice's offer of $950,000 is not a good option.  Buying from John for $800,000 is also not the best choice at this point, as there's a chance Bob can get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $700,000. This is a bold move, but it sets a strong negotiating position and gives Alice room to counter without feeling like she's losing too much.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Alice's offer of $850,000 is closer to Bob's limit, it's still above his target. It's worth continuing to negotiate.  There's a chance Alice may be willing to come down further, and Bob still has more rounds to try and get a better deal.  Buying from John at this point would mean paying more than necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm increasing my offer to $750,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product while staying within my budget. It also creates a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, making it more likely she will accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to Bob's limit, but he can still try for a better price.  Buying from John for $800,000 is an option, but it's not ideal with only a few rounds left.  By rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate, Bob has a chance to get the product for closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

Bob is now offering his maximum price of $800,000. This is a final attempt to secure the product within his budget and avoid going to John.  If Alice rejects this offer, Bob will likely need to buy from John in the next round."
