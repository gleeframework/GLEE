{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you and still allows me a good profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price that is closer to my desired profit margin.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me at this point, but I'm open to making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a significant discount from the product's value to you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $9,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway from your original offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $9,800 is a reasonable compromise, and it's still a good deal for me.  It's also possible that Bob won't budge further, and I risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to accept his offer than risk losing him and having to sell to John for a lower price."
