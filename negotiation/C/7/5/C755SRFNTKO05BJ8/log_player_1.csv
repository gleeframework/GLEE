Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum value, leaving room for negotiation. It's important to be friendly and open to discussion to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can agree to a price of $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum value, and continuing to negotiate could risk losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
