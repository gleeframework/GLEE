Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I'm anticipating, I'm offering it to you for $20,000."", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, there's a chance Bob might be willing to pay more. Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation.
* **Anchoring Bias:** By starting at $20,000, you anchor Bob's perception of the product's value higher than his perceived $8,000.  
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob rejects the initial offer, the door is open for counter-offers. You can gradually lower the price, but never below your minimum of $15,000.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's financial situation or negotiation style beyond his valuation of the product."
