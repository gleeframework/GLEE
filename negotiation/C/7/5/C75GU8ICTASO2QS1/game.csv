"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a compromise for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand this is your final offer, I think we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $980,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product.",980000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence and willingness to invest in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,7,
