"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
Alice's starting price is significantly above her value. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit high.  Would you consider $900,000?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This offer is significantly below Alice's asking price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It allows us to gauge her willingness to move from her initial position. 
* **Aiming for a Good Deal:**  We want to buy the product for significantly less than our $1,200,000 walk-away point, and ideally closer to Alice's $1,000,000 value.
* **Early Stage:**  It's early in the negotiation. A strong counter-offer sets the stage for potentially securing a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met us halfway from her initial offer, the price is still significantly above her $1,000,000 value. There's room to negotiate further.
* **Strategic Concessions:** We need to show Alice we're willing to move from our initial offer but not concede too much too quickly. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so there's no pressure to accept a price we're not comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about $950,000? I think that's a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 950000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increases:** We're increasing our offer, demonstrating our willingness to compromise, but in smaller increments to signal we're not willing to drastically overpay.
* **Targeting a Midpoint:** We're aiming for a price somewhere between our last offer and Alice's counter-offer, hoping to find a mutually agreeable middle ground.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not jumping too high, we retain bargaining power and keep the negotiation moving towards a price that works for us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $950,000 is a bit of a compromise for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll love the product at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice stating this is her final offer is likely a negotiation tactic to pressure us into accepting. It's important not to fold immediately, even if it might be her actual limit.
* **Still Above Value:** $1,025,000 is still a significant markup from her $1,000,000 value. We can push for a better deal.
* **Calculated Risk:** We're getting close to a price we'd consider, but there are still rounds left for negotiation.  We'll take a calculated risk and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand this is your final offer, I think we can still find a price that works for both of us.  Would you consider $980,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 980000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging the ""Final Offer"":**  We don't want to completely ignore Alice's statement, but we also don't want it to stop us from negotiating further.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  We're proposing a price nearly halfway between our last offer and her ""final"" offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for our offer, such as a limited budget or emphasizing the product's value, can make it more persuasive. 
* **Strategic Timing:** We're getting closer to our limit, but we still have rounds left.  A strong counter-offer at this stage could lead to a favorable outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence and willingness to invest in the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering $1,075,000. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Unfavorable Trend:** Alice has increased her offer from her previous ""final offer"". This suggests she may be less willing to negotiate down further and could even be trying to push us closer to our limit. 
* **Limited Time:**  We only have a few rounds left, and continuing negotiations with Alice might not yield a significantly better price.  
* **Safe Alternative:**  We have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $1,200,000. While not ideal, it's better than potentially ending up with an even higher price from Alice if the negotiation continues to move against us."
