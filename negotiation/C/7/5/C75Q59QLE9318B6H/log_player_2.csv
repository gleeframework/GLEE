"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, as I know it will be valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $110 is lower than your maximum price, you can try to get a better deal. Alice is clearly motivated to sell.  Rejecting her offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her $80 value."
