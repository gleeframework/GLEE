{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $115. This is higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120, giving me some wiggle room.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the potential benefit for Bob.  I'm not stating my minimum price outright to avoid limiting his willingness to negotiate. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while ensuring a sale. By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I encourage him to negotiate. If he rejects my offer, I'll be prepared to counter with a lower price, but I'll also have the option to sell to John if negotiations stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay that price for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, I believe I can still get a better price.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a fair price. I will counter with a price that's more appealing to me, while still leaving room for negotiation. If negotiations fail, I have the option to sell to John for $120, guaranteeing a decent profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $105, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $115 and Bob's offer of $90. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum price.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and reiterating the value proposition for Bob. I'm also highlighting the fairness of the price from my perspective. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us. By offering a compromise, I'm hoping to encourage Bob to accept the offer. If he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I'll also keep the option of selling to John in mind if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $102.50. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $102.5 is still lower than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  Furthermore, continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, leaving me with only the option to sell to John. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid further negotiation.  The profit margin might be smaller than I initially hoped for, but it's still a decent outcome considering the circumstances."
