"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob, or from another buyer if this negotiation doesn't work out."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would have preferred a higher price, $1,000,000 is a good deal, and I'm confident I won't get a better offer from him. It's also better than selling to John for $800,000."
