"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,250,000 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. I could go as high as $1,150,000. Let me know if that works for you.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
