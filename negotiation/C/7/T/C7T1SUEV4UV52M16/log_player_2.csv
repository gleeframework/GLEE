Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,150,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,200,000.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product for $1,000,000 from John."
