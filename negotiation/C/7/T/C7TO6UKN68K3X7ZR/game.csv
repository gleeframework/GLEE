"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see that you really want this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $8,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. How about we settle on $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're a tough negotiator, Bob! I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already compromised quite a bit. I'm willing to meet you at $7,500, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",7500.0,Alice,5,
