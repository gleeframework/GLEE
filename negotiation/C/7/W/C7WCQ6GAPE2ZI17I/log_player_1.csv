"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a significant amount, and I believe it reflects the value you've placed on it while still leaving room for both of us to benefit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 undervalues the true potential of this product.
