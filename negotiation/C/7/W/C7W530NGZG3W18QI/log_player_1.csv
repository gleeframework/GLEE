We're getting close!  $1,625,000 is just $25,000 away from my last offer, so I'm going to try and get that little bit more. I have 4 rounds left, and there's still potential for a better deal."

```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but we are down to our last two rounds. At this point, I'm not confident I can get a higher offer from Bob within these remaining rounds. Since I am guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, it's the safer option to sell to him and secure the deal."
