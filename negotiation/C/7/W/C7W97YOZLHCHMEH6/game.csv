"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price is fair and leaves room for us both to benefit from the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $850,000 is too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This reflects the product's true value while still providing you with a significant gain.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm happy to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise. It allows us to both get a good deal while keeping the transaction moving forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
