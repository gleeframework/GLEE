Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it presents significant value, even at this price. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this scenario, there's a slight chance Bob might try to negotiate a lower price, giving me a small buffer to still meet my minimum."
