Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and offers a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** Offering $950,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate while staying above your minimum.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique"" nature and ""true worth"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value.

**The goal:** 
* Ideally, Bob accepts the $950,000 offer.
* If Bob negotiates, you have room to go down slightly while still making a significant profit.
* If Bob rejects the offer outright, you're secure knowing John will buy it at your desired price."
