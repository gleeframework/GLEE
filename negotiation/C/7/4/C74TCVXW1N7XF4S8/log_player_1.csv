"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and expressing confidence in the deal. This approach aims to create a positive first impression and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm aiming for a higher price. While $12,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a better deal with some negotiation.  I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $13,000? This price still reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer at $13,000, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. I'm reiterating the value of the product and emphasizing the fairness of the deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the flexibility. Considering the value of the product and my budget, would it be possible to settle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, $12,500 is a good deal considering it's only $500 less than what John is offering. I'm prioritizing closing the deal and securing a profit, rather than potentially risking a longer negotiation process with uncertain outcomes."
