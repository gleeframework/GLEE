"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $1200000 is significantly above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but my maximum offer is $800000. This reflects the value I place on it and is my best possible price. I'm eager to work with you if this is a possibility.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1000000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",950000.0,Alice,5,
