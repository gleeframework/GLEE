"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price. There's still room for a deal, and you have the option of buying from John if negotiations fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While she has come down from her initial price, I'm still not comfortable paying $1,000,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I truly believe it's a fair price given the value I place on the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $950000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  I've already made two counteroffers and it seems like we are not going to reach an agreement. At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $800,000. It's within my budget and avoids further negotiation."
