"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is unfortunately way too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $5,000 is too low. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500.  Let me know if that works for you.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value. How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final move.  How about $8,000? This would be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with. Let's close this deal!",8000.0,Alice,7,
