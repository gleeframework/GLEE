"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000), but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and potentially negotiate.
* **Value Proposition:** I highlight the product's value to him, making the offer more appealing. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:**  $5,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to control the negotiation and potentially get a better price.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $5,000 is unfortunately way too low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a Middle Ground:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's offer ($5,000) and my previous offer ($12,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm still emphasizing the product's worth to Bob, making the price more palatable.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone keeps the negotiation open and encourages Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $5,000 is too low. I'm willing to increase my offer to $6,500.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Too Low:** $6,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Time to Increase Pressure:** While Bob has shown some willingness to move, I'm not ready to settle for such a low price. I need to see if I can push for something closer to my value. 
* **John is Still an Option:**  Remember, I can always sell to John for $15,000. This keeps Bob aware that I have alternative options. 

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $6,500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Would you consider $9,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Continuing to Increase Pressure:**  I'm raising the price again, demonstrating that I'm not ready to settle for a low price.
* **Compromise and Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a compromise, suggesting that it's fair to both parties.
* **Value Focus:**  I'm still reminding Bob about the product's value to him, reinforcing why this price is justified.

This counteroffer puts the pressure back on Bob and moves us closer to my desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on the value. How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is an increase, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob. I have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, which gives me the power to hold out for a better deal.
* **Time to Close the Gap:**  Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Bob and encourages him to make a more significant jump in his offer. 

I'll continue the negotiations with Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $10,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to make a final move.  How about $8,000? This would be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Move:** This counteroffer is a clear signal that I'm getting close to my final price.
* **Emphasis on Deal:** The ""let's close this deal!"" line adds a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to make a decision. 
* **Midpoint Compromise:** The price is between my previous offer ($9,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the benefits for Bob, making it easier for him to accept.

This counteroffer is a strong final move, hopefully enough to convince Bob to accept a price closer to my desired range."
