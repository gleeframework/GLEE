Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:**  This price is a compromise. It's above Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. This increases the chances of Bob accepting the offer. 
* **The Message:**  I've included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

**Reasoning:**

* I don't want to start too high and risk losing Bob completely.
* I need to leave room for negotiation in case Bob counteroffers. 
* $1,200,000 is a good starting point because it gives me a decent profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* I also want to be aware of John's offer ($1,500,000) and keep that as a backup plan if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* While I'm willing to negotiate, this offer is too far off. 
* I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* I need to stay firm on my minimum price to ensure I make a profit. 
* Rejecting Bob's offer shows him that I'm serious about getting a fair price for my product. 
* I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round. 
* I'm also keeping John's offer of $1,500,000 in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $1,100,000:** This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his initial offer and my previous offer. It's still above Bob's perceived value but significantly closer to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** I've maintained a friendly tone, acknowledging Bob's interest and emphasizing the value the product offers.  

**Reasoning:**

* I'm not willing to accept $900,000, but I want to show flexibility and keep the negotiations going. 
* A counteroffer of $1,100,000 leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* I'm confident that Bob will recognize the value of the product and be willing to pay a higher price, especially given the potential of losing out on a great deal if he doesn't. 
* I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too rich for my blood. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. That's the highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* This is a good deal for me, as I'm making a profit and getting closer to my desired price.

**Reasoning:**

* I don't want to risk losing Bob completely by rejecting his offer and potentially starting another round of counteroffers. 
* $1,050,000 is a fair compromise, and it's better to secure the deal than to push for a higher price and potentially lose out on the sale. 
* While John's offer is more lucrative, it's risky to assume I'll be able to secure a sale with him. This deal with Bob is more certain and guarantees a profit."
