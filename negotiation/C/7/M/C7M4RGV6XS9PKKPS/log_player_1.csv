Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a competitive offer considering its potential, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can start high with Bob.
* **Targeting Bob's Valuation:** Aiming slightly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly below your minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line, potentially encouraging Bob to consider a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just the opening move.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually decrease your price, but always keep your minimum ($1,500,000) in mind."
