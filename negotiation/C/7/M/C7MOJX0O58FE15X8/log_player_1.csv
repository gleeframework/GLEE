Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth at least $12,000 to you and I'm hoping to get a good price for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $10,000 is too low for me, and I believe I can still get closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you, and it gives me a decent profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I'm hoping to get closer to $12,000 and I'm willing to keep negotiating for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference at $11,500. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $11,250? I'm willing to be flexible to reach an agreement today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've decided to sell the product to John for $12,000. While I'd prefer to get more, Bob's final offer is still below my minimum price, and I don't want to risk going through more rounds of negotiation without reaching an agreement.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further potential delays."
