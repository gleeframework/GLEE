"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is a starting point, but it's still significantly higher than both her value and the price I'm willing to pay.  I should make a counteroffer to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's offer to give myself room for negotiation. This also signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Polite and Respectful:** Maintaining a positive tone is important for a successful negotiation.  
* **Targeting a Fair Price:** I'm aiming for a price that's closer to Alice's perceived value ($80) while still leaving me some savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice met me halfway between our previous offers. $85 is a good price, well below my maximum budget and saving me $35 compared to John.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I push further, Alice might walk away, and I'd end up paying more to John. 
* **Time Saved:**  Accepting now avoids further back-and-forth negotiation."
