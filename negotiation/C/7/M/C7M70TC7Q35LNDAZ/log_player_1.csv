{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}

This offer sets a starting point that's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also establishes a friendly tone to encourage a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 85}
