"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $70 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $85? It's a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it's closer to my minimum. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground.",85.0,Alice,3,
