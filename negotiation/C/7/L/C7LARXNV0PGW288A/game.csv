"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but your asking price is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $990,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows how serious I am about closing this deal.",990000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your effort to come up with a better offer. However, $990,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise for $1,000,000. This price is at the bottom of my range, but it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1000000.0,Alice,7,
