Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This price still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to my desired price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $975,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,012,500. This is a fair compromise, and it leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to come up with a better offer. However, $990,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise for $1,000,000. This price is at the bottom of my range, but it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice has come down to your maximum price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might lead to a worse outcome or risk running out of rounds.  It's best to accept the offer now and secure the product at your target price."
