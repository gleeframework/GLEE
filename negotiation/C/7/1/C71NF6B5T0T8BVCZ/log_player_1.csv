"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love! I'm asking $110 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum value ($100) to give myself room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message positive and enthusiastic to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Value Proposition:** I briefly mention the product's value to make it seem appealing. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for negotiation, as Bob is likely to counter with a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While I'd like to close the deal, Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob with further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to explore other options.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than his offer but still lower than my initial offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while maintaining my bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $95? I'm confident you'll still get a great deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm making a counteroffer to Bob, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Split the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($110) and Bob's offer ($90). This is a common tactic in negotiation to find a compromise.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive tone, emphasizing the ""great deal"" Bob will still get.
* **Maintaining Minimum:** My counteroffer of $95 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $92.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my minimum price, his offer of $92.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I'm confident I can still achieve a better price through further negotiation.
* **Time Remaining:** With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer again, trying to inch closer to my target price of $100.  I'll aim for a price slightly higher than $92.50, but still lower than my previous counteroffer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you.  $92.50 is closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground.  Let's try $94.  This is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product, and it lets me keep my business running.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continued Negotiation:** I'm demonstrating my flexibility by offering a price that's slightly higher than Bob's latest offer but still lower than my previous counteroffer.
* **Focusing on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing fairness and value in my message, appealing to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining Minimum:**  My counteroffer of $94 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly hinting that I'm willing to negotiate but not indefinitely, adding a touch of urgency to the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to keep your business running, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we try $91.50? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiation is getting lengthy.  
* **Low Offers:** Bob's offer of $91.50 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:**  Selling to John guarantees me a sale at my minimum price.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob and losing out on a sale is too high.

**Conclusion:**

It's better to secure a guaranteed sale with John at $100 than to risk losing the sale altogether by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
