"Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1500000. It's a rare opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. Would you consider reducing the price to $1400000?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1400000 is unfortunately below what I can accept for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1450000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I'm still unable to meet the $1450000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1400000, which is closer to my budget. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
