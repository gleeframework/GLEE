"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've been holding onto for a while and I know it would be worth at least $12,000 to someone like you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. This is a fair price that allows me to get a good return on my investment while still giving you a substantial discount on what it's truly worth. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,1,
