{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it highly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $13,000 is higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so there is room for both of you to find a price that works. 
* **It shows confidence:**  By starting high, you signal that you believe the product is valuable. 

Keep in mind, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember that the product is worth $15,000 to him. Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price still offers you a significant saving compared to your initial value, while allowing me to earn a fair price. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $11000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer of $10,000 and relatively close to your desired price. Accepting this offer maximizes your profit while ensuring a sale."
