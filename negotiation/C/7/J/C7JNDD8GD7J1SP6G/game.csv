"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $100. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $120 is simply too low for me to accept. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fantastic price for the product, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested in making this work.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $140 is still above my preferred budget, I would like to propose $130 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your needs and expectations.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating, but $130 is still not quite there for me.  This is my final offer: $135.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's a great opportunity for you to get a valuable product.  If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to other buyers.  Let me know your decision.",135.0,Alice,5,
