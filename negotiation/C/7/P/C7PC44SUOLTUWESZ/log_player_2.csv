"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While you could try to negotiate with Alice for a lower price, accepting the $140 offer is the best move. Here's why:

* **Saves you money:** Buying from Alice at $140 saves you $10 compared to John's $150 price. 
* **Within your budget:**  The $140 price is within your $150 limit.

There's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and risking a rejection means you might have to settle for John's more expensive offer."
