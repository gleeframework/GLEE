,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $105. What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $110? That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to what I need.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $110 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  How about $107? It's a fair compromise, and we can both save some money.",107.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. How about $109?  That's a fair price for both of us.",109.0,Alice,5,
