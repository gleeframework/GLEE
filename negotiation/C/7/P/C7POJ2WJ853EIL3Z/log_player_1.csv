Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, aiming higher with Bob could net you a better deal.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,350,000 price is significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but still offers him a substantial saving compared to your backup offer from John. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning other buyers and a time limit, you introduce a sense of urgency and make the offer seem more desirable.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:** This initial offer opens the door for negotiation with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to go lower or stick closer to your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Bob's Perspective:** You don't know how much Bob is willing to pay above his perceived value.  There's a chance he might reject this offer outright."
