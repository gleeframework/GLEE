"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Establish interest:** Showing interest keeps Alice engaged. 
* **Provide a reason for a lower price:**  Phrases like ""a bit steep"" are subjective but imply the price is the main issue, not the product itself. 
* **Offer a significant but not insulting counter:** $70 is a decent jump down, but it's still a profitable price for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I can do $85, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice moved closer to a desirable price, there's still potential for negotiation. We're aiming for a price below $80, and going one more round is worth the risk before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Acknowledge the compromise:** Alice lowered her price, so we acknowledge that to show good faith.
* **Propose a specific solution:** ""Meeting in the middle"" sounds fair and gives a clear target.
* **Maintain a firm stance:** $75 keeps us below our $80 limit while still leaving some wiggle room if Alice pushes back."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we do $82.50? That's as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer.  While slightly above our ideal target, $82.50 is a reasonable price and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
