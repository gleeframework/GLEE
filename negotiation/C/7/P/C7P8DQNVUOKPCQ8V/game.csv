"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I think the product's value is worth it, and I'm willing to make a slight concession to meet you in the middle. How about we meet at $102.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",102.5,Alice,5,
