"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider a price of $11,500.  This feels like a fair compromise.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $11,500 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  How about $7,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
