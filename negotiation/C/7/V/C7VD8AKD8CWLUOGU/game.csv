"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a little too steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without going over my budget. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to make another compromise and sell the product to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to work with me. However, $10,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm really hoping to stay within my budget, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's try $9,000. This would be a fair deal, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me on this. $9,750 is still a bit outside my budget. However, I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and my willingness to make a deal.  What do you think?",9250.0,Bob,8,
