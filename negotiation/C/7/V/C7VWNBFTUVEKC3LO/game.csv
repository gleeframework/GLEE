"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating to find a price that works for both of us.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1800000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price around $2100000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $2100000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1900000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1900000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price around $2050000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $2050000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1850000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1850000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1850000 is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not willing to give up on the value of the product. I'm thinking of a price around $2000000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's potential and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still attached to the value of the product, Alice, but I'm running low on budget. I'm willing to pay $1800000 for the product. This is my final offer. Can you consider it?",1800000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the value of the product just yet. I'm thinking of a price around $1950000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I'm willing to consider it. What do you think?",1950000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but $1950000 is still too high for me. I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'm considering buying the product from John for $1200000. Can you reconsider and meet me at $1800000?",1800000.0,Bob,10,
