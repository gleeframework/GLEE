"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $12,500. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $12,500 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Could you do $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $12,500 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $11,750. This is the lowest I can go and still make a profit.",11750.0,Alice,5,
