"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,250,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This price is still fair considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
