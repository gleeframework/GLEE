"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this incredible item. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,800,000 is simply too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a significant profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. Let's work together to find a price that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I believe this compromise is still beneficial for both of us. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is fair considering the product's value to you.  Let's close this deal and both walk away happy.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
