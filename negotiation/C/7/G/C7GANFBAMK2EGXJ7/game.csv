"I'm very interested in the product, but $1450000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1200000 is a bit below my minimum, I appreciate your interest. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the slight reduction, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer, I'm still looking to get a bit more for this valuable product.  Would you consider $1325000? It's a small step up from your offer, but I think it's a fair price given the product's potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
