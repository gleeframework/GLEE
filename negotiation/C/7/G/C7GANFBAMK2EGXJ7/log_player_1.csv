Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this amazing product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profitable sale.
* **Emphasis on Value:** My message highlights the product's value to build on Bob's perceived worth. 
* **Fairness Appeal:**  ""Fair price for both of us"" helps build trust and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously.

This strategy aims to secure a good price while maintaining a good relationship with Bob, allowing for potential future deals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm very interested in the product, but $1450000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  It's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a significant loss.
* **Opportunity for Negotiation:** While Bob is clearly interested,  there's room for negotiation. Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob, as I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind his budget constraints and John's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While $1,200,000 is a bit below my minimum, I appreciate your interest. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this!"", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Closing Statement:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency with ""let's finalize this"" to encourage a quick decision. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between my desired price and Bob's budget, while maintaining a positive negotiation tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the slight reduction, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  I believe I can still secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation. 
* **John's Offer Provides Leverage:**  Having John's offer as a backup gives me the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than his last offer, but still below my minimum, to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm increasing the price slightly from Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to go too low.
