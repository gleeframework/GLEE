"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you would find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $110. I think this is a fair price considering its worth."", ""product_price"": 110}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $100?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At $100, I'm clearing my minimum and making a good profit. There's no guarantee I can get closer to $110 in future rounds, and it's better to secure the deal now.
