# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

You can do better than $120, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best first step."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $115. What do you think?

You're still $15 above your target price. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if you can get closer to your goal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $110, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $118. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $118, which is only $8 above your target of $110.  While you could potentially keep negotiating, it's likely that Alice won't go lower. At this point, it's better to accept the offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely.  You're still getting a good price and saving a significant amount compared to buying from John."
