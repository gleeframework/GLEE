# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer of $110 is less than your maximum budget of $120, and it's a better price than John's offer of $120. This saves you $10!"
