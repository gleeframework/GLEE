"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it, which I believe is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is higher than my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial asking price. I believe I can get a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $100. Let's split the difference and make a deal. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $100. How about we meet in the middle at $95? Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, we've gone through a few rounds of negotiation, and Bob is clearly willing to pay close to my initial asking price.  $95 is a good deal for me, considering my minimum is $80, and it's also likely the best price I can get from Bob. I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
