Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's counteroffers are getting smaller, indicating we might be nearing his maximum. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Bob is getting closer, but we still have room to negotiate.  It's worth one more counteroffer to see if we can break $1.2 million."

Round 7

While we didn't reach $1.2 million, $1,170,000 is a strong price, and Bob's offer is unlikely to increase significantly in the remaining rounds.  It's better to accept a good offer now than risk losing the deal entirely."
