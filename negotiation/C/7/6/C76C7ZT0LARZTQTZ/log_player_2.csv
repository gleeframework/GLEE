"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

This is a good deal, but you can likely do better. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a final counteroffer of $725,000.

While you could continue to negotiate, Alice has already made several concessions.  Accepting her final offer of $725,000 saves you a significant amount compared to buying from John and is likely the best deal you can get."
