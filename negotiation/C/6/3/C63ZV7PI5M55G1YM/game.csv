"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  This price reflects the true value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
