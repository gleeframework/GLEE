"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe you'll find it to be a game-changer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1200000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $800000 for this product. Let me know if you're interested in working with me.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's a fair price given the product's value. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1000000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm willing to meet you at $950000, which is a compromise between our last two offers. This is the closest I can get to your price without going below my minimum value for the product. Let me know if this is acceptable to you.",950000.0,Alice,5,
