"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer yet. I'll see if I can negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,600,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures a successful transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $1,500,000 would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget.  Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering the maximum value he's willing to pay, and it's equal to what John is offering. I'll accept and close the deal."
