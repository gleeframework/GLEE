{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $1,600,000? This gives us both a good deal and ensures a successful transaction.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if I can get a better deal. There's still some room for compromise, and I have more rounds to work with."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling $1,500,000 would be a fair price that benefits both of us.  This is my final offer, and it aligns with my budget.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
