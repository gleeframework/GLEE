"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $17,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $15,500? That seems like a fair compromise to me.",15500.0,Bob,4,
