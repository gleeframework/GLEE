``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a higher price than my minimum, but I'm also leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, but I'm prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer. While $1,600,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, as he clearly values the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget. I'm willing to come down to $1,650,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1650000} 
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum. I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping that Bob sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,600,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum. While I would have preferred a higher price, I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for a lower price.  I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
