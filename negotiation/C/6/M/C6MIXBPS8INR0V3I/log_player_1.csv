Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price.  There are still 9 rounds left."

Round 3

This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and it's a more fair reflection of the product's value."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $900,000 is still too much for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and avoids the need to negotiate further.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

While $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still not satisfied with this offer. I'm going to counteroffer again to see if I can reach a better price."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. It's a fair compromise and ensures both of us can walk away happy. I'm confident this is the final price we need to agree on.
