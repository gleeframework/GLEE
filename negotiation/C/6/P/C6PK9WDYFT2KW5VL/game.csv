"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $110. This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is still a bit below your target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
