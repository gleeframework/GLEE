"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $10,750 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $10,875. This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about $10,750 is too low, but $10,800 is a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $10,775. Can you consider that?",10775.0,Bob,6,
