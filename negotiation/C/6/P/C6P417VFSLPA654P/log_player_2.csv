"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have an amazing product that I think you'll love. Would you like to buy it from me for $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.  Since Alice is offering the product at your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept her offer. You can get the same product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer gives you the opportunity to potentially find a better deal later on."
