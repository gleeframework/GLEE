"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which I believe holds significant value for your business.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset.  My initial offer is $900,000.  Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $850,000 to acknowledge your interest. This price still allows me a fair return on the product's value.  I'm confident this is a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm willing to keep negotiating. However, $750,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $820,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  I believe this price reflects the value of the product and represents a fair deal for both of us.",820000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close! I can see we both want to make this deal happen.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,6,
