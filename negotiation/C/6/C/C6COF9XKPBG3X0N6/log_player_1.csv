Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 145} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that's higher than my minimum but still leaves room for potential negotiation. It's a starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay close to the maximum value the product holds for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below the product's value to Bob. I'll try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. $140 is a compromise that might be more appealing to Bob while still giving me a profit closer to the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $135 is closer to my desired price point and is still a good deal for me. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a chance Bob might walk away completely.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
