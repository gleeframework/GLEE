"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000** is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.** I highlight the value of the product to him, making it more appealing. 

**Strategy:**

By offering a substantial discount initially, I aim to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest.** If he rejects, it gives me information about his potential counteroffer. 
* **Encourage a counteroffer.** This keeps the negotiation moving and allows for a potential win-win scenario.
* **Set a benchmark for further negotiations.**  

I will carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy in the following rounds. Remember, I always have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't reach a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.**  I'm not desperate to sell and can still aim for a better deal.
* **I'll use the next round to make a counteroffer.** This will show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. 
* **I'll need to be careful to avoid a stalemate.**  I need to find a price point that is acceptable to both Bob and me."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This gives you a good deal while ensuring I can still turn a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The counteroffer is a compromise.** It's higher than Bob's offer but significantly lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **The message is positive and focuses on the benefits for both parties.** I emphasize the ""good deal"" for Bob and the need for a ""profit"" for myself. This helps create a win-win mindset.
* **$1,050,000 is a strategically chosen price point.** It's a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting a potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

By making this counteroffer, I hope to:

* **Show Bob that I'm serious about negotiating.**
* **Encourage a counteroffer closer to my desired price.**
* **Keep the negotiation moving towards a deal.**

I will be prepared to adjust my offer further if necessary, but I aim to close this deal with a price that is acceptable to both of us."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better offer. I'm not desperate to sell and want to continue negotiating.

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer shows I'm not willing to settle for a low price.** It keeps the negotiation open and puts pressure on Bob to come up with a higher offer.
* **I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.** My counteroffer will be a compromise, but closer to my desired price point than Bob's offer.
* **I'll closely monitor the number of rounds left.** If the negotiation stalls, I can always sell to John for $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still a little low for me. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give up too much. 
* **Message emphasizes fairness:**  Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us helps create a win-win mindset. 
* **Strategic price point:** $1,000,000 is a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's current offer. It's a reasonable compromise.

**Strategy:**

* **Pushing for a better deal:** I'm not settling yet, but I'm also being realistic about Bob's limitations.
* **Keeping the negotiation moving:**  I'm aiming for a deal in the next few rounds. 
* **Monitoring time:** I'll consider selling to John if the negotiations stall."

**Strategy:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open.** I'm not desperate to sell and want to see if I can push for a higher price. 
* **I'll make a counteroffer in the next round.** It will be a compromise, but closer to my desired price point than Bob's offer.
* **I'm considering selling to John.** With limited rounds remaining, I'm starting to weigh the potential of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  But $920,000 is simply too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, let's meet at $975,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility.
* **Message emphasizes fairness:** Highlighting the ""good deal"" for both of us helps create a win-win mindset.
* **Strategic price point:** $975,000 is closer to Bob's offer, signaling I'm getting closer to a potential agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Trying to close the deal:** With only three rounds left, I'm pushing for a deal with a slightly lower offer. 
* **Still aiming for a decent profit:** $975,000 is still above my minimum price and provides a decent profit margin.
* **Considering selling to John:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit far from the price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob has stalled.  His offer of $910,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,500,000. It's unlikely he will come up to a price I find acceptable in the next round.  

**Strategy:**

* **Time is running out.** It's becoming increasingly risky to continue negotiating with Bob, as I might not be able to reach a satisfactory price. 
* **Guaranteed profit with John.** Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of a further decrease in price from Bob. 
* **Protecting my interests.** It's important to prioritize securing a good price and not risk ending up with a low-profit deal.

By selling to John, I am maximizing my profits and ensuring a successful outcome for myself."
