Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or makes an acceptance at the initial price more profitable.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $135 is a price point that allows Bob to potentially feel like he's getting a deal (saving $15 from his perceived value), while still giving you a significant profit margin over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, so there's no pressure to go below your minimum. This strengthens your position."
