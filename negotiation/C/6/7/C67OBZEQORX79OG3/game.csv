"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get as close to my minimum price of $1,200,000 as possible.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product,  $1,100,000 is a bit too steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,000,000. This price is fair, and it allows us to both close the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,075,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1,075,000. This price is still below my minimum, but I'm hoping we can find a compromise.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
