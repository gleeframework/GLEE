Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $860,000 is a decent amount and it's better than selling to John for $800,000. We're close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
