Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential.  Let's find a more realistic middle ground - how about $1,400,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing a significant gap between our valuations.  While I want to find a solution that works for both of us, I need to be realistic about the product's value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a substantial offer, reflecting the product's true worth.

Alice is unlikely to come down much further, and it's not worth the risk of her walking away entirely. John's offer is a sure thing and saves $25,000."
