"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I'd be happy to buy it from you at that price.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $110 is a better offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $108? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I really want to make this deal work. How about $109? That's just a dollar more than your offer, and it would be a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $109 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $107? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.0,Bob,6,
