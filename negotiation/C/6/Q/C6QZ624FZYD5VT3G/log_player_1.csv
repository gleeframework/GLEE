Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement at a slightly lower price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,800 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,800 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about $11,200? That's a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a price that's still beneficial for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,200 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $11,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate."
