"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than your estimated value and I'll be able to make a significant profit. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit and me to get a great deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  It's important for me to make a reasonable profit on this sale.  I'm willing to come down a little more, and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a great deal.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than the first offer, it's still higher than Bob's target.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,087,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. Let's close this deal and move on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,087,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,087,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
