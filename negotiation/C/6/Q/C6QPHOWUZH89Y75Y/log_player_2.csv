"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's fair for both of us. Let's talk about a price of $12,500. This gives you a great deal, and me a fair return on my investment.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,500 is better for Bob than buying from John for $15,000.  Although Bob's maximum value is $15,000, getting the product for $12,500 still saves him money."
