"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $1,300,000? That's a significant compromise on my end, reflecting my desire to see this deal done.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
