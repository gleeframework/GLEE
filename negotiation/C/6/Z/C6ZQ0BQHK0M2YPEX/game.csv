"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business.

"Thanks for your offer, Alice. I recognize the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, Bob. However, I'm still confident that the product's value to you is significantly higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's value to you while also being a fair price for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,050,000, but that's as high as I can go.  Do we have a deal?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a deal that will work for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
