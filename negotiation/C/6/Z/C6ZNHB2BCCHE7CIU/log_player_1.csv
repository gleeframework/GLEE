Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum threshold. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully incentivizes Bob to make a counteroffer. I'm also aware of John's offer, so I have a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer but still higher than his perceived value. I'm hoping to meet somewhere in the middle and find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I've already had two rounds of negotiation and it doesn't seem like he's willing to go much higher.  John's offer is a guaranteed $15,000, which meets my minimum requirement and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
