Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget. At this point, the negotiation is taking too long and the risk of further counteroffers exceeding my budget is high. It's more efficient to buy the product from John, as this offer is within my budget and guarantees a purchase."
