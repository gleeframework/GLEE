Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning he has a potential profit of $500,000 if he buys it for $1,000,000.
* **The Sweet Spot:**  You want to find a price that earns you significantly more than $1,000,000 but is still enticing enough for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This gives you a chance to leverage its value for substantial gain."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Highlighting that this is an ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and importance.
* **Fairness:** By stating ""a fair price,"" you frame the offer as mutually beneficial rather than a hard bargain.
* **Value-Oriented:**  Focusing on the ""potential"" and ""substantial gain"" speaks directly to Bob's motivation.
* **Price Point:**  $1,350,000 allows Bob a $150,000 potential profit, while you secure a significant $350,000 profit over your backup offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is prone to hard bargaining, you might start slightly higher to allow room for negotiation. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is crucial, a slightly less aggressive approach might be beneficial. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate."
