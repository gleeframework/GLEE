{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial price is $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
 Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to try to get a better price.  The product is worth $1,500,000 to him, so I'm sure I can get closer to that number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,100,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is getting closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $1,200,000. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for me, and it's still a good price for Bob considering the product's value to him.  I'm going to accept his offer."
