Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $10,000.  This is a starting point and I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again.  If the negotiations drag on, I'll always have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I get at least my minimum price."
