Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The price range where a deal can happen is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob walks away.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer, you have leverage.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I've had significant interest, but I believe you would benefit greatly from it. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,450,000."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You start by highlighting the product's value and the demand for it. 
* **High Anchor:**  $1,450,000 is a strong starting point, leaving room for negotiation but staying firmly within a profitable range for you.
* **No Justification:**  Avoid giving specific reasons for the price. This lets Bob respond with his valuation.

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate. Bob will likely counter, and you might need to come down slightly. However, with John as a backup, you are in a strong position to achieve a favorable outcome."
