{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000.  It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as fair and reasonable, emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob. This might encourage him to consider it seriously.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves room for a counteroffer from Bob, allowing the negotiation to progress.
* **Attractive Price:** While still a high price, it's lower than my minimum, potentially enticing Bob to make a deal.
* **Focus on Value:** By highlighting the product's worth to Bob, I'm attempting to build a foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Based on Bob's response, I'll adjust my strategy. If he counteroffers, I'll consider his offer and make a counteroffer of my own.
* **John as a Backup:** I'm keeping John as a backup option in case the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me leverage and ensures I can still obtain my minimum value."

# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. I'm getting closer to a deal, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,050,000. How about $1,000,000?

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,500,000. While we've been negotiating, I've consistently emphasized my minimum price and the value of the product.

* **Negotiation Stalemate:**  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob might not lead to a better price, and continuing would only risk losing John's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Contact John:** I will immediately contact John and finalize the sale, ensuring I receive the $1,500,000.
* **Learn from the Experience:** I will reflect on this negotiation and identify areas for improvement in future transactions, considering different strategies and approaches."
