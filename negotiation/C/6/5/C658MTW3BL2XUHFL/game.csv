"Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more so than you realize. It's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I think that's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the product's potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial constraints.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me and allows me to acquire it without exceeding my financial limits.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
