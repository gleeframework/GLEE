"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to your operations, even more so than you realize. It's truly one-of-a-kind. I'm offering it to you for $1,500,000. I think that's a fair price considering the potential return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an ambitious offer. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's true interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's unique value and potential ROI, I'm attempting to justify the high asking price.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to make a deal below my minimum, but I'm willing to negotiate to get the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. Given the product's potential value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that allows me to acquire the product while remaining within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can secure a better deal.  I'll use the next round to counter his offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is significantly below the true value of this product.  I'm confident it will generate substantial returns for your business.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm continuing to emphasize the product's potential to generate returns, subtly justifying the higher price.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident this product will be valuable, but I need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This price reflects the product's value to me and allows me to acquire it without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer now matches John's standing offer of $1,200,000. While I started higher, hoping for a better deal, it's unlikely Bob will go much higher.  Accepting this offer secures my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a worse outcome."
