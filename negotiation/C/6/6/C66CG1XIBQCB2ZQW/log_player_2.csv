"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is far too high. It's important to bring the price down significantly.  Buying from John at this stage would be premature, as there's room to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  That price is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $700,000 is a low offer compared to Alice's asking price, it establishes a baseline closer to my budget. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** This initial counteroffer leaves ample room for negotiation over the remaining rounds. I expect Alice to counter, and I'm prepared to increase my offer gradually.
* **Not Buying from John Yet:**  It's too early to buy from John.  There's a chance of getting a better deal with Alice, even if it means going higher than $700,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is significantly below its value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true potential of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice reduced her price, it's still far too high. There's no need to jump to John just yet.  We'll continue negotiating, demonstrating a willingness to move upward but at a controlled pace."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but we're still quite far apart on price. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This is a significant jump from my previous offer and demonstrates my seriousness about purchasing the product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Substantial Increase:** A $200,000 increase from the previous offer shows Alice that I'm serious and willing to move closer to her range.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The offer remains below my $1,000,000 limit while still leaving some room for further negotiation in later rounds. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By steadily increasing the offer, I'm encouraging Alice to consider lower prices without resorting to buying from John just yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end, while still reflecting the inherent value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** Even with Alice's significant reduction, $1,700,000 is significantly above your $800,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still five rounds left, offering space to negotiate further. Alice's willingness to lower her price by $300,000 suggests she's open to further negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** The option to buy from John for $800,000 gives you a strong bargaining position. While you haven't revealed this option to Alice, it provides a safety net if negotiations stall."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but we still have some ground to cover. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a considerable increase on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Movement:** Offering $1,100,000 represents a substantial increase from the previous $900,000, demonstrating your willingness to move towards a deal.
* **Middle Ground:** This offer aims for a middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's current price. It shows you're serious about negotiating while still leaving room for further adjustments. 
* **Time Constraint:** With only five rounds remaining, it's essential to start narrowing the gap more aggressively. This offer aims to encourage Alice to do the same."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to drop to $1,450,000. This is a significant move on my end, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $1,450,000 is better, but it's still significantly more than your $800,000 limit.
* **Positive Trajectory:** Alice continues to lower her price, indicating she's motivated to sell.
* **Time to Push:** With only three rounds left, it's time to be more assertive and push the price closer to your target.  You can afford to be a bit more risky now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close, but that price is still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $1,200,000. That's a very strong offer, and I think it's fair given the time we have left to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This offer balances firmness with a willingness to compromise.  The $1,200,000 price point shows you're serious but sets a clear upper limit. 
* **Time Pressure:** By highlighting the limited negotiation time, you're subtly reminding Alice that a deal needs to be reached soon.
* **Alternative in Mind:** While you haven't revealed your option to buy from John, it gives you leverage.  If Alice doesn't move significantly in the next round, you'll be ready to walk away."
