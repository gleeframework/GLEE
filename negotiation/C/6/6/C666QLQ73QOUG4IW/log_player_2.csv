"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

Alice's offer is too high. It's better to counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  Given my maximum budget and the value I see in the product, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $850,000 is a significant offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is still too high.  We can likely get a better price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000.  This is the maximum I can afford, and it represents a significant investment for me.  I'm confident this price is fair given the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position, but the gap between our valuations is substantial.  I'm willing to make one final concession to find a solution.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a considerable compromise on my end and reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price.  While $950,000 is still above my ideal price, it's a good deal compared to her initial asking price. It's also only $50,000 more than what I could get from John.  I'm going to accept this offer."
