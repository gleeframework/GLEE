"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Could we consider $1800000 for the product?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1800000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $2200000?",2200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to keep the price within my budget. Let's try $2000000 as a compromise.",2000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $2200000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $100000. So, the total value would be $2300000. What do you think?",2300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for considering my budget. While I appreciate the service package, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my limit. Would $2100000 be acceptable to you?",2100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're close to your limit, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $2400000? I'll throw in the service package again, and I'll also include a 2-year warranty, which is a $50000 value. The total value would be $2450000. What do you think?",2400000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've considered your latest proposal, but I'm still not able to meet you at that price. I'm willing to pay up to $2200000 for the product, including all the additional benefits. Is there any way we can come to an agreement that works for both of us?",2200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too far apart. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll sell the product to you for $2400000, but I need you to agree to a 5-year maintenance contract, which is a $75000 value. The total value would be $2475000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",2400000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I'm still committed to staying within my budget. I'm willing to pay $2300000 for the product, including any maintenance or additional services. This is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement.",2300000.0,Bob,10,
