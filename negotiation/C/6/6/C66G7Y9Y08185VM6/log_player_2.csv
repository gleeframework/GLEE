It's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. $65 is a decent starting point, but I can likely negotiate lower."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to my desired $100 limit.  If Alice rejects this, I'll assess her counteroffer and continue negotiating."

Alice is coming down a bit, but $60 is still too high. I'm going to try for a lower counteroffer."

Alice is still stubbornly holding out for a higher price, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer before I consider John.  $62 is too close to my limit, and I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of her."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

This is my final counteroffer. If Alice rejects it, I'll buy from John. I'm aiming for a price that's fair for both of us, but close enough to my $100 limit."

Alice is being stubborn. $64 is too close to my limit and I'm running out of rounds. It's time to cut my losses and buy from John."
