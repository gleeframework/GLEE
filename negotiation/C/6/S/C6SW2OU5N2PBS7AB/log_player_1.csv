Bob's offer:

This is a good point to accept the offer. Here's why:

* **Strong Profit:** $1,000,000 is a substantial profit margin, well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away or significantly lowering his offer. Accepting now guarantees a great outcome.
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal sooner allows you to reinvest the money or utilize it for other opportunities.
