"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'll really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 
* **10 Rounds:**  I have a good amount of time to negotiate, so I don't need to be too aggressive in the first round. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 gives me confidence to hold firm if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I still have 9 rounds, which is plenty of time to try to get closer to my desired price.
* **John as Backup:**  While $90 is better than nothing, I can do better. Knowing John will buy for $120 gives me the leverage to hold out for a higher price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $90 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $100.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  My counteroffer of $100 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum price. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone helps keep the negotiation open and avoids creating tension.
* **Reasoning:** I explain the counteroffer by highlighting the product's value, hoping to persuade Bob to accept a price closer to my desired price.
* **Open to Compromise:** The statement, ""Let's see if we can find a middle ground,"" shows flexibility and encourages further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $100, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price point.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I still have six rounds left, giving me ample time to continue negotiating.
* **John as Backup:**  The security of John's offer at $120 gives me the confidence to hold out for a better deal.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can reach an agreement closer to my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop to $97.50. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 97.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $97.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($95). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise and move towards a deal.
* **Empathy:** I acknowledge Bob's budget constraints, making him feel understood and increasing the chance of a positive response.
* **Highlighting Reduction:**  I emphasize that my counteroffer is a significant reduction, hoping to persuade Bob that it's a fair offer. 
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, promoting a collaborative negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  This counteroffer is a step closer to my minimum price point. If rejected, I can continue adjusting my offer to reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 6

# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum, even though he's shown a willingness to compromise.
* **Negotiation Room:** I still have four rounds left. There's time to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John's Offer:**  I can secure $120 from John. This makes me less willing to settle for a significantly lower price.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price to explore if we can find a middle ground that's closer to my minimum."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. How about we meet in the middle at $94.50? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and takes into account your budget. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 94.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $94.50, which is the midpoint between my previous offer ($97.50) and Bob's offer ($92). This demonstrates a continued commitment to finding common ground.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and encouraging tone, emphasizing a desire to ""make this deal happen"".
* **Reasoning:** I reiterate the value of the product and consider Bob's budget. This helps justify my counteroffer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This is my final counteroffer before reaching my minimum price point. If Bob rejects, I can consider selling to John.
* **Limited Time:** With only three rounds remaining, I need to be more assertive to secure a deal that's acceptable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $94.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $91? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $91
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $91 is still below my minimum, and we're down to the final few rounds.
* **John's Offer:**  I can secure $120 from John, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The potential to negotiate further with Bob is small, and there's a risk he might reject my final offer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  With only two rounds left, I don't have time to risk further negotiation. 

Selling to John guarantees a higher price and a quicker resolution. It's the best decision considering the current situation."
