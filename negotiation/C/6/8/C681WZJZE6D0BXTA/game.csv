"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value of this product is quite high, and $650,000 is significantly below what I can accept. Could you consider a figure closer to $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $725,000 is closer, I'm still seeking a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
