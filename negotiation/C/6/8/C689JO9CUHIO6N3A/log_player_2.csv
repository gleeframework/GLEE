While Alice has come down a bit, $1,050,000 is still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to counteroffer again."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $950,000, which would be $1,000,000. However, I'll throw in a small concession - I'll give you a 1% discount, so the price would be $990,000. This is my final offer. What do you think?
