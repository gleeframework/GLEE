Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While $80 is Bob's perceived value, he might be willing to pay a bit more depending on the product's scarcity or his need for it.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects your initial offer, you can gradually lower the price until you reach an agreement or decide to move on to John."
