"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for the product. Let me know what you think!",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $140. If you're not willing to go that low, I'll need to look at other options.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $140, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $155. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
