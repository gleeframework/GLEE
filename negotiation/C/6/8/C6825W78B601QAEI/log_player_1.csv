Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is a significant profit for me but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to Bob's value:**  I mention the product's value to him, subtly reminding him that it's a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers without risking a complete breakdown.
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000 gives me confidence to push for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and allows us both to get a good deal.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,050,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as his offer reflects a willingness to pay more than John. 
* **Stronger position:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain a stronger negotiating position, potentially forcing him to increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply not enough for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to both of us, subtly reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Setting a clear expectation:** I'm not willing to go lower than $1,100,000, signaling that I'm serious about securing a fair price.
* **Keeping John as a safety net:** If Bob rejects this offer, I can still fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer."
