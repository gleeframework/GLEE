"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1200000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This reflects the significant value this product holds.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1500000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1300000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to accept $1400000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the potential it offers.  Let's make a deal.",1400000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1350000, which is the highest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1350000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1375000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1325000, which is the absolute highest I can go. I hope we can meet at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,8,
