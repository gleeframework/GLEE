,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer but $18000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $12000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm really keen on this product, but I'm sticking with my offer of $12000.  If we can't agree on this price, I may have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, but I really need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $14000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see you're willing to negotiate, which is great. However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12000. I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more significant concession. I can offer it to you for $13500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm counting on you to make a decision. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad you're coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go to $13000, but that's my final offer. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $13000. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping you'll meet me in the middle. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,9,
