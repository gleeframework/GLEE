{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but leaves room for potential negotiation. It also provides a friendly and encouraging tone to foster a positive dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to take the $1,400,000, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll reject the offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I want to get the best price possible, Bob's offer of $1,450,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is willing to pay my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  I'm going to sell to John."
