Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a decent starting point - it's significantly higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to gauge Bob's interest at this price point before potentially moving closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $12,000. This is still a decent amount above my minimum, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this will lead to a more mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm not sure if I can get him to budge any higher. At this point, it's better to go with the guaranteed $10,000 from John."
