$200 is way over your budget. You need to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $200 is a stretch. However, $80 is significantly below its value. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $140? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140.

$140 is still more than you're willing to pay. You'll try to negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit high for me. Would you consider $100? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you drive a hard bargain! Let's make this happen. How about $125? That's my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Alice is coming down in price, but $125 is still more than your $80 limit. John is offering the product for your maximum budget, so it's the best option."
