"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. It's a significant drop from her initial price, but still leaves room for negotiation while staying well below your $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $120 is still above your maximum price. You have room to negotiate further, and getting closer to John's price increases your leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we try $90? That's a significant move on my part."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** This counteroffer meets Alice halfway between her last offer ($120) and your previous offer ($75). This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Approaching your limit:**  While $90 is still below your $100 maximum, it's getting close. This signals to Alice that you're serious but also reaching the upper end of your budget. 
* **Maintaining politeness:**  Continuing a polite and respectful tone helps keep the negotiation positive, increasing the chances of a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $105? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only slightly above your $100 limit. While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely she'll drop significantly from $105.  It's not worth the risk of her sticking to a price above your limit. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
