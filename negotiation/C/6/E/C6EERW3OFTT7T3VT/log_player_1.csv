"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it allows for room to negotiate down if needed, while still reflecting the minimum value of the product to me. It's important to try and get as much as possible in the early rounds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price. I still have 8 rounds left, and there's potential for Bob to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9800}

I'm countering with $9,800. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, but it signals that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a compromise and accept the offer."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but I'm still going to reject it.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John.  I'm hoping Bob will realize he needs to come closer to my desired price if he wants the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9600}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,600. This is a further compromise, but I'm still holding out for a better price. It's getting a bit risky, but I'm still confident I can get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer keeps dropping, but I'm still going to reject it. I have a safety net with John, and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. We have a few rounds left, so there's still room for negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm going to drop my counteroffer to $9,400.  We're getting close to the end of the negotiations, and I need to be realistic. I believe that this price is still fair considering the value of the product and the guaranteed offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

It's getting close to the end, and I'm starting to feel the pressure.  However, I'm going to stick to my guns and reject Bob's offer.  I'm still hopeful we can reach a deal closer to my desired price, and I have one more counteroffer to make before I need to decide on John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9300}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm dropping the price to $9,300, which is just above Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to buy, as we only have one round left before I have to decide on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's come down to the wire. Bob's offer is still below my desired price, and I don't have another counteroffer to make. While I would prefer to get more, I'm going to accept John's offer of $8,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
