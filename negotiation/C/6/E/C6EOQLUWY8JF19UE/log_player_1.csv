I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate, and I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}

I'm countering with $12,500. This is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to come up a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still a bit too low for me.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to go that much lower than my minimum.  John's offer is right at my minimum, and I'm not sure I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll take the sure thing and sell to John."
