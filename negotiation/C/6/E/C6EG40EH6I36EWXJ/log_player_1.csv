Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:**  We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. Even if he gets you down a bit, you'll still be well above your minimum. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to accept."
