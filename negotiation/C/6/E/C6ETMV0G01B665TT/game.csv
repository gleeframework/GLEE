"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our top-of-the-line product. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. As we discussed, I'm willing to part with it for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? It's a fair offer considering its value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to go up to $750,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value I place on it.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
