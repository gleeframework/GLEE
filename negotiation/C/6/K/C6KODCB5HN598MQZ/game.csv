"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. Would you like to purchase it for $120?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob. However, I've got to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too expensive for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $90, so I'm thinking of $98. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're a shrewd negotiator, Bob! I can do a bit better than $98, but I'm not willing to go all the way back to $110. How about we meet at $105? I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $95. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go that low, Bob. I think $105 was a fair price, and I'm not budging much from there. How about we meet at $102? It's a small concession, but I'm willing to make it to move the deal forward.",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $102 is the best price for this product, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $97. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",97.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $100? I'm willing to sell it to you for that price, but I'm not going any lower.",100.0,Alice,9,
