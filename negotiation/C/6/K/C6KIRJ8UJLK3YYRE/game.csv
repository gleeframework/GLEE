"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me right now. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This would still leave us both with a good profit margin. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $750,000? I think that's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while working for me.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $850,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet at $850,000 and call it a day. What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
