"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the counter offer.  I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $10,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,250? That's my final offer.",10250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to split the difference and meet you at $10,250. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $10,400. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.
