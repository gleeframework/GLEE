Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiating."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 starting price:** This is a reasonable starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Open to negotiating:** This communicates flexibility and encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  A positive message is more likely to lead to a successful interaction and encourages Bob to consider the offer.

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:**  Starting high gives you the best chance of getting a good price.
* **Encourage negotiation:** By showing willingness to negotiate, you make Bob more likely to counteroffer.
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:**  If negotiations stall, you can always switch to John for your guaranteed $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $80 is your minimum acceptable price, I'm choosing to **RejectOffer** for these reasons:

* **Potential for a higher price:**  There's a chance Bob values the product more than $80.  By rejecting his offer, I open the door for further negotiation and potentially a better price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Accepting his offer immediately would signal that I'm desperate to sell. By rejecting, I show I'm not willing to settle for the minimum. 
* **Learning about Bob:** Seeing how much Bob is willing to increase his offer will give me more information about his perceived value of the product.

I'll proceed with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob!  I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $90 for you since you're so keen on the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm aiming for a compromise by offering a price that's halfway between my original offer and Bob's offer. 
* **Positive messaging:** I maintain a positive tone, thanking Bob for his interest and highlighting his enthusiasm. This helps build rapport.
* **Justification:** I provide a reason for my counteroffer: ""since you're so keen on the product."" This acknowledges Bob's interest without directly stating his offer was too low.
* **Flexibility:** I'm still open to negotiating, indicating that $90 is not my absolute bottom line. 

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:** It's a reasonable compromise that could lead to a quick agreement.
* **Signal confidence:** By not immediately accepting Bob's offer, I show confidence in the product's value.
* **Keep the negotiation going:** It encourages further discussion and gives me a chance to see if Bob is willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to **AcceptOffer** for these reasons:

* **Close to my minimum:** $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  There's a chance Bob might not budge further, and if he doesn't, I might end up selling to John for $80 anyway.
* **Time factor:**  Continuing the negotiation might drag on, and there's no guarantee of a better price.

While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale that's very close to my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a worse outcome."
