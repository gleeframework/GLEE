"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $175. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $125. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's value. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $150 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's meet in the middle.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $135 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $142.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us to both get a good deal. What do you think?",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $138. Let's see if we can reach a final agreement.",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a price we both agree on.  I'm willing to come down to $140. This is a final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to sell to someone else. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,7,
