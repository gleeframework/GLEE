"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. I believe it holds immense value for someone with your insights.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm willing to come down a bit to show I'm serious about getting this deal done. How about we settle at $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still outside my range.  I'm prepared to go as high as $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
