"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1200000, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $1,200,000, he can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer. There's a potential for significant savings if he can negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to consider a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the midpoint between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $975000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is aiming for the lowest possible price, and continuing to bargain could get him closer to his target. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to budge further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not ready to accept $925000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. I'm thinking of a price that's slightly above the midpoint. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950000. This is still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might become less willing to compromise and potentially lead to a stalemate. At $950,000, the deal still provides a significant saving for Bob compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable compromise and secures the product at a good price."
