"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $100. I'm hoping to get a price closer to my minimum of $150.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $150. I want to see if I can get closer to my target. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair price for such a great product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for it. Can we meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before selling to John. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to $145."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is a really great product, and I'm sure you won't regret it."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob or ending up with no sale."
