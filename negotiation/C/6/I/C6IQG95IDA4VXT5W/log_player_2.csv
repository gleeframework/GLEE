Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130.

While $130 is better than $150 from John, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You can make a counteroffer closer to your desired price of $105."
