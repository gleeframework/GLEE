"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,800,000 is a significant offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you be willing to consider $2,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer, but I'm still a bit far from that. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, at $2,050,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value, but I'm not willing to go any higher than that. What do you think?",2050000.0,Bob,4,
