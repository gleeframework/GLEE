Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This gives me a decent margin while hopefully still being attractive to Bob. I'll be prepared to negotiate if he counteroffers, but I'm not going to undervalue my product.  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum value for the product ($15,000).  I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, but I'm willing to negotiate further.  I want to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. This is still a good price for me, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price.  If he rejects again, I might start thinking about selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, it's better to take the $15,000 than risk losing the sale completely.  It's also a good sign that Bob seems serious about buying the product."
