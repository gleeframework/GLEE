{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial valuation, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob knows his maximum budget is $8,000. This is a bold counteroffer, but it establishes his firm limit and leaves room for negotiation."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still outside of Bob's budget. Bob should continue negotiating to try and get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much money as possible. This counteroffer is a middle ground between his initial offer and Alice's most recent one. It shows he's willing to compromise but is still firm on his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is getting closer to Bob's budget, he's still only 5 rounds in, and there's a good chance he can negotiate a lower price. He's already rejected a price higher than this, so he should hold out for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget but still wants to save as much as possible.  A counteroffer of $9,500 is a reasonable compromise, showing a willingness to meet halfway while still staying within a range he's comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is now offering $10,000, which is still $2,000 more than Bob's target price and leaves him with only 3 rounds to negotiate.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000 and secure a deal within his budget.  While there's a chance he could negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of not getting a deal at all is too high, especially with limited rounds remaining."
