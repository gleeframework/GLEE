"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,500,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Your offer is very close to what I need to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,075,000?",1075000.0,Alice,5,
