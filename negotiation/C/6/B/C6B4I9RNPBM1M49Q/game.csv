"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,200,000 is fair. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair price considering its unique features and potential.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Would you consider that?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is getting close to my absolute bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to negotiate.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced $1,025,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider that?",975000.0,Bob,6,
