Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair price considering its unique features and potential."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. Would you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer. Bob is clearly interested and negotiating. Let's see if we can push him a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $950,000 is getting close to my absolute bottom line.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,025,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your willingness to negotiate."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not convinced $1,025,000 is the right price. I'm willing to pay $975,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for more, Bob is clearly engaged and negotiating in good faith. Accepting $975,000 is a significant profit above John's offer, and the risk of losing the deal by continuing to negotiate isn't worth the potential upside at this point."
