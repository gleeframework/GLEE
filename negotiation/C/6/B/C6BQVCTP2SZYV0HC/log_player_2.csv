"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is less than what you're willing to pay, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my desired price, it's still higher than I'd like to go. I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price again."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your perspective and your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to us both, I'm willing to come down slightly.  My final offer is $1,190,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,190,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is $1,190,000, which is still within my budget and only slightly more than my last counteroffer.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will simply stop negotiating and I'll be forced to buy from John for a much higher price. Accepting this offer is the most prudent decision."
