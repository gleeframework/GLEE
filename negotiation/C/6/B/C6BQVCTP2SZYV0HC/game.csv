"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000?",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair price, given the value of the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective and your willingness to negotiate.  To be fair to us both, I'm willing to come down slightly.  My final offer is $1,190,000.  This reflects the true value of the product. Let me know if this works for you.",1190000.0,Alice,5,
