Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a good starting point as it:

* **Provides you with a significant profit:** You're earning $3,000 more than your minimum price.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There is still $2,000 of potential value for Bob, which encourages him to negotiate.

By setting this price, you are showing Bob that you are serious about getting a good price, but you are also open to finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price point.  I will counter with a higher price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable deal before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm increasing the price slightly, but still showing flexibility.  I'm confident that Bob sees the value in the product and will be willing to meet me halfway.  Let's see if this counteroffer is successful!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate a bit more.  I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than John. I'll send another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering a compromise price that's still higher than Bob's last offer.  I think this demonstrates my willingness to reach a deal, while also ensuring I get a price closer to my target. Let's see if this convinces Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there yet. I've had several rounds of negotiations, and I'm concerned that pushing further will risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting this offer ensures I earn more than selling to John, and it's a good outcome given the back-and-forth negotiations."
