"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,200,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe he'll likely counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still above Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair compromise that gives us both room to negotiate further.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement within the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $975,000.  This is a smaller decrease than my last offer, showing that I'm getting closer to a point where I'm willing to accept. However, it's still above Bob's current offer, demonstrating that I'm not desperate to sell and still believe the product is worth more. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out hope for a better price.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not feeling pressured to accept Bob's offer just yet.  I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is a significant decrease from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. It's also a fair price for both of us, considering the remaining rounds and the fact that I can sell to John for $1,000,000. With only 3 rounds left, I need to find a price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.  We're down to the final two rounds, and while I can still counteroffer to Bob, it's getting increasingly unlikely that we'll reach an agreement that satisfies both of us. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, which is a much more reliable outcome."
