Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth more than $800,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $950,000 is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob.  It also subtly reminds him that he might lose out if he doesn't take the deal. 

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation and potentially securing a sale with Bob."
