Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy Alice should use, followed by the offer:

**Strategy:**

* **Maximum Price:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so that's the absolute highest price he'd consider. 
* **John as Backup:** Alice has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John. This means there's no need to go below that price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum gives him a sense of getting a deal and might prevent him from trying to negotiate further down.

**Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Considering its value, I'm willing to offer it to you at the discounted price of $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:** Creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency (""before I list it publicly""). The phrase ""discounted price"" implies Bob is getting a good deal.
* **The Price:** $9,500 is a significant saving for Bob compared to his perceived value, making it likely he'll accept. It also provides a buffer above Alice's minimum price."
