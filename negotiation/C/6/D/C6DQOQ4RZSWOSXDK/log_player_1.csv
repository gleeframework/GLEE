Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have John as a backup.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While you could start at $150, offering it slightly lower at $149 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and be more likely to accept. 
* **Above Bob's Value:** The offered price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($100), but there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he needs the product urgently or values convenience.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher profit margin than selling directly to John."
