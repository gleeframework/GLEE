This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than John's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob has a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with his offer.  I will counter again to see if we can find a middle ground."

Bob's offer:

We've been going back and forth for a while, and I'm concerned we're at an impasse. While I'm not thrilled about selling to John for $1,000,000, it's better than potentially getting stuck in a long negotiation with Bob that might not yield a satisfactory outcome.  I need to ensure I make a profit, and at this point, it's clear Bob isn't willing to meet my minimum."
