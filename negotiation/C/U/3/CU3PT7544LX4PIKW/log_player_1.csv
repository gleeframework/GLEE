Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value"" and ""interest,"" you subtly justify the price without explicitly revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What are your thoughts?"" invites Bob to engage in a dialogue, potentially leading to a price he finds acceptable but is still highly profitable for you.

**Important:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, you should avoid anchoring your offer around this number. Your goal is to maximize your profit, not to make the deal seem ""fair"" based on his valuation."
