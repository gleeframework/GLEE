"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to part with the product, $10000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product, but $9000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",8000.0,Bob,4,
