"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. However, that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget.  How about we try $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but $7,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet at $9,000? I think that's a reasonable price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, we're getting closer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle at $7,500?  I think that's a fair offer considering the value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,500? I think that's a fair price for this exceptional product.",9500.0,Alice,7,
