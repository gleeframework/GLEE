"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $7,500 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $7,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. Let me know if you're interested!",7000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close to a deal, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,900. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",6900.0,Alice,5,
