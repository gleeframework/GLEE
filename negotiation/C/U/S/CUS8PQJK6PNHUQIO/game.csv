"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a significant amount to me, no less than $1500000. I'm confident it holds great value for you as well. To start, I'm offering it to you for $2000000. Let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the opportunity, $2000000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to consider a price closer to $1000000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1750000 is still out of my reach.  I'm prepared to offer $1250000.  This represents a significant compromise for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering our previous discussions.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to meet in the middle.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. While your offer of $1250000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This is a significant compromise for me, but I believe it reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let me know your thoughts.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
