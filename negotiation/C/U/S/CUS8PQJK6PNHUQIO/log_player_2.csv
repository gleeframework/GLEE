**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer the product for $1750000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for some room for negotiation. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I hope we can reach an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,750,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation. I'll try to counter with a lower price again, hoping to find a compromise."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your commitment to finding a solution. While your offer of $1250000 is closer to what I need, it's still a bit below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,600,000 is still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. While we've made some progress, it's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually agreeable price. I'd rather buy from John for $1,000,000 and avoid further negotiation."
