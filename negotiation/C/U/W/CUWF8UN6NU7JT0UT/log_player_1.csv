Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to try to get the price even lower. Can you consider my offer?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, his offer is too low.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can reach a middle ground."
