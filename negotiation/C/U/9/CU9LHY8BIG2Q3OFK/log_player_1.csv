Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum price:** $9,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you'll still make a profit.
* **It's not too high:** $9,000 is still a reasonable price, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation. 

This strategy balances maximizing your profit with keeping the negotiation open. If Bob rejects, you can adjust your offer based on his counteroffer. You also have the safety net of selling to John for $8,000 if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While $7,500 is still a decent profit, it's not as good as I can potentially get. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. 

I have the option to sell to John for $8,000, but I want to see if I can do better with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $8,250 is exactly halfway between my minimum price of $8,000 and Bob's offer of $7,500. This shows a willingness to compromise while still achieving a decent profit. 
* **Positive messaging:**  The message emphasizes a ""great deal"" for Bob and a desire to ""make this happen"". This keeps the negotiation positive and encourages Bob to agree. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $8,250 is above my minimum, so I'm still getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $8000? That's fair to both of us and gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I would have liked to get a bit more, it's a fair deal and it avoids the risk of further negotiation.  It's also a quick and easy way to secure the sale.  

Selling to John for $8,000 would be the same outcome, but this way I avoid the hassle of going through John and get the product sold quickly."
