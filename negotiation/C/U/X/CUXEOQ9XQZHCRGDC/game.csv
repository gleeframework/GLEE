"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $2000000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is very generous, but unfortunately, it's significantly above my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't afford to pay that much.  I'm willing to offer $800000 for it, which is the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's see if we can make this work.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1200000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm counteroffering at $1000000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1000000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm going to stick with my offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. Let's work together to find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm counteroffering at $950000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $800000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, I understand that we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to get concerned that we might not be able to reach an agreement. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.
