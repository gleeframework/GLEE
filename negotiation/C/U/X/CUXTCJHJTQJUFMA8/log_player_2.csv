"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the potential value this product holds. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,150,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's a chance to get a better price. Alice mentioning another buyer could be a negotiating tactic, but it also indicates she's motivated to sell.  You might be able to get the product for closer to her $1,000,000 valuation by rejecting this initial offer."
