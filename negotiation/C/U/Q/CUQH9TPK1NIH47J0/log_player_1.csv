Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'm also aware that Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum value, so I believe there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, it's still significantly below my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum.  I want to show flexibility to Bob, but also ensure that I'm still getting a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now just $20 below my minimum. At this point, it's a good deal to accept, considering I'm confident I can sell it to John for a higher price if I need to. It's also a good way to test if Bob is willing to negotiate further in the future."
