"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product will bring you significant value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within Bob's budget:** $13,000 is still under Bob's maximum of $15,000.
* **Compromise is good:** Alice has moved from her original $14,000 to $13,000, showing a willingness to negotiate.  
* **Potential for further savings is low:**  Bob already offered $12,000 and Alice rejected it. Further counteroffers might lead to more rounds of negotiation without a guarantee of a lower price.

Accepting the offer secures the product at a good price within Bob's budget and avoids potentially drawn-out negotiations."
