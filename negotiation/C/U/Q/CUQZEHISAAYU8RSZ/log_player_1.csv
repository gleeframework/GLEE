{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($8,000), but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive and direct:** My message is friendly and straightforward, directly stating the price and encouraging Bob to respond.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects the offer, I will analyze his counteroffer and consider if it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price.
* If his counteroffer is too low, I will make a counteroffer of my own, trying to reach a compromise.
* If negotiations stall, I will not hesitate to sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is willing to pay a premium, $9,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's room for negotiation, as Bob has shown willingness to pay more than his initial value assessment.
* **Gaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer gives me leverage in the next round. By rejecting, I demonstrate my commitment to a higher price, potentially pushing him closer to my desired range.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will send a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point, but still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll aim for a compromise that's mutually beneficial.
* **If no agreement:** If further negotiations fail to yield a satisfactory price, I will proceed with selling the product to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $9,000 is a good starting point,  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to make this deal work. This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $11,000 splits the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining value:**  $11,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial assessment of $8,000, indicating the product's value and justifying my position.
* **Staying above minimum:** I am staying above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Encouraging acceptance:** My message is friendly and encouraging, focusing on the benefits of a deal for both parties. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** The deal is finalized, and I successfully sell the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I will analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's close enough to my minimum acceptable price. If not, I will make a final counteroffer before selling to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Too far from my minimum:** While Bob is inching closer, $10,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Room for improvement:** There's still room to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a higher price. 
* **Maintaining my position:** Rejecting his offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell at a low price and that I'm willing to walk away if a fair deal isn't reached. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will send a counteroffer closer to my desired price, aiming for a final compromise.  I might propose a price between $10,500 and my previous offer of $11,000. 
* **If no agreement:** If the next round of negotiation doesn't result in a satisfactory price, I will sell to John for $15,000."
