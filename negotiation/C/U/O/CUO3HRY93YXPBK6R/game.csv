"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer for the product, but I think $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8000. What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10500 for this exceptional product. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to achieve my minimum desired price. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8000, which would be $9000. Can we discuss this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
