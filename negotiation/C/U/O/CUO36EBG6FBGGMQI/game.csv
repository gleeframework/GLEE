"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11,250. I'm willing to give you a slight discount from my initial offer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
