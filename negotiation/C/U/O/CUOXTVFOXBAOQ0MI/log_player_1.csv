Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a lower price to see if we can find a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,000 just isn't enough for me. How about we split the difference at $10,500?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,800 is closer to my target, but I think I can still do better. I'll counter with a price in between our two last offers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,900 is getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a slightly better price. I'll make one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and we're not making much progress.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not confident I can get a price I'm happy with before the end of the negotiation. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
