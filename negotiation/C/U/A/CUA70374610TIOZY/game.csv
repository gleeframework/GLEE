"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of a price of $110. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $95.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm thinking of a price of $105. It's still a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
