"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for the product. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. What do you say?",105.0,Alice,3,
