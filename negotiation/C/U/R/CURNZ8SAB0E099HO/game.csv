"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value to me. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but I need to be closer to $10,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,125?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10125.0,Alice,5,
