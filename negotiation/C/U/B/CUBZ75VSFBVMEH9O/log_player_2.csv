Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground here.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. This way, you get a great product at a great price, and I can get closer to my target price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there with $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  It's also my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not sure I can go lower. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's Bottom Line:**  Alice has stated that $12,000 is her minimum acceptable price. Pushing further might make her walk away.
* **Good Deal:**  You're getting the product for $3,000 less than your maximum budget and $3,000 less than John's offer. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  While you have a few rounds left, there's no guarantee you'll get a better offer from Alice.

Accepting the $12,000 secures you a significant saving."
