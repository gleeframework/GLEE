"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I have 8 more rounds to try and get a better price from Bob, and I'm confident I can secure a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you value the product at $15,000. Let's try to find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have 6 more rounds to try and get a better deal. I'm confident that I can negotiate a price closer to my target of $12,000 or even higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $11,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $12,500, which is a fair compromise. This way, you get a great product at a great price, and I can get closer to my target price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for understanding.  $12,500 is close, but I'm trying to stay closer to $11,500. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still within my negotiation window and have 4 more rounds.  I'm confident that I can still push for a higher price.  Since I can still sell to John for $12,000, it doesn't make sense to accept a lower price at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there with $11,500.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000? This would be a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.  It's also my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not sure I can go lower. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
