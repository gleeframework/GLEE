"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, allowing me to gain a decent profit while giving you a significant value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I see the value in your product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $600,000?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is far below my minimum asking price.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,000,000? This would still be a good deal for you, given the value you mentioned, and it would allow me to move closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,000,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but let's try $900,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing you to get a valuable product at a price that's still within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely she'll go below $800,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000. It's better to secure the deal with John now rather than risk further negotiation with Alice and potentially miss out on both options."
