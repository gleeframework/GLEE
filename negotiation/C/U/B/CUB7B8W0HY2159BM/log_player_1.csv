Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly if he desires.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** While we could start higher, a price too close to $12,000 might discourage Bob from even considering the offer.

This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price that significantly benefits Alice while still being attractive to Bob."
