"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However,  $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $925,000. This offer reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 925000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Can we discuss this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we still have room to negotiate. Accepting $875,000 would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We're in Round 4 with 6 rounds remaining, so we have time to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  How about $900,000? This reflects the value it brings while recognizing your initial offer."", ""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** This counter-offer splits the difference between Bob's last offer ($875,000) and our previous ask ($925,000).  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a strong profit.
* **Time consideration:**  We're in Round 5, so we have time, but we don't want to drag this out unnecessarily. This offer encourages a quicker resolution. 
* **Alternative in mind:** We always have the safety net of John's offer ($800,000), so we won't accept anything below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong profit:**  While not our ideal target, $880,000 is a substantial profit margin above our minimum ($800,000). 
* **Bob's limit:** Bob has indicated this is his final offer. Pushing further risks losing the deal entirely.
* **Time remaining:**  We have four rounds left, but there's no guarantee of securing a better offer from Bob. Accepting now mitigates the risk of negotiations stalling."
