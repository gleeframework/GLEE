"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I'm open to negotiation, $900,000 is a little low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $950,000.  This would still give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider my counteroffer?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your counteroffer.  However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $940,000, which is a significant concession.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal!",940000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $940,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $930,000, but no higher. Can you consider my counteroffer?",930000.0,Bob,6,
