"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth the same to both Alice and John, there's no benefit to buying from Alice. You can get the product for the same price from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best option."
