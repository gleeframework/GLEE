Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's slightly above the value he places on the product, giving him some room to negotiate. I'm hoping to maximize my profit while still being open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's tempting to take the quick deal,  $90 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering a counteroffer of $110 to Bob. This is a compromise, moving closer to his offer but still above my minimum threshold. I'm hoping this price point is attractive enough for Bob while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $105. While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise and exceeds my minimum threshold of $100.  It's also slightly more than I would get from selling to John.  I'm happy to close the deal with Bob."
