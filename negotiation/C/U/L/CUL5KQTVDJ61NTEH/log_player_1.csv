Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  Offering $10,000 sets a high anchor point for the negotiation. It's important to remember that I need to get at least $8,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **Open to negotiation:**  The message indicates flexibility, encouraging Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially increasing the likelihood of a deal.
* **John as a fallback:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $8,000 provides a safety net. If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $7,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I'm willing to negotiate, but I believe there's a chance I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **John as a safety net:**  If the negotiation with Bob fails, I can always sell to John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  That's a good price, considering the value of this product.  Let's try to make this work!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer of $8,500 splits the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my price. This might encourage Bob to reconsider.
* **Positive tone:**  The message remains positive, aiming to keep the negotiation going.

**Important:** I'm still comfortable with selling to John for $8,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $7,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:**  Accepting Bob's offer now might lead him to believe he can keep pushing the price down in future rounds.
* **John provides a better deal:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is a safer option, as it guarantees my minimum desired price.

I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm aware that I'm risking the possibility of getting a lower price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm firm on $8,000 though. This product is truly unique and worth every penny.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:** I'm sticking to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This shows Bob I'm serious about my value assessment.
* **Highlighting Uniqueness:**  Reminding Bob of the product's unique qualities reinforces its value.
* **Open to compromise:**  The message still suggests a willingness to find common ground, leaving a small window for further negotiation.

**Important:**  While I'm open to one final counteroffer from Bob, I'm ready to sell to John if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not convinced that $8000 is a good price for this product. I'm willing to pay $7200. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is pushing too low:**  Bob's offer of $7,200 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **No room for further negotiation:**  I've already made several concessions. There's a high risk that Bob will continue to push the price down if I counteroffer again.
* **John's offer is secure:**  John is a guaranteed buyer for $8,000.  This is a better deal than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price.

It's time to cut my losses and sell to John, ensuring I get my minimum desired price."
