"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, while ensuring I can cover my costs. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!",10000.0,Alice,5,
