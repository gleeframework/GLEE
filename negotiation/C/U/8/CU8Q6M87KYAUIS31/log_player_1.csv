"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also setting a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd rather sell to Bob than John, I need to be sure to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This still leaves room for you to get a great deal, while ensuring I can cover my costs. "", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $10,500 is closer, but I'm aiming for something under $10,000.  Would you be willing to do $9,500? I'm ready to close the deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, Bob's offer is still below my desired range. I'll counter-offer again to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
