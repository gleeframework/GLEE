{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
It's not worth it to buy the product from Alice for $160.  It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

I'm offering $110, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe this is a fair price considering my maximum budget is $120."

Alice's offer is still too high. I will continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}

I'm offering $120, which is my maximum budget. I believe this is a fair price considering Alice's previous offer and the fact that John is also willing to sell it for this price."

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget. I'll continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

Alice has been coming down in price, and I want to test the waters with a slightly higher offer than my last one. I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet in the middle and accept this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice is still asking for more than my maximum budget, and I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed option with John at $120."
