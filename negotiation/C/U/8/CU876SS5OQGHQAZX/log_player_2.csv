"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget of $100. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  You can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $100.  This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay, and it leaves no room for negotiation on my end.  It's highly unlikely Alice will accept this offer, but it sets a clear starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $160 is closer to my budget, it's still above my comfort zone. It's worth trying to negotiate further. If I'm unsuccessful, I can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $100 to $120. This shows Alice I'm willing to negotiate but still keeping the price below her initial offer. This might encourage her to accept, as it's closer to her desired price. If she rejects again, I can always fall back on John's offer."
