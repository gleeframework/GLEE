Round 3

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I need to sell.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and your willingness to go with John if we can't agree. Let's try to close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, but this is my final offer.  I'm confident you'll find this a good value compared to buying from John.

Alice is not budging enough and is unlikely to come down to a price close to John's offer. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000."
