Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still within a reasonable range.  This allows for some negotiation room, and gives me a chance to see if Bob is seriously interested. I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's good that he's interested, I'm not willing to sell for that low of a price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll be happy with this product at that price."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $120. How about $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk lowering my price too much and ending up with a deal that's not profitable for me.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it's best to go with the sure thing and sell to him."
