"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for your specific needs."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We're aiming for the best possible price, significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while anchoring the discussion around a high number. 
* **Justification:** We're not just throwing out a number; we're emphasizing the ""unique value proposition"" to subtly justify the high price, even if this value isn't objectively clear.
* **Future Rounds:** This first offer sets the stage for a negotiation. We'll gauge Bob's reaction and adjust our strategy based on his counteroffers and how many rounds remain. We always have the safety net of John's offer if negotiations go poorly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value, indicating room for negotiation. Accepting $1,000,000 now would be leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. We still have ample rounds and the fallback option of selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While that offer is still quite a bit below my initial assessment, I'm willing to move down to $1,800,000. I believe this price point better reflects the long-term value and potential this product holds."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial decrease from our initial offer to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to engage further. 
* **Holding Firm (for now):** However, we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum price, aiming to maximize our potential profit. 
* **Value Emphasis:** We're continuing to subtly highlight the product's ""long-term value and potential"" as justification for the price, even without concrete specifics.
* **Future Rounds:** We'll continue to analyze Bob's responses and adapt our strategy in subsequent rounds. The goal is to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob and getting the highest possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down, but the gap is still too wide for me.  I can do $1,200,000 if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate. He's jumped $200,000 from his previous offer, showing he's willing to pay more. We have time to try and close that gap further before considering accepting his offer or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a significant investment on my end, but I believe in the value this product will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Move:** We're getting closer to our absolute minimum price but still holding a slight margin above John's offer to allow for potential negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is a ""significant investment"" for us, we're subtly introducing a sense of urgency and the possibility that we might walk away if the offer isn't met.
* **Final Stretch:** The remaining rounds will be critical. We'll need to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to our price and be prepared to accept a slightly lower offer or walk away to John's deal if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me too.  I'm getting closer to my limit, but I could go up to $1,300,000 to get this deal done.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. While Bob is getting closer to our minimum acceptable price, we're still significantly above it. His language suggests he might be willing to go higher, particularly the phrases ""getting closer to my limit"" and ""to get this deal done."" We'll use the remaining rounds to try and push him further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close. I want to see this deal through too. Let's make this final push easier - $1,425,000, and we have a deal."",
""product_price"": 1425000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're meeting Bob halfway between his last offer and our previous counteroffer, signaling strong willingness to close the deal.
* **Finality:**  The language ""final push"" and ""we have a deal""  implies this is our best and final offer, adding a layer of urgency.
* **Calculated Risk:**  We're still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value and leaving a small buffer above our guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only a few rounds left, we need to balance extracting the most value from Bob while avoiding the risk of him walking away entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is really my final offer.  If we can make it work at $1,350,000 I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Constraint:**  We are running out of rounds, and there is no guarantee Bob will go any higher.
* **Profitable Deal:**  While not ideal, $1,350,000 is still a significant profit margin above both our minimum and Bob's perceived value.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob is using classic negotiation tactics to pressure us.  While we might squeeze out a bit more, the risk of losing him entirely is too high. 

It's better to secure a very good deal now than to risk losing the sale and settling for John's offer."
