"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price of $13,500. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,500 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,000? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. While $14,000 is better than $15,000 from John, there's still room for negotiation.  He has 7 more rounds to try and get closer to his target. Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiations going and potentially allows for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500. I'm very interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, but I need to make a bit more than $13,500. How about $14,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the best possible price. Although $14,250 is closer to his ideal price, he has 5 rounds left.  By rejecting Alice's offer, he can try to get a lower price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and you would still get a good price."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. How about $14,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has only 3 rounds left and is getting closer to his ideal price point. While $14,000 is still higher than his initial target, it's a good deal considering the ""extras"" that Alice is offering.  

This is a strategic move to secure a good deal while minimizing the risk of running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price."
