"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in this product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we split the difference and I pay $13,000? ",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $14,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love the product!",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $13,500. I'm very interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway from $14,000, but I need to make a bit more than $13,500. How about $14,250?",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,250 is still a little above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,750, which is a fair compromise for both of us. This would allow me to move forward with the purchase, and you would still get a good price.",13750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. How about $14,000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",14000.0,Alice,7,
