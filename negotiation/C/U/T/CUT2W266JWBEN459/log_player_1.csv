Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $130, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and offers the product at a price slightly below what Bob is willing to pay.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still securing a good profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value and would like to propose a price of $120. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While $120 is still a good price, Alice can likely get closer to her desired price point by continuing the negotiation.  She knows Bob values the product at $150 and is willing to negotiate, so there's room to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $125? This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering our previous discussions, I believe a fair price for the product would be $115. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Alice would prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $115 is still a decent profit for her.  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price, and potentially ending up with the lower offer from John.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good sale and secures a profit."
