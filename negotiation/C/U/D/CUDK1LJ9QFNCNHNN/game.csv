,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for us both. While $80 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need for this product.  What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",100.0,Bob,4,
