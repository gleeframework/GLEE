Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $975,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the product's value significantly exceeds $750,000. I've already come down in price, and I need you to meet me closer to my position. I'm willing to consider $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is holding firm on a price significantly higher than John's offer. She's stated this is her final offer, making further negotiation unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at the known, acceptable price of $800,000."
