"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $975,000? I believe this price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your initial offer.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. However, $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $750,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the product's value significantly exceeds $750,000. I've already come down in price, and I need you to meet me closer to my position. I'm willing to consider $900,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's potential.",900000.0,Alice,5,
