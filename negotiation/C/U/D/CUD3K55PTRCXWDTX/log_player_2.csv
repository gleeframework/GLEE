"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to you, and Alice is offering it for $120.  This is a good price, but you can likely do better. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're keen on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it brings, and it leaves me some room to make this worthwhile for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good deal for you considering the product is worth $150 to you.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she might reject your counteroffer and you'd be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's better to secure the product now at a reasonable price."
