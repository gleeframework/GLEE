Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) but significantly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob ($150). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Friendly approach:** Using a friendly tone and mentioning Bob's potential interest in the product makes the negotiation feel less adversarial. 
* **Open-ended question:**  Ending with ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** While $100 is a decent price, it's still below my desired range. I'm aiming for at least $110 to make it worthwhile. 
* **Negotiation space:** Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open and allows me to try and get closer to my desired price. 
* **John's offer:**  While John's offer is a safety net, I believe I can get a better price from Bob, especially since he's already shown interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I see you're keen on this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $110.  That's still a good deal for you, considering the value it brings, and it leaves me some room to make this worthwhile for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product brings to Bob, making it more appealing to him.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While $110 is closer to my target, it still allows for some negotiation space if Bob is still hesitant. 
* **Open-ended question:** I'm keeping the conversation open and inviting Bob to respond to my offer."
