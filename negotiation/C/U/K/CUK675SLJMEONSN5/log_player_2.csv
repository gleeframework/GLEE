"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $25,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $25,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $25,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $15,000.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $25,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $15,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $15000 is lower than my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $20000? It's a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $20,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's target price of $15,000.  He should continue negotiating to try and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $20,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $17,500?  I believe this is a fair compromise that would benefit both of us."", ""product_price"": 17500}
