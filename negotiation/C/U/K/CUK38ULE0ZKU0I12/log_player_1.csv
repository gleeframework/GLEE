Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly below my minimum ($150) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($100). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""quality,"" I'm subtly implying the product is worth more than Bob might think.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in the conversation, potentially leading to a deal.

**Important Note:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $150, aiming slightly higher with Bob might lead to an even better outcome. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on selling to John."
