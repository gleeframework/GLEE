"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to keep your spending within a budget, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product.",140.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $120, but I'm still a bit below my minimum price. How about we bump it up to $145? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and my original price of $180.",145.0,Alice,5,,

"Hello Alice, I've considered your proposal and would like to suggest a price of $135. This is higher than my initial offer but still within my budget. I hope this meets somewhere in the middle for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me at $135. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm not quite there yet. How about we meet at $155? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",155.0,Alice,7,,
