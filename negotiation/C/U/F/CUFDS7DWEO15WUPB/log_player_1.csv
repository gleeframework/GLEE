{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point.  It's above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the deal as a good value for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
