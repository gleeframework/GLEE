"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to try to get a better deal. Can you consider my offer?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,500 is still too low for me. How about $13,500?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $13,500 is still a bit above my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there yet with $13,000. How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the deal.",13250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you're trying to stay within your budget, but $12,750 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, how about $13,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle again, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $12,900, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",12900.0,Bob,8,
