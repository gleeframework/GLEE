"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible, and there's room for both parties to find a compromise.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting the negotiation with a bold counteroffer, offering significantly less than Alice's initial price. This establishes a clear starting point for negotiation.  This offer is still within Bob's budget and gives him a good starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $1,100,000, which is still within Bob's budget.  While he could continue negotiating, the potential for a lower price is diminishing.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves $100,000 compared to buying from John.  This decision balances the desire to save money with the risk of continuing negotiations and potentially losing out on the deal altogether."
