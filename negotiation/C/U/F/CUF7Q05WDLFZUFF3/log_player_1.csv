"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price in the next rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $97.50 is closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a better deal. I'm not yet at a point where I'm willing to sell to John for $120, so I'm going to try to get closer to my goal with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm confident that you'll find this product a valuable addition."", ""product_price"": 100}
