"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'll find it really useful. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make this deal work.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105. How about $97.50?,97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $97.50 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute minimum.  I'm confident that you'll find this product a valuable addition.",100.0,Alice,5,
