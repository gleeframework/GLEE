"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your decision. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still above your maximum budget and what you could get it for from John. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price without completely walking away from the deal."
