"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I can only go up to $1,250,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
