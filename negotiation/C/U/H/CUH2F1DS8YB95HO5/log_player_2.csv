{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  I'm aiming for a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price, making it likely she'll consider it."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but I can still try to get a better deal.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and gives me a chance to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a good deal.  $1,350,000 is a compromise that might be acceptable to her, especially as it's still below her initial offer."
