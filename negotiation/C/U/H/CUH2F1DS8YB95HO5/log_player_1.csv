Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, leaving room for negotiation. It's also below Bob's estimated value of $1,500,000, making it a potentially attractive deal for him. 

This strategy aims to find a price that maximizes your profit while remaining appealing enough to avoid a quick rejection from Bob. Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I will counteroffer and try to find a price that is more favorable to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and this counteroffer demonstrates my willingness to compromise while also ensuring I get a better price than selling to John.  Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is a good compromise. While it's not as high as I initially hoped, it's still significantly better than selling to John for $1,200,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal to avoid further rounds of negotiation that might not yield a higher price."
