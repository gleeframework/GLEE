"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little lower than the middle ground, but still leaves me with a good profit.  I'm also trying to establish a friendly tone to hopefully encourage Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $100 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for something closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5} 
```

I'm offering a counteroffer that is closer to the middle ground. I'm also trying to emphasize that I'm flexible and want to find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and  above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better price."
