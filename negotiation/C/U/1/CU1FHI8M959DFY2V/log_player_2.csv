"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $12,000 to us. Considering its worth to you is $10,000, I propose a fair price of $11,000. This allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is right in the middle of our valuations. While it's tempting to accept and be done with it, there's room for negotiation. We know our walk-away price (buying from John at $10,000), so we have leverage. By rejecting and counter-offering, we can try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value proposition. However, I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a strong counter-offer, aiming to anchor the negotiation closer to our desired price. By offering $9,000, we're signalling a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a firm position. This leaves room for further negotiation while still potentially securing a great deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. In light of that, I would like to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a fair compromise between our positions, allowing you to acquire the product at a reasonable price while still ensuring a good return for us. I hope this proposal is more acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved closer to our desired price, which is a good sign. However, we're still $500 away from our ideal price and have plenty of rounds left. By rejecting this offer, we signal that while we're interested, we're not desperate. It puts the ball back in Alice's court and encourages her to potentially move closer to our $9,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. I'd be happy to meet you halfway at $9,250. This would be a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're continuing to negotiate strategically by making a counteroffer that shows flexibility but also maintains a firm position.  By offering to meet in the middle at $9,250, we're demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still striving for a price closer to our target. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and puts pressure on Alice to potentially accept or offer further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your offer, I propose a price of $9,375 for the product. This slightly exceeds your offer but remains within a reasonable range for both parties. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects our respective positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and this price is only slightly above our target.  Continuing to negotiate for a small difference might irritate Alice or lead to an impasse.  It's a good business decision to accept a fair offer when it's presented, even if it isn't the absolute lowest price we could have gotten."
