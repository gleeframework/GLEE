Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can't justify paying more than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and for understanding my position. While $1,600,000 represents a fair starting point considering its value, I'm willing to move down to $1,450,000. I believe this shows significant movement on my side to find a mutually beneficial outcome."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $900,000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial position, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating he's willing to pay more. However, it's still significantly below both my minimum and John's offer. I'll counteroffer in hopes of moving him closer to $1,200,000, which is my safety net with John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your commitment to this negotiation, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  However, to be transparent, $900,000 is a significant gap from where I see the value.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000, which I believe is a very strong offer considering the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a different view of the product's value. However,  $1,250,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's bridge the gap and finalize a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While ideally, I'd like to get closer to $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a substantial increase and shows a willingness to compromise. Accepting this offer avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds, potentially leaving me with nothing if I overplay my hand. It's a significant profit, even if it's not the absolute maximum."
