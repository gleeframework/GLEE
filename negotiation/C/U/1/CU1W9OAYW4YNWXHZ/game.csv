"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To start, I'm willing to offer $850000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet somewhere in the middle. I'm willing to lower the price to $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value the product holds for you, and it's a significant compromise on my end. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still too much for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This shows my commitment to reaching a deal but also reflects the value the product holds for me. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900000. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $950000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, while also being reasonable considering the value the product holds for you. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While $950000 is a better offer, it's still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $925000. This is a significant step from my last offer and demonstrates my good faith in finding a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's make this happen.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate and your willingness to go up to $925000. I'm willing to meet you at $930000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, while also being reasonable considering the value the product holds for you. I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to a deal, let's see if we can finalize it.",930000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $930000 is still slightly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer my final price of $910000.  This is a significant step from my previous offer and a price that reflects the value of the product to me. I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm not willing to go below $920000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product holds for you. I'm starting to feel that we're running out of time, and I'd like to reach a deal before considering other options. What are your thoughts?",920000.0,Alice,9,
