"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still leaving me some profit.  I'm aiming to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired value.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $14,000, acknowledging Bob's counteroffer but still leaving room for some profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, while also allowing me to secure a decent price."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $13,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not ready to accept.  I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not yet ready to sell to John.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13800}
```

I'm going to make a small concession by lowering my offer to $13,800. This is still a profitable deal for me and hopefully will be enticing enough for Bob to accept.  We're getting closer, and I want to see if we can reach an agreement in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is now above my initial minimum of $13,500, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get a better price, and I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a higher counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13700}
```

I'm going to make a small concession by lowering my offer to $13,700. This is a compromise to show Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but still allows me to get close to my desired price.  Time is running out, and I want to see if we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,650 is now very close to my desired price. We are running out of time, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John at a lower price.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
