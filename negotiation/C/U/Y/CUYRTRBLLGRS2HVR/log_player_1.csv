Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll really like.  I'm asking for $95 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your $80 minimum, maximizing your potential profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  At $95, Bob still gets a good deal, making him more likely to accept.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price up or down based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. How about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is still a good deal for you, as you value it at $100.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $70 is a bit low.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $77? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $77. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $77
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $77 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $80.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that we'll get stuck in a stalemate.  John offers a guaranteed $80, which is a safer and more profitable option at this point."
