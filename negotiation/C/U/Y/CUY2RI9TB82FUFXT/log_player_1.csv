Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I know it's valuable and worth it, but I'm willing to negotiate a bit if you're interested. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to maneuver and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By stating a willingness to negotiate, I signal to Bob that I'm flexible and open to finding a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Justification:**  While a simple price could be stated, hinting at the product's value and my potential flexibility aims to make Bob more receptive to the offer. 

Since Bob values the product at $150, there's a chance he might accept a price slightly higher, especially if he perceives the product as valuable and is unsure of my absolute bottom line."
