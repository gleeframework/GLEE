I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. This is to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $14,000.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."
