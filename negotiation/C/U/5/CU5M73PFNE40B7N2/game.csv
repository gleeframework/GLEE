"I'm interested in the product, but $90 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $82. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $75. I really like the product, but I need to be careful with my finances.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit tight on budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer it to you for $79. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",79.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $79. I'm willing to meet you at $78, and that's my final offer. I really want to buy this product, but I need to stick to my budget.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really close to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to go below $80. I think the product is worth it, and I'm not willing to sacrifice my profit margin. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'll offer it to you for $79.50. It's the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",79.5,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still not willing to go above $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time, but I need to stay within my budget. I'll offer $79.25. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $100.",79.25,Bob,8,
