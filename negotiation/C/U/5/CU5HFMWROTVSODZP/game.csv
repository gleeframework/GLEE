"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential ROI for you.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a fair offer that still allows you to reap substantial benefits.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down from $1,800,000 to $1,400,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,000,000, but I need you to come down further. I'm willing to offer $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  To show my commitment, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm getting close to my limit, so I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. I believe this is my final offer, as it represents a significant reduction on my end.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,100,000. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to consider buying from John at $1,000,000, so I'd like to see if we can meet at this price.",980000.0,Bob,8,
