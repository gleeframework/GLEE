Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find quite valuable. I think it would be worth $150 to you, and while I value it greatly, I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Value:** You know Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** Your minimum acceptable price is $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

Therefore, aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value maximizes your potential profit while leaving room for negotiation.  The offer of $130 gives Bob a perceived ""deal"" while still netting you a significant gain over your minimum."
