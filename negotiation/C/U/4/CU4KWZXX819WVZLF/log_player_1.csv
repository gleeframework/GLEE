Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you (which could weaken your position), the message implies it's worth a significant amount by mentioning  ""its value"". 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  The fact that you have another buyer (John) provides you with a strong fallback position. This allows you to be more confident in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You can always adjust your price downwards, but you can't go back up after a lower offer."
