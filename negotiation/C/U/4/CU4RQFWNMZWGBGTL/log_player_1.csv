Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price to gauge Bob's interest. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, but I want to see if I can get closer to $1 million. If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm not ready to sell for that amount yet. I believe I can potentially get closer to $1 million by continuing the negotiation and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be a more attractive price for Bob, but still allows me to earn a significant amount for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than what John is offering, and closer to what I believe the product is worth.  It's time to accept and close the deal."
