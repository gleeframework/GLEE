"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $100 is higher than $80, but not too far off. It gives Bob room to negotiate, but still keeps the deal profitable for you.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for less than $120, so it creates room for negotiation without you losing money.
* **It's a clear message:** You're stating your price and expressing confidence in the value of your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within $80. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is your minimum, it's important to remember that you have 10 rounds and the option to sell to John for $120.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to stick to my budget of $80. Is there any way we could meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is tempting, you're still within your goal of getting more than $80. Continue negotiating to see if you can get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your persistence.  $85 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? This is a good compromise, and we can close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
