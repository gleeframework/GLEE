"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit below my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which reflects the product's unique qualities. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I respect the value of the product, but I'm still unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose $1,050,000 as a counteroffer. I hope this is closer to what you're looking for.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, $1,050,000 still falls just short of what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, demonstrating my desire to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
