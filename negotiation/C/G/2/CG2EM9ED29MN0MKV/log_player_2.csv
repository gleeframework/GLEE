# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $12,500. This is a great deal for you, as you value it at $15,000. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer
