Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than your floor price:**  $14,000 is significantly more than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, so you're still making a good profit.
* **It's within Bob's budget:**  Bob values the product at $15,000, so he has room to pay $14,000 and still get a good deal. This increases the likelihood of him accepting. 

While you could try for a higher price, it's risky. Bob might reject the offer, leaving you with only John's lower offer of $10,000. This offer strikes a good balance between potential profit and securing a sale."
