"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I think you'll really appreciate its value, but I'm willing to make a deal with you. I'm offering it to you for $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay $15,000 for the product from John, accepting Alice's offer at the same price saves you the effort of going through another transaction.  There's no financial benefit to rejecting, as you'll end up paying the same price to John."
