"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. It's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think!",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $110 is unfortunately below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $125?  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $125 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. Can you meet me halfway again?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $115 is still too low for me.  I'm really hoping to get at least $120 for this product, and I'm willing to do $122.  It's a small difference, and I think it's fair considering how much I'm already coming down.",122.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $122. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $119. Can you consider that?",119.0,Bob,6,
