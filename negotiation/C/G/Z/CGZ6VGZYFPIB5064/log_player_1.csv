Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,500,000, and I'd like to discuss a lower price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the value while still being a significant investment on your end."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"

Bob's offer:

While Bob is engaged and getting closer to my minimum price, it's clear he's very focused on staying below $1,000,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John."
