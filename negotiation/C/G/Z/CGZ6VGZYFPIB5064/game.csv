"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,500,000, and I'd like to discuss a lower price. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the value this product brings is truly unique. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $800,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This reflects the value while still being a significant investment on your end.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to propose $900,000 as a more reasonable price. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair compromise while acknowledging the true value of what I'm offering.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but I really think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial price.",950000.0,Bob,6,
