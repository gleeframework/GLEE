"Alice, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $900,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a significant concession, but I want to see if we can finalize a deal. ",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a good compromise.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
