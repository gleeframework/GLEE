"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what I could get from another buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is still too high for him. He can get the product for $800,000 from John.  It makes sense to try to negotiate with Alice and see if he can get a lower price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a step in the right direction, $1,000,000 is still above his budget. He should counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to his $800,000 target."
