"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,200,000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but I believe the product's value to you is closer to $1,500,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget.  Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $1,100,000. I'm confident this price reflects the product's value to me while allowing you to get a fair return.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 accurately reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll come down to $1,175,000. This is my final concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you. What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,175,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise that considers both our needs.  Let's reach a deal that works for both of us.",1125000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'll come down to $1,200,000 was my first offer, and I've already come down to $1,175,000 and then $1,150,000, and now I'm at $1,175,000 again. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $1,150,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  To make this work, I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000.  With only a few rounds left, we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  This price is a fair compromise, and I believe we can close this deal.",1125000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're getting close to the end of our negotiation, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,125,000. I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle, and I'm concerned that we might not be able to come to an agreement. I'd like to propose a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $1,125,000, but I'd like to include a small bonus or warranty that will add value to the product.
