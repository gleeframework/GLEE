Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than the $15,000 value to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Maximizes your potential profit:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 

If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counteroffer or switch to John, keeping my goal of maximizing profit in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $12500. Would you be willing to come down to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is better than selling to John, it's still lower than my initial target.  I'll try to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? That's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13250}
