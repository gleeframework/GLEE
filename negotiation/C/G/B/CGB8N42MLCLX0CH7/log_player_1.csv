{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know it's worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum threshold. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price we're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although I'd like to continue negotiating with Bob, his latest offer of $85 is below my minimum threshold of $100.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
