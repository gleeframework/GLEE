"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $13,000. I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you.",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is way out of my budget. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for a product like this.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to be a bit flexible, how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I can do $7,000. That's a fair offer considering the market value.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about this. $7,000 is simply too low for what this product offers.  If I were to let it go for $9,000, that would be the absolute lowest I could go.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting close! I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and call it $8,500?  That's a firm offer from my side.",8500.0,Bob,6,
