"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects its worth while also leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we understand the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room:** We don't want to start too low and give away potential profit. A high opening allows Bob to counteroffer and still land within a range that benefits us.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message emphasizes a ""mutually beneficial agreement,"" setting a collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. How about we start the negotiation at $850,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is above our minimum, but it's significantly closer to our baseline than his perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows us to:

* **Demonstrate Value:** By not immediately accepting an offer above our minimum, we show Bob that we believe the product is worth more.
* **Maintain Negotiating Room:**  Accepting this early could set a precedent for the rest of the negotiation, limiting our potential gains. We have plenty of rounds to negotiate a better price. 
* **John as Backup:**  While selling to John is an option, it's our fallback. We should aim higher with Bob before settling for our minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is considerably higher than your proposal reflects.  To move forward, I could offer it for $1,050,000.  This feels like a fairer reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We lower our price by $50,000, showing willingness to negotiate but not drastically.
* **Justifying Value:** We re-emphasize the product's high value without directly criticizing Bob's offer. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** Our new price aims for a point closer to the middle ground between our initial offer and his counteroffer, encouraging him to move closer to our desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Would you consider $900,000? It's a significant investment and shows I'm serious about buying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is tempting, we're still early in the negotiation.  Bob's message suggests he has room to move. Let's continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price acknowledges your interest while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:** We make a more substantial move this round, dropping $50,000 to $1,000,000. This shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **""Meeting Halfway"" Tactic:** This framing makes our concession seem more substantial, even though it maintains a strong position above our minimum. 
* **Deadline Awareness:**  While we have rounds remaining, we want to guide the negotiation towards a close soon. This offer aims to either secure a deal or prompt a more serious counter from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this negotiation is important to both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $940,000 to find a solution. This is a strong offer, and I hope we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Testing the Waters:** Bob increased his offer by $40,000, a more significant jump than his previous $10,000 increment. This indicates he's willing to move closer to our price range.
* **Potential for More:**  We're still significantly above our minimum. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can close the gap even more. 
* **Time Cushion:** We have four rounds left, giving us some space to negotiate without risking losing the deal entirely to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  It seems we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to accept $975,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's value while meeting you closer to your budget."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** We reduce our ask by $25,000, a smaller concession than before but still demonstrating movement.
* **Fairness Framing:** By positioning this price as a ""fair compromise,"" we emphasize that we are both giving ground to reach an agreement.
* **Closing the Deal:** With three rounds remaining, this offer aims to finalize the negotiation. It's a strong price above our minimum, and Bob's counter-offers suggest he's willing to pay near this amount."
