At this point, Alice has come down significantly, and the price of $975,000 is a good deal compared to your alternative of buying from John for $1,200,000. While you might be able to negotiate Alice down a bit more, the potential savings are not likely to outweigh the risk of her increasing her price or the deal falling through."
