Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my target price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by offering $9,500. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to my minimum value."
