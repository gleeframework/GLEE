"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, and I believe it's a fair offer considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still a bit too far apart on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price that balances both our interests.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
