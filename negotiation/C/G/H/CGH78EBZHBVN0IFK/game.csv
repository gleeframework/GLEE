"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
