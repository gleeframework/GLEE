"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,500 is better than Alice's initial valuation of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $10,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $9,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,750 is closer to Bob's budget than Alice's previous offer, it's still above his limit. Bob should continue to negotiate to try and get a lower price.  Rejecting this offer allows him to make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,750 is still a little out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  Let me know if you're willing to accept."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll meet you at $9,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is the best price Alice has offered so far, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Since Alice has stated this is her final offer, further negotiation is unlikely to result in a lower price.  It's best for Bob to take the guaranteed deal with John, as he will save $1,500 compared to buying from Alice."
