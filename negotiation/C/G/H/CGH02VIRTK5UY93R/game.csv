Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its worth to you.,90.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $90 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77. It's a fair compromise considering its value to you.",77.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about $70? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $70. I think the product is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $75. It's a good compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that price.",75.0,Alice,5,
