Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with my absolute minimum price, hoping to entice Bob to negotiate. Since the product is worth more to me than to him, I'm setting the bar high. This will also give me more room to maneuver in any counteroffers.  If Bob doesn't accept, I'll gauge his interest and decide whether to counter or go to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'll counter Bob's offer. I'll try to find a middle ground, keeping in mind that I can always go to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $950,000.  This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I believe it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate, while still remaining within my desired range. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll consider selling to John or making a final, lower counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired range, it's still lower than I'd like. I'll counteroffer one more time, and if Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counteroffering at $925,000. This is my final offer, as I want to get as close as possible to my goal without risking losing the sale entirely. If Bob doesn't accept, I'll sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  While $910,000 is closer to my ideal price, I've reached my limit for negotiating.  I'm confident John will pay the full $1,000,000."
