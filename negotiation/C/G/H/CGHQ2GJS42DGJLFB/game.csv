"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little bit, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,500? This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,800 for the product. Can you consider that?",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make at least $9,200 to make this worthwhile. Let's meet in the middle at $9,200. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",9200.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $8,900 for the product. Can you consider that?",8900.0,Bob,6,
