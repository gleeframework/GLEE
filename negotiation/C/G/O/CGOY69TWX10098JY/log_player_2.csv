"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can likely get a better price than $11,000, as Alice is willing to sell for less than her own valuation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $10,500 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I accept $11,250?  This way, we both get a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is closer to your goal, you can still likely negotiate a better price.  You're willing to pay up to $10,500 and Alice is willing to sell for less than $12,000, so there's room for compromise."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 for this to work.  If you're serious about this deal, let's see if we can find a compromise at $11,000.   
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice is firm on her price of $11,000, which is still higher than what you're willing to pay.  It's better to cut your losses and go with John's offer of $10,000."
