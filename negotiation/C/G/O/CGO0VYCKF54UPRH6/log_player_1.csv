Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The offer is above my minimum threshold:** $15,000 is higher than my minimum value of $12,000, ensuring I make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** I'm not overpricing the product right away, giving Bob room to negotiate and potentially come to an agreement. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** The offer leaves space for potential negotiation, which can help maximize my earnings. 
* **Risk management:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product to John for $12,000, mitigating my risk.

By offering a price slightly above my minimum value, I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my potential profit and ensuring that Bob is likely to consider the offer."
