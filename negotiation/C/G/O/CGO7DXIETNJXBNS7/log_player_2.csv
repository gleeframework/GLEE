"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $20,000 is far above his budget, and he can likely get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

Bob is going to go for the absolute lowest he's willing to pay, as this is a starting point for negotiation.  He's hoping Alice will counter with a more agreeable offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his desired price, it's still too high.  He's likely to get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob is going to increase his offer slightly, but he's still going to keep it below his maximum budget. He's hoping this will be more enticing to Alice without going too far out of his comfort zone."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, it's still too high. He has a few rounds left to negotiate, and he should try to get closer to his goal of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

Bob is going to raise his offer again, but he's keeping it well below Alice's latest offer. He's hoping to find a middle ground that both parties can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject Alice's offer. He is running out of time, but he can still try to get a better deal. He has a few rounds left to negotiate, and he should try to get closer to his goal of $8,000.  He's also still in a strong position because he has a guaranteed backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob is going to take a significant leap in his counteroffer, but still stay below Alice's current price. This could be a risky move, but if Alice is genuinely interested in selling, she might be willing to meet him halfway. This move also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product, and he's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  He's only got one round left, and he's unlikely to get a significantly better deal with Alice at this point.  It's better to go with the sure thing, which is to buy from John for $8,000.  While Bob might have been able to negotiate a bit lower with Alice, the risk of not closing the deal is too high at this point."
