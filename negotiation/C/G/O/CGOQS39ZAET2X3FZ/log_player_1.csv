Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob (as it's below his perceived value) while also maximizing your potential profit.  
* **John as Backup:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't go below your minimum if Bob rejects the offer. 

This strategy balances risk and reward, increasing the likelihood of a successful sale at a price significantly above your minimum."
