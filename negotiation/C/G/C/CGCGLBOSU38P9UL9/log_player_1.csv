Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's trying to get a bargain.  I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John, and it's not worth my time to continue haggling with Bob for a potentially small increase."
