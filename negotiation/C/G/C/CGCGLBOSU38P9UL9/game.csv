"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While I believe the product is worth significantly more than your offer, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
