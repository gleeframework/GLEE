"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I know you've been looking for something like this and I believe it's worth at least $12,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's fair to both of us.  Let's talk about $10,000.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This means you'd save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's a good deal for you:**  Even though Alice values the product at $8,000, she's willing to sell it for $10,000. This means you're getting a good deal, but not a steal. 

**Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical decision to maximize your savings.**"
