"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is still quite high, and you have room to negotiate. It's better to start by rejecting and see if you can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the previous round, it's still a significant amount above what I'm willing to pay. I believe I can still negotiate a better price, and I'm not yet at the point where I'd be better off buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective positions. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to stick to your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $850,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is within my budget and closer to my target price. While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice may become less flexible and I might end up paying more. It's also possible that I won't have time to negotiate a better price in the remaining rounds, and I might be forced to buy from John for a higher price. 

Considering the risk of a stalemate or having to pay more, accepting this offer is the most logical choice at this point."
