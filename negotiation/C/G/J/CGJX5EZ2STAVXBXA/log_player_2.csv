"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, which is a fair price considering my budget. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is taking a bold stance by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. He is aiming to establish a starting point for negotiation that is closer to his target price. He also justifies his offer by stating that it is a fair price considering his budget, hoping to appeal to Alice's sense of reason."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is unfortunately not enough for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, and I'm offering the product for $850,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, but I'm open to further discussion. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's target price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. There are still several rounds left, and Bob is hoping to get the price closer to his desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000, which is my maximum budget. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my financial constraints. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering his absolute maximum price, aiming to meet Alice in the middle. He emphasizes the fairness of the offer, considering both the value of the product and his budget.  This is a strong negotiation tactic to try and secure a deal quickly."
