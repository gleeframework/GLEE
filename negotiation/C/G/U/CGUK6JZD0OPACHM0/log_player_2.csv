"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that will be immensely valuable to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000, reflecting its inherent worth and the potential it holds for your company's growth.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the significant value you'll realize. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs $800,000). This means there's room for negotiation.
* You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, so there's a range where both parties can benefit. 
* Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my expectations, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, reflecting the value of the product and the potential benefits it will bring to your operations. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than her stated value of $800,000. This indicates there's more room for negotiation.
* You are aiming to pay as little as possible and can still afford to pay more than Alice's value.
* Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially secure a better price, closer to your target."
