Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, at $1,800,000.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,600,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can push Bob further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,700,000. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has come up to $1,650,000, which is a good price considering he started at $1,600,000.  I'm not sure how much more I can get from him, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  I'll accept his offer and secure the sale."
