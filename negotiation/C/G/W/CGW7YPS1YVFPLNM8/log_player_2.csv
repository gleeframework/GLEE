Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment.
