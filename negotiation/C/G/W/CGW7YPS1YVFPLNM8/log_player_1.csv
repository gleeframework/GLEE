Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in your product, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $1,050,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit margin, and I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,050,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you be open to $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied. I want to see if I can push Bob further and get closer to my desired price point. I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I believe there's still potential to get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to get a great deal, and I respect that. But $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,012,500. It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you room for a good profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1012500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we split the difference between our last two offers and settle at $993,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This time, Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not enough.  I've already made several concessions and I'm running out of rounds. Rather than risk losing more money by continuing to negotiate, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's better than ending up with less."
