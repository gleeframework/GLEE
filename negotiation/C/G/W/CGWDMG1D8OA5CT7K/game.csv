"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I do like the product, $15,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $9,000. Would that work for you?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is too low for me.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will help you. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
