"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2000000. It's a unique opportunity and I believe it's well worth the investment. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's budget of $1,200,000. It's much better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in your product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to consider it. Would you be willing to negotiate?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1000000 is far below what this product is worth to me, I'm willing to compromise to find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1750000? This price reflects the unique value of the product, while still offering a substantial discount from my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,750,000 is still above Bob's budget. While it's a substantial decrease from her initial offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer will allow Bob to try and secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,750,000 is still out of my price range. I'm prepared to offer $1,350,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. This is my final offer, let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand this is a difficult negotiation. While $1350000 is still below my ideal price, I'm willing to make one last concession to close this deal. I'm offering you the product for $1500000, my absolute minimum. It's a price that reflects the value I place on the product while recognizing your financial limitations. Please consider this my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his target of $1,200,000. Bob has a strong bargaining position since he has a backup option with John. Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to potentially secure a better deal, especially since Alice has stated this is her final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, $1,500,000 is still above my maximum budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. It's a significant amount, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If this isn't acceptable, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
