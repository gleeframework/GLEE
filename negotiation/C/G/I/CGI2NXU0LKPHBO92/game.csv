"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  That's a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer: $9,500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000.",9500.0,Bob,6,
