"I'm interested in the product, but I think $2000000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1200000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This would still allow for a fair profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering the product's potential. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate your continued interest.  However, $1400000 is still significantly below what the product is worth. To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to drop my price to $1600000. This is a significant compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
