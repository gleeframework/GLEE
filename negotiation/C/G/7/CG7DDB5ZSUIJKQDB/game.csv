,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $6,000, which is $10,000. It's a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try $7,500? That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your seriousness, Bob, but $7,500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $7,500, which is $8,750. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $8,000. This is my final offer, as it's the maximum I'm willing to spend.",8000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $8,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum of $12,000. I'll give you a final offer of $11,500. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.",11500.0,Alice,7,
