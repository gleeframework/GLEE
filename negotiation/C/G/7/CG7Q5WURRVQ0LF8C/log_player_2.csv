"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $120 to start. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's way too high. Let's see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to pay much less than Alice's initial offer. Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer  ($60) gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be with her price. If she's open to a significant price drop, there's a good chance we can get a deal within our budget. 
* **Alternative Option:** We always have John's offer of $80 in our back pocket if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While $90 is better than her initial offer, it's still above our $80 maximum. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Alice moving from $120 to $90 suggests she's willing to negotiate.  We can likely get the price down further. 
* **John's Offer:** We're getting closer to John's price, but we should try to get the product from Alice for a better deal if possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a little low. I'm willing to move up to $70 to find a price we can both agree on. Do you think that would work?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're moving up from $60 to $70, showing Alice we're willing to negotiate but not going above our target.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer tests whether Alice is truly willing to meet closer to our budget or if she's firm on a price closer to $90.
* **Deadline Approaching:** We have a few rounds left, but it's good to start closing the gap now if we want to avoid resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than that. Would you be willing to do $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Quite:** $85 is very tempting, but we're still aiming to get as close to $80 as possible.
* **Final Push:**  Alice seems to be getting closer to our price range. We have a good chance of getting her to drop a little more. 
* **Backup Plan:** We're still happy to go with John's offer if needed, but it's worth one more try with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $75. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're happy with it."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** We're splitting the difference between our previous offer ($70) and her last offer ($85). This shows willingness to compromise but keeps us below our $80 limit.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By saying ""ready to close the deal,"" we add a bit of pressure without being aggressive. 
* **John's Offer:** We're still open to John's $80 offer if Alice completely rejects this one, but we've put ourselves in a strong position."
