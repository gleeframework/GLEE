"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $60 was a little low. I'm willing to move up to $70 to find a price we can both agree on. Do you think that would work?

You have three options:

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're getting closer! I could do $75. It's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're happy with it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $100. I have a guaranteed offer from John, and it's not worth risking losing that for a slightly higher potential profit from Bob."
