"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'll find very useful.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $100 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $100 is still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), so he has an incentive to accept.
* **It's a fair starting point:**  This avoids appearing too aggressive and sets the stage for a potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $90?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $80 and you've already made it clear you're willing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer secures a good profit and avoids the risk of further rounds potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at $80."
