"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth at least $1000000 to me, and I'm confident it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm open to negotiation, but my initial offer is $1500000.  Let me know what you think.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1250000 for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
