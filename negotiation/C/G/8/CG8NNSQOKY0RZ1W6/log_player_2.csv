"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm sure you'll agree it's a steal! What do you say, are you interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:** While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, Alice is clearly trying to get a significant profit margin. Her comment about the product's value to you is irrelevant to the negotiation.
* **You have a fallback option:** John offers the product for $1,500,000. This is your upper limit, but it provides leverage.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's first offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay.  There's a good chance Alice will come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale."
