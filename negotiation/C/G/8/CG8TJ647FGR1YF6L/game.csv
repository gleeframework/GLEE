"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm eager to make a deal and believe this price is fair.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, you've been very reasonable throughout this process, and I appreciate that. I'm ready to close the deal today, but I need to be at $7,800 to make it work. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll agree to the purchase right now.",7800.0,Bob,6,
