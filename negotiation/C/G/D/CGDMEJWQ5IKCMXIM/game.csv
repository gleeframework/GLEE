"Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $85? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but I'm still a bit short. How about $78? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $85.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your efforts. However, $78 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but how about $81? That's a fair compromise and I'm hoping we can close this deal.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit away from the price I'm comfortable with. How about $79? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $80 and $81.,79.0,Bob,6,
