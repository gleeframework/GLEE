"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $15,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and other similar products.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,500, which would be $12,750. Can you consider that?",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  I can tell you're interested and that this product would be valuable for you.  Let's settle this right now - how about $13,000 and we close the deal?",13000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to walking away, Alice. I really like the product, but I'm not willing to go above $12,500. That's my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll buy it from you.",12500.0,Bob,6,
