"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still potentially appealing to Bob. I'll see how he reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$100 is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. Hopefully, this will show Bob I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
