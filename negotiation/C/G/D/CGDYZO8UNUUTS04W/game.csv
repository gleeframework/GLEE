"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product is valuable to me,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price, considering your value for the product and the potential benefit to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
