"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but I need to counteroffer to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $12,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which is still a fair price given its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my maximum budget, but still leaves room for negotiation.  $8,500 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but it's a reasonable starting point for our negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $11,000, which is still a great value for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $11,000 is still significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'll continue to negotiate, trying to get her closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for continuing the discussion. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? This would still allow you a good profit and is within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant step towards Alice's price, demonstrating my seriousness about buying the product. It's still within my budget but allows for further negotiation if necessary.  I'm also highlighting the potential profit for Alice to incentivize her to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10,500, which is still a good profit for me, but also a fair compromise considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to lower her price, $10,500 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm getting close to my limit. I'll make a counteroffer, but if it's rejected, I may consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I truly appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price, and I believe we can close this deal.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

My counteroffer of $9,500 is a significant step closer to Alice's price, demonstrating my seriousness about closing the deal.  It's still within my budget, but it's a strong offer that leaves very little room for further negotiation. I'm hopeful that Alice will accept this offer. If she doesn't, I'm getting close to my limit and may consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is still $2,000 over my maximum budget.  While we've made significant progress in negotiations, I'm not confident that I can get her down to my desired price in the remaining rounds.  Given the time constraint, it's now more advantageous to buy the product from John at $8,000, ensuring I get a good deal and don't risk losing out entirely."
