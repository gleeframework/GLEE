"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $900,000 is still too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much as possible. While $850,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  He can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has a few things to consider here:

* **The price:** $825,000 is a significant savings compared to John's price of $1,200,000.
* **Alice's stance:** Alice seems firm on this price.  Further negotiation might not result in a lower offer, and could risk her walking away.
* **Time:**  There are still rounds left, but it's getting close to the end. 

While Bob could try to squeeze out a bit more, it's a good deal considering the alternatives. Accepting now is a reasonable choice."
