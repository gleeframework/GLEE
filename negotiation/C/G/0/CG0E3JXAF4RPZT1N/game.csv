"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to your business.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850,000 is still above my target. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good starting point for a final agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting close to your target, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $850,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
