Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I think this is a fair price."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** You have insider information that the product is worth $120 to Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** You want to maximize your profit, and selling it for $100 gives you a $20 profit over your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you could start higher, this offer leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit. 
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** Offering it at $120 or close to it risks Bob rejecting the offer, forcing you to sell to John for only $80. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale."
