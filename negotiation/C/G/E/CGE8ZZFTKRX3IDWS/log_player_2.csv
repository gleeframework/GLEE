"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our premium product. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save even more by counter-offering.  The goal is to save as much money as possible.  There's no harm in trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to spend less, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value of the product.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a significant saving for Bob compared to John's price of $800,000.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer again and forcing him to buy from John at a higher price is too high. It's a good compromise and a solid deal."
