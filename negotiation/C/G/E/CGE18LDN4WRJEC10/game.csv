"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $120. It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a discount. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, $95 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $105. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $98 for the product. Can you consider that?",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a few concessions already, Bob, and I'm getting close to my minimum price. However, I'm willing to make one more offer. I'll sell the product to you for $108. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make one more offer, but $108 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any higher.",100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've made multiple concessions, Bob, and I'm not willing to sell the product for $100. I'll sell it to you for $110, or I can sell it to someone else who is willing to pay the full value. The choice is yours.",110.0,Alice,9,
