"Alice, that's a great offer, but I'm unfortunately looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $7500 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8500?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that, and we can finalize the deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
