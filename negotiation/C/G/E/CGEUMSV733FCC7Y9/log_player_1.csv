Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 gives me some room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message clearly indicates a willingness to negotiate, inviting Bob to counter if he wants. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** A higher starting price gives me more leverage.
* **Keep Bob interested:**  The message encourages engagement and keeps the negotiation open. 
* **Maintain the option to sell to John:** I'm aware of my fallback option with John, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob's offers become too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a great offer, but I'm unfortunately looking to spend a bit less.  Would you be willing to accept $7500 for the product? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I have a guaranteed $8,000 from John. I'll try to push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $8,500?  That's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm not going all the way down to Bob's price, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise. $8,500 is a good middle ground.
* **Emphasize fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair price"" for both of us.
* **Reiterate my profit goal:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I need to make a profit, justifying my price.

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Keep the negotiation going:** I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further.
* **Increase my potential profit:** $8,500 is significantly better than my fallback price of $8,000.
* **Maintain leverage:** I haven't given in to Bob's initial low offer, which shows I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $8500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $8000, which is my absolute limit. Let me know if you're willing to accept that, and we can finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,000 meets my minimum price, and it's more advantageous than selling to John for the same amount.  While I could try to push for a higher price, there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.  Accepting this offer ensures I secure the sale and avoid the risk of a prolonged negotiation."
