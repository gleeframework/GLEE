"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to offer you $13,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your decision.",13000.0,Bob,4,
