"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a strong opening position that allows room for negotiation.  It's also important to remember that I have a backup buyer in John, so I'm not desperate to make a sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a higher price from Bob.  I still have 8 rounds left and I'm not desperate to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,750,000.  This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and hopefully, it will be more appealing to him.  It's also still above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject this offer and try to get a little closer to $1,500,000. I'm feeling confident that Bob will come up to my price, but I'm not going to rush into a deal.  I have a backup plan, and I have 6 rounds left.  There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a small concession from my previous counteroffer, but it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. With only 5 rounds left, I need to find a balance between getting a good price and closing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable price. There's no point in trying to squeeze out a little more money at this point -  I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal.  With only 4 rounds left, it's not worth risking that he might back out or I won't be able to negotiate a better price."
