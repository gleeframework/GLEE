"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's, but still higher than the product's value to you ($8,000).**  This means you can potentially negotiate further.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price.** You can counter-offer Alice or try to negotiate with John.

It's always a good idea to try to get the best possible deal, even if it means taking a little more time."
