"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary, and it also signals to Bob that this product is valuable.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more. I'll counteroffer in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer at $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a decent profit for me.  I believe this price might be attractive to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I would love to get more, $1,600,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this negotiation falls through."
