"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's still a great product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I think I can get closer to my desired price range with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I can't go as low as $9,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a great value for you considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd like to get a little more, $10,250 is a good price and significantly higher than selling to John. It's a good deal for both of us."
