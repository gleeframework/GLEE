We're still in a good negotiating position. Bob is consistently increasing his offers, showing his interest. We're getting closer to a potential compromise. Let's see if we can push a little further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  To show my good faith, I'm willing to accept $966,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 966000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and seriousness. 
* **Small Concession:** We're still aiming high but showing a willingness to compromise with a small concession.
* **Time Constraint:** With only a few rounds left, we want to push for a decision soon. 

This offer aims to either close the deal or prompt Bob to reveal his final acceptable price."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I would like to counter with an offer of $964,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $964,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $964,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unwilling to meet our near-final offer of $966,000.  While we could continue negotiating, his increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely we'll be able to bridge the gap significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer at $964,000 would mean losing out on a substantial amount compared to John's guaranteed offer.

Therefore, it's strategically advantageous to cut our losses and sell the product to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
