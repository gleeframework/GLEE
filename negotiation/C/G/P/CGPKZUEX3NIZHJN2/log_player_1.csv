"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer you $650,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $650,000 is more than my minimum, it's still a significant loss compared to what I believe the product is worth. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000 to show you I'm serious about making this deal work. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

While $750,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with that price. I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer, $750,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $780,000 is very close to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a slightly higher price. I'm confident that we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we settle at $800,000?  That's a firm offer from me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, as I'm right at my minimum price. However, I've already rejected several offers from Bob and we're running out of time.  Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, but I'm confident that I won't get a better offer from him if I reject Bob.  This deal with Bob is the best option at this point."
