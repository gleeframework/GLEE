``` 

The product is worth $120 to Alice and $150 to you. Since Alice is offering $130, there's room for negotiation. You can likely get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

You can still try to get a better price, and it's worth negotiating. Even though Alice is at the midpoint, you still have room to go lower."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still a bit hesitant, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $132? It's still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $132
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down from her original offer of $135 to $132. This is a good deal for you, as you're getting the product for less than your maximum of $150.  While you could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or you losing the opportunity to buy from John is high. Accepting this offer is the best course of action."
