"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $15000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate closer to that amount?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer you a price of $13000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I am still unable to meet you at $13000. I would like to propose a price of $11000. I hope this is a price you can consider.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I can offer you a price of $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally meet at a price that works for both of us.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final price of $11500. I hope this is a price you can consider.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I've made it clear that I'm not willing to go below $12500, and I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you at $12000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider selling the product to someone else.",12000.0,Alice,7,
