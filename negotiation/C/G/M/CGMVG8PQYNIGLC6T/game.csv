,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1500000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is significantly below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good starting point for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's continue the discussion.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being more flexible, but $1250000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950000 for the product. This represents a significant step closer to your price and I'm confident it's a fair offer considering the value I see in the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer.  While $1100000 is a good price, it's still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1050000.  I believe this is a fair and reasonable offer considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions.  I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal with this counteroffer.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close to an agreement.  While $1050000 is still a bit below my target, I'm willing to come down to $1075000. This represents a significant compromise from my previous offer and I'm hopeful we can finalize a deal. Let me know what you think.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting very close.  While $1075000 is tempting,  I'm still hoping to get it down to $1025000.  This is a very fair price considering the value we've discussed, and I'm confident we can close this deal if we meet in the middle.",1025000.0,Bob,8,

"Alice, we've come a long way in our negotiations, and I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to offer my final price of $1000000.
