"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to give myself room for negotiation. 
* **Enthusiastic tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** I'm not immediately setting a hard line, allowing for flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$85 is still above my minimum:**  While $85 is close to my minimum, I'm willing to see if I can get closer to my initial ask.
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows for more negotiation and potentially a higher price.
* **Not rushing to John:**  I'm still confident that I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering with a compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's $85 offer but demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm suggesting a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** A friendly approach helps keep the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little high at $92.50. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $88.75 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **No time to lose:** We're already in round 4, and with limited rounds, I don't want to risk losing a sale entirely.
* **Fair price:**  Bob's offer is reasonable, and I'm confident that I can't get much higher.
* **Opportunity cost:** Selling to John for $80 is a good option, but I'm willing to take a slightly lower price from Bob to avoid that opportunity cost."
