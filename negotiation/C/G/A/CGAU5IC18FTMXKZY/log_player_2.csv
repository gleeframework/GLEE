"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $100 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be willing to come down to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  Bob starts by offering $85, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm, acknowledging Alice's offer while stating Bob's position clearly. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** Bob doesn't want to go too low too quickly, as he needs to leave room for further negotiation if necessary.  He's also keeping in mind the $120 ""backup"" offer from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? That's still a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While $92.50 is closer to Bob's ideal price, there's still a gap.  
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  Bob wants to continue the negotiation process to see if he can get even closer to his target price of $85.  
* **Keeping Options Open:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to keep the negotiation going without committing to a price he might later regret."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a little high at $92.50. How about we split the difference and go with $88.75?  I'm really eager to get this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** Bob is moving closer to Alice's offer but still maintaining a strong negotiating stance.
* **Split the Difference:** Offering to split the difference shows a willingness to compromise and can be seen as a fair gesture.
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning eagerness helps build a sense of urgency and could potentially push Alice towards accepting."
