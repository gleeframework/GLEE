Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $10,000, he might be willing to pay more if he perceives it as valuable and scarce. Starting with a higher offer ($19,000) leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net: John will buy the product for $15,000. This allows Alice to be firmer in her negotiation with Bob.
* **Justification:** The message implies value to Bob and hints at the product's potential demand (listing it publicly). This framing can justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response."
