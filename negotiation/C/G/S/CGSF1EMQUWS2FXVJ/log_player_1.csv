{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for potential negotiation.  It also uses a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully motivate Bob to accept or counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,500? This price reflects the product's value while also being within a reasonable range for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800, which is the highest price I'm comfortable with. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite there. I'm not confident that I can push him any higher. To ensure I meet my minimum requirement, I'll sell the product to John for $10,000."
