"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product is worth $1000000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice or simply buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you and the potential gains I could make. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your target price, but it's still above your budget. You have two options:

1. **Reject and Counteroffer:** You can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000.
2. **Buy from John:** You can choose to buy from John immediately and avoid the risk of further negotiations.

Since the risk of further negotiation is low (you're already close to your budget), it makes sense to try and get a better deal by making a counteroffer."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,075,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1025000 is a tempting offer, but I'm still not ready to let go of the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell it to you for $1060000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me and the potential gains I could make. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you've already made several counteroffers.  It's likely that further negotiations will be more time-consuming and may not lead to a significantly better price. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum budget, eliminating the risk of further negotiation and potential for a worse deal."
