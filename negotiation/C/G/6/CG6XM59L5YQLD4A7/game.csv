"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but I have a firm budget in mind.  How about we meet closer to the middle ground at $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me to consider. My final offer is $1,600,000.  This is a very competitive price given the product's value.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
