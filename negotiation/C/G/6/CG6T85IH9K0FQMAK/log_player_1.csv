Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $13,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  $13,000 is below the product's value to Bob, giving him incentive to negotiate. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:**  This initial offer indicates you're willing to negotiate. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired price. You want to maximize your profit, so rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer. You can try to get closer to your desired $13,000 price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $12,000.  This is still a great deal for you, as it's significantly below the product's value to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Shows compromise:** You're willing to go down from $13,000 but still above your minimum. 
* **Remains above your minimum:** $12,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Offers a fair compromise:** $12,000 is closer to your original offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate.  

Let's see how Bob responds to this offer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,500 and $12,000, so I'll offer $11,250. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $11,250 is still slightly less than the $12,000 you were hoping for, it's a decent compromise and still significantly higher than what you'd get from John.  The negotiations have gone on for a while, and you're likely to lose more money by rejecting Bob's offer and risking further rounds of negotiation.  It's time to finalize the deal and secure a good profit."
