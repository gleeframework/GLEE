Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than that. Here's my offer:

{""product_price"": $850,000}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, so I'll reject it. I'll make a counteroffer to try to get a better price.

I'll offer Bob a price of $820,000. This is a compromise between his offer and my minimum price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $820,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway!"
