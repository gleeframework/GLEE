The product is worth $120 to Alice, and she's offering it for $140. This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's worth seeing if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a little too low for me.  How about $135?  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking for. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice is willing to come down to $135, which is still a good deal for me, since it's below my maximum price of $150.  It's probably worth taking this offer."
