Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This offer starts the negotiation by leaving some room for compromise, while still aiming for a price significantly closer to my desired outcome than John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price than John's offer, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

I'm going to counter with $925,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's last offer, and closer to my desired price. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal, and I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob. I'm also concerned that if I reject again and make a counteroffer, I risk losing him entirely."
