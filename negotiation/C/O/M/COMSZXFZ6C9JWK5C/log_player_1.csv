Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1300000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $1150000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,150,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the true value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1200000 for the product, which aligns closely with your original asking price. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a great outcome!  Bob's offer of $1,200,000 meets my minimum price requirement, and it's a fair deal for both of us. I'll accept it and move forward with the transaction."
