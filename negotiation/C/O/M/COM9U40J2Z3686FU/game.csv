"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you attribute to it. However, considering my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1500000. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to my maximum budget of $1000000? I believe there might be room for compromise that could benefit both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints and appreciate your interest in the product. While $1000000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial solution. Let's split the difference and settle on $1250000. This price reflects both the value I place on the product and your budget limitations. I believe it's a fair offer that allows us to move forward.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
