"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations.  While $1,800,000 is a bit below what I had in mind, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this still reflects the true value of the product and the substantial returns it offers.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm proposing $1,950,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being mindful of my budget.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
