{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'd like to start with $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a high price, but it's still lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($8,000). It also opens the door for negotiation by inviting Bob to respond with his thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product sounds interesting, but $10000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $8250?  This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is above my minimum of $8,000 and represents a good compromise. It's worth accepting this offer rather than risking a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a sale to John for the lower amount."
