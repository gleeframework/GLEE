# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to offers, but I'd like to start with $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his budget, and he has a backup option with John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7500 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8500.  This reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal.  Let me know if you're interested.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still get the product for a lower price from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if she'll come down even more."
