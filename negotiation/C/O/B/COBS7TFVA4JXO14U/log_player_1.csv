Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's not the full $12,000 Bob is willing to pay, but it's also significantly higher than my minimum of $10,000. 
* **Shows confidence:**  I'm not starting at a lowball price, suggesting I believe in the value of the product. 
* **Opens the conversation:** The message is friendly and invites Bob to respond, starting the negotiation process. 

I'll be ready to either accept or counter Bob's offer, or move on to John if things don't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something a bit more reasonable. Would you be willing to consider $10,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer, hoping to close the gap and finalize the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good compromise.  It's also very likely that if I reject this offer, we'll continue haggling back and forth for a while.  It's more efficient to accept and move on."
