"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I'm not comfortable with the initial price of $900,000. I'm willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to my company. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  The product is worth significantly more than that.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $850,000. This still allows for a good profit for me, while also giving you a fair price.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
