Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit higher than $7,000. I can offer you $8,500. This is my final offer, so think carefully before responding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500, and her ""final offer"" language suggests she's getting firm. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation when you have a guaranteed price of $8,000 from John."
