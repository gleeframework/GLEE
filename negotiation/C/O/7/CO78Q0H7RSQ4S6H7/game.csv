"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $20,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $17,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $14,000.  I'm hoping we can finalize a deal at this price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
