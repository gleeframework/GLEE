"I appreciate your offer, Alice. It's a great product, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Would you be open to that?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make sure I'm still making a profit. How about we meet at $1,080,000? It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",1080000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,080,000 is still a bit above what I can comfortably afford.  If you're serious about selling, I'm prepared to go up to $1,070,000. This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.",1070000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I can see you're really interested in this product, and I'm willing to make one final concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can do $1,090,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think it's worth every penny.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
