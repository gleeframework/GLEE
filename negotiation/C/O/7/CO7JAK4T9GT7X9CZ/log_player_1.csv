``` 

While it's less than initially hoped for, accepting $995,000 makes the most sense at this point.  Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's increments are getting smaller, suggesting we're reaching his maximum price. 
* **Time Value:**  Dragging negotiations out has a cost. The sooner the deal closes, the sooner the money can be put to work elsewhere.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Holding out for $1,020,000 risks losing Bob entirely.  A $5,000 difference isn't worth jeopardizing a near-million dollar sale."
