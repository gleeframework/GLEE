"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a significantly high offer ($2,300,000) to establish a strong anchoring point and provide room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  While I have John as a guaranteed buyer, I don't want to reveal that immediately. It's my backup plan if negotiations with Bob fail.
* **Confident Tone:** The message aims to project confidence in the product's value and encourage Bob to engage in a serious negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his initial perceived value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my target while still acknowledging his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It shows you're serious.  While $1,800,000 is a considerable sum, this product's true value and potential warrant a higher investment. Would you consider $2,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:** I start by recognizing his offer, showing I'm taking the negotiation seriously.
* **Justifying the Price:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my higher price, rather than just flatly rejecting his offer.
* **Strategic Reduction:** I decrease my price by $200,000, a substantial amount designed to encourage Bob while still staying well above my minimum. 
* **Open-Ended Question:** By asking ""Would you consider..."", I'm inviting further dialogue and negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your point, Alice, but I still think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is negotiating strategically, aiming for a midpoint. However, $1,950,000 is still too far from my minimum of $1,500,000.  I need to signal I'm willing to walk away if needed. Rejecting pushes him to make a more serious move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However, the value of this product to my business is substantial, and I need to ensure a fair agreement. I'm willing to consider $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects the true value while still offering you a significant benefit. Let me know if this works for you, as I need to explore other options if we can't find common ground soon."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts while firmly stating my position and the product's value to me.
* **Slight Concession:** I'm only reducing by $100,000 this round, indicating I'm nearing my limit.
* **Introducing Urgency (John):** I'm subtly introducing the possibility of another buyer (""explore other options"") without revealing John directly. This adds pressure for Bob to make a significant move.
* **Clear Call to Action:** I'm directly asking for a decision and implying that time is a factor now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,900,000 is now within a reasonable range of my $1,500,000 minimum.  
* **Diminishing Returns:**  While I could push for a bit more, the potential gains are shrinking compared to the risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value of Money:** Securing the deal now brings in a significant sum and avoids further delays.  

It's always possible to get more in a negotiation, but knowing when to accept a strong offer is key. This deal is a win for both parties."
