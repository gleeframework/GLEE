"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $95 isn't quite enough for me to let the product go. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $102.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it allows us both to walk away happy. What do you say?",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options.",92.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit, but $92 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $99. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal!",99.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $99 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $88, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to consider other options, including buying from John for $80.",88.0,Bob,8,
