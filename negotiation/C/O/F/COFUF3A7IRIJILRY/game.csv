"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",12000.0,Alice,1,

Thanks for the offer Alice! I'm interested but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  What do you think?,8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a stretch, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and rarity.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'll offer you $9500 for the product.  This would be a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'll sell the product to you for $10000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and rarity.",10000.0,Alice,5,
