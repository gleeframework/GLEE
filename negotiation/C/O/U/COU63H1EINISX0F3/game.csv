"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  your initial offer is a bit high for me. Given my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer you $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, however, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we meet halfway at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still respecting my budget. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
