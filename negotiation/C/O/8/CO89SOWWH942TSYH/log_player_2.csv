"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think it's a fair price given its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is quite high. There's plenty of room for negotiation before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That's a bit too high for me, I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant jump down but leaves room for negotiation. It signals that I'm serious about buying but need a lower price to make it worthwhile."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $8,500 is still a long way from my target price. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,500?  That would allow me to make the purchase comfortably."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This counter-offer makes a smaller adjustment and highlights my budget constraints. It keeps the negotiation moving but also suggests I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,500 is still too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $8,250. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value of the product for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough call. Alice is stating it's her final offer, and $8,250 isn't that far from my ideal price. However, I'm willing to risk one more counter-offer to see if I can get closer to $8,000. If Alice rejects it, I'll likely take her previous offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,250 is very close, but I'm trying to stick to a hard limit.  If you'd be willing to come down to $8,000, I'd be able to close the deal right now."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

This counter-offer goes all-in on my ideal price.  It's clear and firm, but also respectful of Alice's final offer.  If she rejects this, I'm prepared to either accept her previous offer or walk away and go with John."
