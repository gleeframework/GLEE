{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}

This offer allows for potential negotiation while still ensuring a profit for Alice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being flexible.  However, I'm looking to spend closer to $10,500.  Would you be willing to go that low? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is a decent price, it's still lower than Alice's minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Alice to potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,500 is just a little too low for me.  How about $11,000? That would still leave us both with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
