"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,000? That seems like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
