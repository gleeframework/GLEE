"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advantageous to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Acknowledging Value:**  By mentioning ""its value,"" I subtly remind Bob of the product's worth to him, potentially making him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it's not unreasonable considering Bob's perceived value.  The phrase ""a fair starting point for negotiations"" indicates a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($800,000) and the product's value to him ($1,000,000). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. While selling to John is an option, there's still room for negotiation with Bob to potentially secure a much better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you have budget considerations, but $700,000 is significantly below the product's market value and what it offers your business.  To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a competitive offer, reflecting the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** While I'm lowering my price, I'm making it clear that $700,000 is unacceptable.  
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob's business, aiming to justify the higher price.
* **Concession:**  The price reduction to $900,000 shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the value of the product and my budget, I would like to counterpropose a price of $850,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000. While you could potentially push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
