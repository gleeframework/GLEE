{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you and this is a very competitive price."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $120. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $145 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference ($30) while still staying below Bob's maximum valuation. This increases the likelihood of him accepting and you making a good profit.

**Why not higher?**

While you could try for a higher price, getting closer to $150 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  It's better to secure a very good deal than risk losing it altogether."
