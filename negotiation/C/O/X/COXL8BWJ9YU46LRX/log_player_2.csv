"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you and this is a very competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Your Maximum:** You're willing to pay up to $150.
* **Alice's Offer:** $145
* **John's Offer:** $150

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can still do better. You should reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with her or find another seller offering a better deal."
