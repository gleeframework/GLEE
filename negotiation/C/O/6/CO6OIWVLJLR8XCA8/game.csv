"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. This would still be a profitable deal for you, as it's significantly above your valuation. Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price still offers a significant profit for you, and it's closer to what I'm looking to receive. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford right now.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $1,375,000.  This would still represent a strong profit for you and it's closer to my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution.",1375000.0,Bob,4,
