# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $110. Given its value and quality, this is an excellent opportunity for you to benefit from its features. Don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or need more information about it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you can get the product for $10 less from John. Since your goal is to save money and you're indifferent between buying from Alice or John, purchasing from John is the most financially sound decision."
