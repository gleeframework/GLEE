""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,000 or a bit lower still represents a significant profit over the $12,000 backup offer from John."
