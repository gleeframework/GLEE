{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best price I can offer right now. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still securing a profit for Alice. It's slightly less than Bob's perceived value, giving him incentive to negotiate, but it's also significantly higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price. This allows for a potential win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than Alice's minimum acceptable price.  While Bob is interested, his offer isn't high enough to warrant a sale. It's better to continue negotiating and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is still a great price considering the value of the product for you. Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we both want to make a fair deal. How about we settle at $1,250,000? That's a significant compromise on my initial offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise and it's higher than the price John is offering. Selling to Bob ensures a better profit, so it makes sense to accept his offer."
