"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $9,500.  What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500.  This is a fair price, considering it's worth $8,000 to you. What do you say?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $8,500. This product is worth a lot to both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product is valuable to us both, but $9,000 is still a bit high.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair compromise.  Let's make this deal happen!",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $8,750 is close, but I need to get a bit more for it.  Would you be willing to do $8,900? I think that's a fair compromise and we can both walk away happy.",8900.0,Alice,5,
