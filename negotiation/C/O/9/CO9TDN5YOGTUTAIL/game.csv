"Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.
