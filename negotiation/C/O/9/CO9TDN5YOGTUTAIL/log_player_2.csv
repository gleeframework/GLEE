"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. There are 9 more rounds, and Alice has indicated a willingness to negotiate. It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but it's still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:**  This counteroffer is a significant jump down from Alice's offer, showcasing Bob's intent to negotiate aggressively.
* **Justified Offer:** The message provides a reason for the price, framing it as a fair offer that considers both parties' interests.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While this is a bold move, it leaves room for Alice to counter without feeling pressured to accept immediately. This sets the stage for a dynamic negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a good deal, but I believe the product's value is higher than $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** While $1,025,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still $25,000 over his preferred price.  
* **Potential for Lower Price:** Alice has shown willingness to negotiate. There's a chance Bob can secure a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Buying from John would guarantee the product for $1,000,000, but there's a chance Alice might come down to a lower price in the next few rounds. The risk of waiting a few more rounds is worth the potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum for this product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows me to proceed with the purchase."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Bob states this is his maximum price, showing seriousness and setting a clear boundary. 
* **Value Proposition:**  The message reaffirms that Bob sees value in the product, justifying the offer.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal, as John is an alternative option. 

By being firm but respectful, Bob aims to close the deal at his target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to reach your maximum budget, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can agree on this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** Alice's offer is only $50,000 below Bob's maximum, but it's still outside his ideal price range. 
* **Limited Negotiation Room:** Alice has stated this is her final compromise, indicating there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Guarantee and Certainty:**  Buying from John guarantees the product for Bob's preferred price. While there's a slight chance Alice might come down further, the risk of continued negotiation is not worth the potential $50,000 savings. 

This is a calculated decision to prioritize certainty over potential savings, especially with a limited number of rounds remaining."
