"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $2,000,000. I know it's a high price, but its value to you is significant. Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have 10 rounds, and John is a guaranteed buyer for a higher price. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. The value this product will bring to your business is substantial.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1,750,000.  This price reflects a significant discount from my initial offer and still allows me to get closer to my desired value."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my expenses. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,400,000 is still below my desired value. I have 6 more rounds with Bob, and I can still secure a better deal. Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not willing to do that unless I'm absolutely certain I can't get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product will bring you. "", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm running out of rounds with Bob.  I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away.  Selling to John guarantees me a better price than I can get from Bob at this point."
