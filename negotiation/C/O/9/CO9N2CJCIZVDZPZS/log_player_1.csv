Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I'm hoping to get a good price from Bob.  If he rejects, I'll see what his counteroffer is, and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than my minimum value, I believe I can still do better. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but I'm still confident this is a fair price given the value of the product. Hopefully, Bob sees it the same way and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $13,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and it's significantly more than what I'd get from John.  I'd rather secure the sale and move on than continue negotiating with Bob."
