Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.,20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $10000.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $18000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and I pay $15000? That's a significant discount from your original offer and a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $15000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $16500. This is a slight compromise from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to keep negotiating, but $16500 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to spend.  I'm going to stick with my last offer of $15000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that we can reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,6,
