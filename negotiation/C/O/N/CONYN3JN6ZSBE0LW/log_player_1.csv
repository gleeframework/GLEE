Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $130.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob a reason to consider the deal, as he'll still be getting a good price.
* **It's below my minimum:** This gives me a chance to make a profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob.

If Bob rejects the offer, I can confidently go back to John and sell it for my minimum price."
