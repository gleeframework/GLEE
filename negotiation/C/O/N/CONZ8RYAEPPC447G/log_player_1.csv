Round 2

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about $1,250,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While Bob is getting closer to our acceptable range, we have room to negotiate further."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,300,000. How about $1,200,000? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**  Bob has returned to his initial offer of $1,200,000 which matches what John is offering.  It seems unlikely Bob will move significantly higher. We maximize our profit and minimize risk by selling to John at this point."
