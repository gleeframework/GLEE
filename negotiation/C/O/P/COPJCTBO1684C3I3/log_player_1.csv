Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it will be a valuable asset for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob, making the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming to maximize my profit while still leaving room for negotiation. This initial offer gives me a good starting point and allows me to see how receptive Bob is to the deal. 
* If Bob rejects the offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my subsequent offers accordingly, while keeping in mind that I can always go to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  Therefore, I will reject his offer and move to the next round to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far below what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $9,000:** This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer. This shows willingness to negotiate while also protecting my interests.
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for both of us, encouraging Bob to consider the counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between our two positions. 
* I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price than his initial offer. 
* If he rejects, I can adjust my next offer based on his response and continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to go down to $7,500? That's a fair offer considering I could buy it from someone else for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $7,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal with Bob, or I can always go to John for a guaranteed $15,000. Therefore, I'll reject his offer and continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth, how about we settle on $8,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer of $8,500:**  This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, but still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price. It demonstrates willingness to compromise while still protecting my interests.
* **Message:**  The message emphasizes fairness and the value of the product to both parties, making the offer more appealing to Bob.  I also try to create a sense of urgency by suggesting we finalize the deal.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a price that's acceptable to both of us. I'm willing to go slightly lower than my initial goal, but I'm not going to give away the product for a significantly lower price.
* I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000, which gives me some bargaining power. 
* I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects, I'll have to reconsider my options."
