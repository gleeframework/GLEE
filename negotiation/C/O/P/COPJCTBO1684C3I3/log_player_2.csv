Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is far below what the product is worth. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This is still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  However, $7,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value of the product and our back-and-forth, how about we settle on $8,500?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at your target price rather than trying to haggle Alice down another $500."
