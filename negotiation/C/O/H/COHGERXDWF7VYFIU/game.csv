"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is a good offer, but it's still slightly below my target.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,000,000? This price would allow me to achieve a reasonable profit while still offering you a great deal on a product that will significantly benefit your business.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
