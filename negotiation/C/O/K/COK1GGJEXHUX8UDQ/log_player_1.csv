Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm starting with my minimum acceptable price. This is because John is willing to pay this amount, and I'd rather not risk losing out on the deal with him. If Bob rejects, I can always lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $11,000. This is still above Bob's offer but shows a willingness to negotiate. I hope he'll find this counteroffer more appealing."

Bob is consistently offering far less than my minimum, and I'm not willing to continue this negotiation. I will sell the product to John for $12,000."
