"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 
 
 Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $11,500 is still too high for Bob, as he is willing to pay a maximum of $12,000.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, Bob, but I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is better than the initial price, it's still too high for Bob. He's willing to pay a maximum of $12,000, so there's still room to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I can offer it to you for $11,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At this point, Alice has made a significant concession, and Bob is getting a good price.  Continuing to negotiate is likely to lead to a stalemate, or Alice might walk away.  It's better to secure the deal at this price than risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice and having to buy at a higher price from John."
