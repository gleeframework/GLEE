"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I value your time and appreciate your interest.  While $7,500 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  Let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to go down to $8,000.  This is a good price considering the product's worth.",8000.0,Alice,5,
