"Alice, $2000000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in this product, I'm only able to offer $1200000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1200000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1600000.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $1400000? That's a significant amount of money, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
