"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $10,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly opening message sets a good tone for the negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value without revealing too much. This might pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Can you meet me in the middle at $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum. This suggests he might be willing to pay more.  I'm holding out for a better deal. 
* **Negotiation is Key:** I'm in a strong position because I have multiple rounds and an alternative buyer. There's no need to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $8,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Proposal:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but proposing a counteroffer that's halfway between our last two offers.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair deal"" to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I'm still above my minimum price, leaving room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $8500, but I really need to get as close to $8000 as possible. Can you consider going any lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching Minimum:** Bob's offer is at my minimum price. This means I'm unlikely to get a better offer from him. 
* **Time is Money:** We're already in the 4th round. Further negotiation could be time-consuming and might not result in a higher price.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price with no risk of a lower offer. 

It's important to remember that while I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of a lower price or a prolonged negotiation isn't worth it when I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum."
