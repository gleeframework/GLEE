"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you seem quite set on this product which is great! I want to see us make a deal here. To be fair, $11,500 is cutting it close to my minimum. How about we split the difference and do $12,000? This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
