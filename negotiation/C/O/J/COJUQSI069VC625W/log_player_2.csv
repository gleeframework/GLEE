Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects the maximum value I see for the product, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for further discussion."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $950,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

$950,000 is still too high for my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. "", ""product_price"": 900000}
