"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll recognize its worth.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,000,000 is higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000.  This reflects the maximum value I see for the product, and I'm confident it's a fair starting point for further discussion.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls significantly short of the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I can't accept anything less than $950,000. This is a very competitive price for something of this caliber.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe reflects a fair compromise. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
