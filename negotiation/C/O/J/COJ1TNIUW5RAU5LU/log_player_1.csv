Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum acceptable price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential,"" aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, you invite him to counter-offer, opening the door for a potentially higher final price. 

**Strategy:**

The goal is to secure the highest possible price from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed backup offer from John. By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, you maximize your chances of exceeding John's offer. If Bob rejects the initial offer, you can gradually lower the price during negotiations, ultimately aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000."
