"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This product offers significant value, and I'm sure you'll see a return on that investment.",19000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're still quite far apart. I appreciate you coming down, but I can't justify going higher than $9,500 for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle - how about $16,500? I think that's a fair compromise.",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, that price is still a bit too high for me.  I can offer $11,000.  This is a fair offer, considering I can always get it from John for $10,000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I know this product is valuable to you, even if you're not quite willing to admit it yet.  You're right, you could go to John, but I'm offering you a chance to cut out the middleman.  My final offer is $14,000.  Take it or leave it.",14000.0,Alice,7,
