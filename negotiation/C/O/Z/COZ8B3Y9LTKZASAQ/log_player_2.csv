"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11500.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12000 to you.  Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  He is willing to pay up to $12,000, so there is room for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  This product is worth $12,000 to me, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $10500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject the offer. He can still get a better price than $11,000, and the product is worth $12,000 to him. It's better to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $10,750. This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10900?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's finalize this now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  This is a good price for him, as he's willing to pay up to $12,000, and he's saved $1,100.  While he could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price."
