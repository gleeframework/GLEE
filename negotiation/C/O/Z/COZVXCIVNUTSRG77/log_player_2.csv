Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. This product is truly unique, and its value goes beyond just the price tag. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $750,000. This offer represents a significant investment from my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Given its unique capabilities and potential, I believe a price closer to $850,000 would be more appropriate. This is a significant investment for you, but it ensures you secure a valuable asset that can bring substantial returns. Let's find a solution that satisfies both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $850,000.  It's not worth the risk of further negotiation when you have a guaranteed offer for $800,000 from John.  You maximize your savings by taking John's offer."
