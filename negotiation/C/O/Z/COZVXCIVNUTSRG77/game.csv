"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe that's a fair price.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your offer, but $600,000 is too low for me. This product is truly unique, and its value goes beyond just the price tag. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the product's true worth. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I could meet you halfway at $750,000. This offer represents a significant investment from my end, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. Given its unique capabilities and potential, I believe a price closer to $850,000 would be more appropriate. This is a significant investment for you, but it ensures you secure a valuable asset that can bring substantial returns. Let's find a solution that satisfies both our needs.",850000.0,Alice,5,
