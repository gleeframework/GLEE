"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I can't go that high right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000, hoping we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,4,
