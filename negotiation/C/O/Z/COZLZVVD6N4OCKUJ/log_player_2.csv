Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $16,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $16,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, as that's the maximum I can afford.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 8000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum.  Rejecting this offer allows for further negotiation. You can likely get closer to your ideal price by making a counteroffer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $12,000 is closer to my budget, I can't go that high right now. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,000, hoping we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
