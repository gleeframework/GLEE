"I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still not quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid having to sell to John.",10000.0,Alice,5,
