Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I know it's worth that much to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it makes him immediately reject it.  It leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially earn more than the minimum you need."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $9,000 is tempting, it's below your minimum acceptable price. You can likely negotiate a better deal with Bob, or sell to John for your minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below your desired goal. You can likely negotiate a better price with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still not quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000? That way, we both get a fair deal, and I can avoid having to sell to John."", ""product_price"": 10000}
