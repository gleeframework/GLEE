,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,050,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows me to acquire the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,250,000, but I want to make it clear that this is my final offer within this range.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still unable to go above $1,150,000. I'm willing to make a final offer at this price. It's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product and our respective financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that we've been discussing this for a while, and I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,200,000, which was my initial offer. I'm willing to make a new offer that's closer to your desired price, but I need to get closer to my minimum. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,225,000. This is a compromise that I'm willing to make, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product.",1225000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,200,000, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is as close to my minimum as I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,9,
