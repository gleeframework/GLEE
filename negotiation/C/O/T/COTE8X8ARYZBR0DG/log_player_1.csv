{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking $15,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $15,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. This allows room for negotiation and potentially a good profit.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and make him more willing to negotiate.
* **Open-ended:** My message ends with an open-ended question, inviting Bob to engage in the conversation and potentially start the negotiation process.

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  My next move will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his potential value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my target:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a higher price. I want to see if I can convince Bob to come closer to my initial asking price.

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $12,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?  It's a good price for both of us and will allow me to move this sale forward."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  The counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise, demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Appeal to mutual benefit:**  The message highlights the potential benefits for both Bob and me, emphasizing that the price is fair and will allow the deal to move forward.
* **Keep the conversation going:**  By suggesting a specific price and framing it as a positive solution, I encourage Bob to consider my counteroffer seriously. 

**Important Note:**  This counteroffer is a calculated move.  I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to go down to $12800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $12,800 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to accept this offer, as the potential gain is significant.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob might become less willing to negotiate further, or he might simply walk away from the deal.
* **Opportunity Cost:** By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale and avoid the risk of having to sell to John for a lower price.

**Conclusion:** While I prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I believe accepting Bob's offer is the most strategic choice in this situation. It balances my desire for profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
