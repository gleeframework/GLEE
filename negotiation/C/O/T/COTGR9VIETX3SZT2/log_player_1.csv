Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $100 as possible, but I also want to make sure Bob is likely to accept. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price that offers a potential ""win-win"". Bob gets the product for $15 less than its value to him, and I get $15 more than I would from John. 
* **Simple and Direct:**  The message is clear and highlights that this is a special offer for Bob."
