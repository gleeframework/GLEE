"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $8,000 is better than nothing, I can still try to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000.  I'll see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and settle on $8,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take $8,200, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $10,000. We've only had a few rounds, and I think there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. How about we settle on $8,300? It's a small step closer to my minimum price, and it still represents a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8300}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  We're getting closer to a deal, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise.  If not, I'll sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm prepared to sell the product for $8,350.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and respects your budget."", ""product_price"": 8350}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and am willing to offer $8,300 for the product. This brings us closer together and stays within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting quite close, but I'm still not comfortable with selling for less than $8,500. Given that we only have two rounds left, I'm going to sell to John for $10,000.  It's a better deal overall, and I don't want to risk ending up with an outcome that's significantly less than my minimum price."
