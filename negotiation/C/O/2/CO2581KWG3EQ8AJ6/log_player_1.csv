{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. Its value to you is undeniable, and I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000.  Let's discuss and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1000000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This offer reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can close this quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desire to save, $850,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This offer still allows you a substantial profit, and it gets us closer to a deal. "", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $900000? This offer gives us both a good deal and allows us to finalize the sale quickly.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and represents a significant profit for me. Accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly and avoid the risk of further negotiation or potential rejection."
