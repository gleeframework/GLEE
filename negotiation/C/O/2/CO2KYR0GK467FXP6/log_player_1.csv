Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you can aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still potentially settle closer to $120-$130.
* **Avoid Appearing Desperate:** Offering it at $100 right away might make Bob think the product's value is low or that you're desperate to sell.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and increasing the chances of Bob accepting the offer."
