"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your interest in the product and appreciate your willingness to meet its value. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the opportunity it presents for you. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both parties.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm committed to making this work, but I can only go up to $825,000. Would you consider that as a final offer? ",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I understand your financial constraints. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $850,000. This remains a premium offer that reflects the product's value, while also being more accessible to you. I hope this proposal will facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction.",850000.0,Alice,5,
