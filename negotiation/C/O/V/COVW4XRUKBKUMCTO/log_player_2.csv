"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present our premier product to you. It is an exceptional opportunity to own a piece that holds immense value and significance. Considering its worth and the benefits it offers, I am extending a special invitation to acquire this product at a price of $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $950,000 is more than his maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay up to $800,000. Would you be willing to consider that? "", ""product_price"": 800000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your interest in the product and appreciate your willingness to meet its value. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $875,000. This price reflects the product's unique qualities and the opportunity it presents for you.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $875,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his maximum of $800,000. It's worth seeing if he can negotiate further with Alice or buy from John to avoid overspending."
