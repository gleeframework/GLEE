"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique benefits and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair starting point for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with an offer slightly higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By opening at $1,150,000, we're aiming for a price that's closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while still maintaining a strong margin above our minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000).
* **Positive Tone:**  The message conveys enthusiasm and highlights the product's value to Bob, setting a positive and collaborative tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to negotiate a better price. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is tempting, we're still in the early stages of negotiation.  We have room to counter and try to secure a price closer to his perceived value of $1,200,000.  Rejecting his offer now keeps the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is reasonable, I believe the product's true value warrants a slightly higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,130,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my eagerness to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 1130000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession but Firm:** We acknowledge Bob's offer and willingness to negotiate by making a concession ($20,000).  However, the concession is small, demonstrating that we value the product highly and are not desperate to close at any price. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""significant discount"" and our ""eagerness"" for a deal, we're framing this counteroffer as both attractive and fair.
* **Middle Ground:** We're aiming for a price point between Bob's offer and our initial ask, encouraging him to move closer to our desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,090,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting close, but Bob's offer is still below our desired outcome. We've made consistent concessions, and it's time to hold firm and see if he's willing to move closer to our price. The risk of losing the deal is relatively low at this stage, as we're still well above our guaranteed offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I respect that.  I've already made significant adjustments to bridge the gap. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a lower price. However, I believe in finding the right fit for this product, and I value our discussions.  I'm willing to consider $1,110,000 as my final offer.  This is a substantial concession on my end, and I believe it represents a fair and attractive opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1110000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:** We introduce the concept of a ""final offer"" to signal that we're reaching our limit and won't concede much further.
* **Competition and Value:**  Mentioning the other buyer (without specifics) subtly creates a sense of urgency and competition while emphasizing that we prioritize finding the right buyer, not just the highest bidder.
* **Transparency and Justification:**  By being transparent about our position and emphasizing the significant concession, we're hoping to encourage Bob to make a decisive move closer to our target price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  Offering $1,110,000 keeps us above John's offer while presenting Bob with a seemingly last-chance opportunity to secure the product at a price significantly lower than his initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to consider my offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet us near our desired price point.  We've used strong negotiating tactics (final offers, competition) and made substantial concessions.  It's unlikely he will significantly increase his offer.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is the safe play now, guaranteeing a good profit and avoiding the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
