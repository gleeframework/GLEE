"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you think the product is worth $900000 to you, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is my best offer so far, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $900000. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $920000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",920000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $920000 is enough for me to make a profit. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my minimum price of $1000000. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $980000. This is my best compromise so far, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",980000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $920000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920000 and $980000, which would be $950000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $950000. I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the point where it's not worth continuing the negotiation. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll sell the product to you for $990000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",990000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $990000. However, I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $975000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",975000.0,Alice,9,
