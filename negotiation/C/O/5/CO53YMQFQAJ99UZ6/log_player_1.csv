Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. It's important to remember that Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so there's potential to earn more.  I'll be prepared to counteroffer if needed, but I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $1,000,000. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer of $900,000 and my previous offer of $1,000,000. I'm hoping this will be appealing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm still open to negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $850,000 is more than what John is offering, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm offering $900,000. This is the same as Bob's last offer, and I'm willing to meet him here. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm hoping he'll accept it. If he doesn't, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

Bob is getting too low with his offers. I'm not willing to go any lower than $850,000.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John."
