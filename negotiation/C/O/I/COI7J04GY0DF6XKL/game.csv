"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate it,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,
