"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,500 is a better deal than John's offer of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $14,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can find common ground.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is still better than buying from John, Bob can likely get a better price. The product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for further negotiation. Bob will likely get the product for closer to his desired price of $13,500."
