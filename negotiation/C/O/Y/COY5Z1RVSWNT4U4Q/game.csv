Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I believe you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I think this is a fair price considering its rarity and potential benefits. What do you think?,950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a deal at $850000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
