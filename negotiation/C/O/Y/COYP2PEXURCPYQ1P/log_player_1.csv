Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment.  I'm asking for $1,700,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can take it from there."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have leverage. Aiming higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,700,000 gives you room to negotiate down if Bob pushes back, while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and Bob's potential gain, making the higher price seem more palatable."
