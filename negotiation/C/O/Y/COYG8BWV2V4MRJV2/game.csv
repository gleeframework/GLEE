"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,600,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I acknowledge your offer, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but  $1,450,000 is still outside of my comfortable range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
