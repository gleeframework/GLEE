Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $18,000. I know it's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a bit closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I can't go as low as $15,000. I'm willing to come down to $16,500 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd ideally like to get closer to $16,500, Bob's offer of $15,500 is still a good deal for me. It's more than John is offering, and we're already halfway through the negotiations. It's time to secure the sale."
