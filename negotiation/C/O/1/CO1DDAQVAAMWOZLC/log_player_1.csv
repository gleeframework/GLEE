"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However,  $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I could meet you halfway at $750,000. This is a fair offer considering its true value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to budge much beyond his $750,000 offer. Holding out for a slightly better deal from Bob isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
