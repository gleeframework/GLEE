``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a message that emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer.  We'll see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm interested in the product, but I'm trying to stay within a budget. Can you meet me at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low for me. It's below my minimum value for the product.  I will counteroffer and see if we can find a price we both agree on."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within a budget, but $10,000 simply isn't enough for this product. It's truly unique and offers significant value. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a fair price that still allows for some wiggle room for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $12500 is a good fit for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is still below my initial desired price, but it's getting closer. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's above my minimum value of $10,000 and represents a reasonable compromise."
