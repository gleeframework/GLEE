"Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that the product holds a significant importance to me, reflecting its true worth at $12,000. However, considering your anticipated appreciation and potential use of the product, I understand its value to you stands at $8,000. To facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction, I propose a price that aims to capture the essence of its value while being fair to both parties. Would you be interested in discussing this further? My offer is $9,500 for the product. I look forward to your response.",9500.0,Alice,1,
