"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your business.  I'm offering it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's true worth.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $1,400,000.** This is better than buying from John for $1,500,000, but you can still do better.
* **You want to save as much money as possible.**  Rejecting Alice's offer means you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her or find a better deal elsewhere."
