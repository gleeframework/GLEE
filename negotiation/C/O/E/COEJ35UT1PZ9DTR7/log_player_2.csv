"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is close to your maximum budget. You have a good chance of getting a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,500.  What do you think?"",
  ""product_price"": 8500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer lower than your target price. This gives you room to negotiate upwards if needed.
* **Respectful but Firm:**  The message acknowledges Alice's offer while clearly stating your price limit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $8,500 leaves space for a potential compromise between your initial offer and Alice's asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,500 is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? This offer still saves you a significant amount compared to its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your desired price range, $9,750 is still significantly higher than both her value ($8,000) and a comfortable profit margin for you. There's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
  ""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $9,750 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit more budget-friendly. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair offer."",
  ""product_price"": 9000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** This counteroffer shows willingness to move towards Alice's price but in smaller increments, indicating you're looking for a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget, you reiterate your constraints without being overly aggressive.
* **Middle Ground:** $9,000 is a solid middle ground between your initial offer and Alice's current price, leaving room for potential compromise."
