"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to get closer to the price I'm looking to pay. Can you consider my offer?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. Let's try to find common ground. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,750 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'll offer $10,875. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. What do you think?",10875.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit uncomfortable with $10,687.50.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time. I'll offer $10,781.25. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's close this deal.",10781.25,Alice,7,
