Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could result in a quicker sale and still a significant profit. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation. Bob gets the product for $150,000 less than its worth to him, and you make $150,000 more than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** Mentioning other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision faster."
