I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation, but it's still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm going to reject it and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering at $15,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable compromise than Bob's initial offer."

Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. I'm happy to take this deal, but John offers the same price and I don't need to continue negotiating with Bob.  I'll sell to John."
