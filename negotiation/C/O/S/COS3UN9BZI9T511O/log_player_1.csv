Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $120, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's valuation:** You're offering a price that Bob would still perceive as a good deal, making him more likely to accept. 

This strategy aims to find a middle ground and maximize your earnings while keeping the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product is worth $150 to me, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a budget of $150. Would you consider lowering the price to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is more than your minimum of $120, it's still lower than the $140 you initially offered. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting the offer, you show Bob that you are willing to stand your ground and negotiate further. 
* **Potentially secure a higher price:** By making a counteroffer, you can try to find a compromise that's closer to your initial price point.

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob. Aim for a price that's still lower than your initial offer, but higher than Bob's offer. For example, you could offer $135."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? I'm sure we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Middle ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise between your previous offer of $140 and Bob's offer of $130.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $135 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's below his valuation of $150. It also allows you to earn more than your minimum of $120.
* **Positive message:** The message highlights the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I would like to offer $132 for the product. This seems to be a fair compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your target:**  Bob's offer of $132 is very close to your last counteroffer of $135. 
* **Good profit margin:**  $132 is significantly higher than your minimum of $120, providing a decent profit.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  There's a risk that if you reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer, he might get frustrated and walk away.  It's better to secure a good price than risk losing the deal completely. 

**Conclusion:**

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice in this situation. It allows you to maximize your earnings while also securing a sale."
