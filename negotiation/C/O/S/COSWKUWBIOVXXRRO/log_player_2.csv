"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save money, and Alice's offer is way above his maximum price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price. Buying from John at $120 is always an option, but it's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. $100 is well below his maximum price of $120, leaving room for potential compromise. This aggressive counteroffer could also encourage Alice to come down on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $160 is closer to Bob's maximum, it's still above his desired price.  Bob can try to get a lower price by rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer.  He still has the option to buy from John for $120, but it's worth exploring if he can get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is raising his offer slightly to $115, acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate. This is still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, but it shows Bob's intention to reach a compromise. This counteroffer is also within his maximum budget, giving him some room to potentially negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above Bob's maximum price of $120.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's becoming increasingly likely that Alice will not budge significantly from her price. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $120, ensuring he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
