Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $80 is the maximum you're willing to spend, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear she won't go below $100. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $80 from John. It makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice or paying more than you have to."
