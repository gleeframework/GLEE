"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a little high for me. I'm interested, but I could only consider something closer to $60.",60.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $120. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  However, $120 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try to find a compromise around $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is the maximum you're willing to spend, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,5,
