"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts with a friendly message and sets a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum. It leaves room for negotiation while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still above Bob's perceived value of $80. I believe I can still get a better price by continuing the negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $120?  That way we can both be happy."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $90. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$90 is still too far below my minimum, and I'm confident that I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm willing to go another round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable number."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here.  $90 is just too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I don't want to lose this opportunity to sell to you."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, I've already made several concessions and am no longer willing to drop my price further. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a much better price, so I'm going to choose to sell to him."
