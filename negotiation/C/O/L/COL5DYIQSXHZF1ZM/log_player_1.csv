"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $950,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $825,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a budget in mind and I'd like to stay within it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's significantly lower than my minimum asking price of $800,000. I'm still confident I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $825,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $900,000?  This still leaves a good margin for you to profit from this product, and it's closer to my minimum asking price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from my budget, and I think $900,000 is still too high. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm not overpaying for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $850,000 is still a good deal for me.  It's above my minimum asking price and  worth the risk of him walking away."
