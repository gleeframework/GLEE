"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I propose a price of $140 for it. This offer is tailored to provide you with the best possible deal while ensuring a fair return for us. I trust this price will meet your expectations and make this transaction beneficial for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is closer to your maximum budget than her initial value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice that's closer to your desired price range.  If not, you're still saving $20 by going with John."
