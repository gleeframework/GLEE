Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a reasonable starting point, as it allows for potential compromise while still ensuring a profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  $8,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $17,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate, but it still allows me to secure a profit above my minimum acceptable price. I believe this price is fair and could potentially be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still not enough to make the sale worthwhile. I will reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm willing to accept $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I hope Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,000 is still too low.  While it's getting closer to my minimum price, it's not enough to justify the risk of further negotiation. It's time to stop the negotiation with Bob and sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I get my minimum acceptable price and a guaranteed sale."
