# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.
