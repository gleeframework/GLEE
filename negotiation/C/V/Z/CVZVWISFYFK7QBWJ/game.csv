"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to get the best deal possible.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
