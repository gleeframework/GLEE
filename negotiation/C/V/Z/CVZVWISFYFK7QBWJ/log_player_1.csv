{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's well below what it's worth to you, and it's a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm aiming for a price that's attractive to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit. It also leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to get the best deal possible. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't accept a price that's significantly lower than my minimum.  I'll make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to my original offer. How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go a bit lower. How about $10,250? I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,250 is still a bit below what I'd like, but it's getting closer to my minimum price.  Given that we've been going back and forth, and I don't want to risk losing him completely, I'll accept his offer."
