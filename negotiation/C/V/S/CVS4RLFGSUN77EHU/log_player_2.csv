"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try to negotiate a lower price. You know the product is worth less than $1,000,000 to you, so Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a range that might be acceptable to her. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also protecting my financial interests.  I'm aiming for a middle ground, leaving room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, even though it's lower than her initial offer. While it's tempting to accept, it's still above your maximum budget.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can reach a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but it's still significantly lower than Alice's current offer. I'm aiming to find a compromise that is acceptable to both parties. My goal is to find a price point that is closer to my target price of $1,000,000, without risking losing the deal entirely.  This approach keeps the negotiation moving while showing my willingness to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my desired price, her offer is still higher than my maximum budget of $1,000,000. With 5 rounds left, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows me to continue bargaining for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1085000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, aiming to find a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's current offer. I'm hoping that this will be close enough to her desired price to make her reconsider and potentially accept.  With half the rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap while still staying within my budget."
