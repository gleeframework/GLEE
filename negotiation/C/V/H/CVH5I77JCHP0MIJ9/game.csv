"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $120 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's still a great deal for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting close to your budget, but I'm still not willing to go below $110. It's the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",110.0,Alice,5,
