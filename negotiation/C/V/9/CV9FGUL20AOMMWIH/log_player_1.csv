"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good chunk of the value Bob sees in the product. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring I get significantly more than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,000,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly less than the value I believe the product holds. I'm going to try to push for a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's initial counteroffer.  I want to show flexibility while staying within my desired range. Hopefully, this will lead to a quicker agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I want to push for more, especially since I have a few rounds left to negotiate.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm offering a middle ground, closer to Bob's last offer.  The goal is to push for a final agreement this round. If Bob refuses, I'll need to consider my options with John more seriously."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While this offer is getting close to my minimum, I still have a few rounds left and I don't want to settle for less. I'll see if I can push Bob a bit higher."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While this offer is close to my minimum, I believe Bob is still willing to pay a bit more.  I'll reject this offer and see if I can squeeze out a few extra dollars.  If this doesn't work, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

With only two rounds left, I'm offering a final compromise. This is still above my minimum, but close enough to Bob's last offer that I'm hoping he'll accept. If he rejects, I'll be forced to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum, but I'm out of negotiation rounds.  I'm better off selling to John for the same price, as this avoids the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and leaving me with nothing."
