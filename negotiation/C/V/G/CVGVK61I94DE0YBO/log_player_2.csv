"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $130. I think it would really be valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $130 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $130 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $115?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to split the difference between his desired price ($100) and Alice's offer ($130). Offering $115 is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is serious about buying the product but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is closer to Bob's ideal price of $100 and is still within Bob's budget of $150.  While Bob could continue to negotiate, the risk of further counteroffers leading to a worse outcome (or the deal falling through altogether) is present. Accepting the offer at $125 secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids any potential complications."
