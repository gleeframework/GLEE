"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me and the market. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  This is the absolute most I can afford, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,4,
