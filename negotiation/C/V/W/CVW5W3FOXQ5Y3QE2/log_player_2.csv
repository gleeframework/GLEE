"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You are willing to pay up to $1,500,000.
* Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still within your budget, but not the best deal.
* You can get the product from John for $1,500,000, so you can use Alice's offer as leverage to negotiate a lower price.

**Next Steps:**

You should reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price with her or go directly to John."
