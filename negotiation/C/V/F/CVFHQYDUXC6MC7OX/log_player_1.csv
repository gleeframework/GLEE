Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it might be rejected. This allows for room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility and encourage Bob to come up a bit.  I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  At this point, there's a risk of further negotiation lowering the price even more, or of Bob walking away altogether.  It's best to accept his offer and secure a sale."
