Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know this product would be valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Going straight to $15,000 might make Bob feel like he's not getting a deal and could lead to immediate rejection.
* **Secure a Good Alternative:** Knowing John will buy the product for $12,000 provides Alice with a safety net. She can afford to be a bit bolder in her offer to Bob."
