Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it offers.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is above Bob's perceived value of $12,000 but below my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This gives Bob room to counter-offer without me immediately rejecting. 
* **Positive Tone:** My message is friendly and encourages a discussion.  

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counter-offer and decide whether to accept, counter-offer again, or sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiating Position:**  While $13,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate. I'm confident I can get a bit closer to my desired $15,000.
* **Seeking Higher Value:** Bob's counteroffer is a good starting point, but I believe I can squeeze a little more out of the deal. 
* **Avoiding ""Selling Low"":** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'm not willing to settle for a lower price just yet if there's a chance of getting closer to my target.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter-offer Bob with a price slightly higher than $13,000, but still below my minimum of $15,000. I'll aim for a price that's within Bob's range but more advantageous to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, but it still reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  I'm counter-offering with a price that's halfway between Bob's offer of $13,000 and my previous offer of $14,000. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, which makes this a worthwhile negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message remains friendly and encouraging, creating a positive negotiation environment.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this offer, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000.  At this point, I'm closer to my minimum price, so the risk of a lower price is reduced. However, I'll still be willing to negotiate a bit more if there's a chance Bob will come up."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I've carefully considered your latest offer. In order to reach an agreement, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $13,200 for the product. I believe this price respects both the value of the product and our respective positions in the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's counteroffer of $13,200 is very close to my minimum price of $15,000.  There's very little room for further negotiation to get a better price.
* **Time and Effort:**  Further negotiation would likely involve small incremental changes, which would take more time and effort without a significant increase in profit.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, ensuring a solid profit and saving me time and negotiation energy.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll contact John and finalize the sale for $15,000. This is the most efficient way to secure my desired profit."
