Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might go for a slightly lower price, increasing my profit compared to selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing somewhere above my minimum.
* **Urgency and Value:**  Phrases like ""limited time"" and ""great deal"" are subtle ways to nudge Bob towards a decision without being overly pushy. 

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a higher price than my minimum and not losing the guaranteed sale to John."
