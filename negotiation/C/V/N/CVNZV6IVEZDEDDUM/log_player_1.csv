Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. This doesn't mean he won't pay more, but it sets an upper limit on what he *might* be willing to pay.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000. This is your leverage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. Here's the balancing act:

1. **Appear Firm:**  Don't start negotiations with a price close to $800,000. This signals you're willing to settle quickly.
2. **Justify Your Price:** Have a reason for your asking price (even if it's just the product's value to you).  This makes you appear more confident and less likely to drastically lower your price.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $950,000. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:** $950,000 gives you room to negotiate while still aiming for a significant profit.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""confident this is a fair price"" project strength in your position.
* **Focus on Value:** Highlighting ""unique value"" and ""return on investment"" subtly emphasizes what Bob stands to gain.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening move. Be prepared to negotiate!  If Bob counters, be ready to justify your price or potentially come down slightly. Remember, your goal is to get the best possible deal *above* your $800,000 safety net."
