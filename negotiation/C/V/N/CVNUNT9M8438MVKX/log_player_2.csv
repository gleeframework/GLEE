# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1,500,000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000.

At this point, Alice has come down significantly. While I might be able to push for another $10,000 - $20,000, it's getting risky. Accepting at $1,080,000 secures a good deal and avoids the risk of her pulling out of the negotiations completely."
