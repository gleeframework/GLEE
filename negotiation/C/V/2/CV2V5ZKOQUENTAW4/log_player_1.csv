Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I believe it would be a valuable addition to what you already do, and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have.  I'm asking for $115 for it."",
 ""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer slightly higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob specifically can make him more receptive to the price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $115 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Alternative Option:** Keeping in mind John's standing $100 offer provides a safety net and prevents me from accepting a deal below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($100) and the product's value to him ($120). There's ample room for negotiation.  I'll counter-offer in hopes of finding a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob. However, $90 is quite a bit lower than I can consider. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
 ""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By suggesting $105, I'm meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer ($115) and his counteroffer ($90). This shows a willingness to negotiate and can be a persuasive tactic.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is still a good deal for Bob considering the product's worth to him. It also keeps the negotiation above my absolute minimum of $100, providing a buffer if further negotiation is needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is a bit low.  How about $98? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $98 is slightly below my ideal price, it's still a profit and exceeds my absolute minimum of $100.  Continuing to negotiate for a few dollars more might risk losing the sale altogether. Bob's offer at this point represents a reasonable compromise."
