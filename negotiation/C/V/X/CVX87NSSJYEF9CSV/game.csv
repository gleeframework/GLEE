"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While the product sounds interesting, $18000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $15000 for it, as that's my maximum price point. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $15000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $16500. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $16500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15500, which is a fair compromise considering my budget. Let's see if we can close the deal.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $16000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can offer you the product for $16250. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll find it's a great value. What do you think?",16250.0,Alice,5,
