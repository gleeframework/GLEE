"Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its potential value to you will be substantial. Let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1500000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it, considering its potential value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1000000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and allows me to recover a portion of the value I see in this product.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
