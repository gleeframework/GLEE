"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very unique and valuable product I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1500000. This is a significant investment, but I believe its potential value to you will be substantial. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is exactly your maximum budget. There's no room for negotiation, and you have no information about the product's actual value.  Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Gather more information:** You can try to learn more about the product and its potential value through further conversation with Alice.
* **Gain leverage:** By rejecting the initial offer, you signal that you're not desperate and are willing to walk away. This gives you some leverage to negotiate a lower price.
* **Explore other options:**  You can potentially find a better deal with John or even find a different product that aligns with your needs and budget."

{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm intrigued by the product, $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, considering its potential value.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this further."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1000000 is significantly less than what I believe the product is worth, I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1250000. This would still be a significant gain for you, and allows me to recover a portion of the value I see in this product.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant decrease from her initial price and within your budget. 

Here's why accepting is the best option:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be saving $250,000 compared to buying from John.
* **Potential for Value:** You still believe there's potential value in the product, as stated in your counteroffer.
* **Limited Information:** You have no concrete information about the product's actual value to make a more informed decision.

While further negotiation is possible, accepting Alice's offer provides a solid deal with potential for profit."
