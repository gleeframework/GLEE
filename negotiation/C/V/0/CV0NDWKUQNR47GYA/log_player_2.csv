Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, $700,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better offer than Alice's initial price, it's still higher than I'm comfortable paying. I believe I can negotiate a lower price by continuing to counteroffer."
