Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I believe it's important to be ambitious while still being reasonable. I'm also aware that I can always accept John's offer of $15,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. I will counteroffer Bob and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject this offer and make another counteroffer. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price point before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $10,500.  This is a compromise, as it's closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will be enough to get Bob to finally agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I would prefer to get more for the product, it seems like Bob is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, selling to John guarantees me a reasonable profit, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob that might result in an even lower price."
