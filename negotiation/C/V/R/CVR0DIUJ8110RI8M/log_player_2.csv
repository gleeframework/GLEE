"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. You have 10 rounds to negotiate, and you're aiming to save as much as possible. Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to potentially lower the price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm currently prepared to pay.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings to the table is truly significant, and I believe my initial offer accurately reflects that.  I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about we settle on $1,350,000?

```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1,325,000. This price is a fair reflection of the value we both see in this product, and allows for a smooth and mutually beneficial transaction."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and see that you're serious about this purchase. While I believe the product is worth even more, I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal.
