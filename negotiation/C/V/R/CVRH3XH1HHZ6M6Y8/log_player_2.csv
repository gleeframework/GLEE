"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You can do much better than $900,000. You have a maximum budget of $1,200,000 and Alice values the product at $800,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer that might be more appealing to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $900,000, but still leaves some room for profit for Alice.  Since you know Alice values the product at $800,000, this price offers a decent margin above her valuation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $920,000 is closer to your ideal price than Alice's initial offer, it's still too high.  You're still better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate. You have a significant budget advantage, and can likely get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to your ideal price, but you can still push for a lower price. This counteroffer is a modest increase from your previous offer, showing that you're willing to negotiate, but still trying to get the best deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is now higher than your previous counteroffer, and is getting closer to your budget limit.  It's likely that further negotiation won't get you a much lower price, and you risk going back and forth for a long time.  Buying from John, while not your ideal price, is a safer and faster option to get the product."
