"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure I'm fairly compensated for the product's value. I can offer it to you for $1400000. This is a serious offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, Bob, but I'm still not sure if that's the best I can do. I'm going to throw in an additional incentive - I'll include a premium support package worth $20000, which will give you exclusive access to our top-tier customer support for a year. Considering this added value, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand you're still looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1350000. However, I'm willing to throw in one more incentive - a 5% discount on the premium support package, which brings the total value of the package down to $19000. Considering this, I'm still willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere.

"I appreciate the additional incentive, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product, and I'll even accept the premium support package with the 5% discount. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?",1300000.0,Bob,8,
