"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1350000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,350,000. Would you consider reducing the price to $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer and your understanding of the product's value. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. While I understand the value in your product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,275,000. Could we perhaps aim for a price closer to $1,150,000? This would allow us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's try to close this gap.  Would you consider $1,210,000? This is my final offer, as I need to consider other opportunities if we can't reach an agreement.",1210000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your persistence. I've done some research and feel confident in offering $1,180,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair compromise considering the value you're providing. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
