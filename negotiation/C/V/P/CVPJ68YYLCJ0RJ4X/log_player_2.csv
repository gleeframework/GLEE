Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $75?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $125 is still a little steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That's my final offer."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $100. I'm willing to compromise again and offer you the product for $130. It's a fair price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's unlikely Alice will come down to $100.  She's rejected that offer twice now and is holding relatively firm.  It's better to secure the product from John at the desired price than risk further negotiation."
