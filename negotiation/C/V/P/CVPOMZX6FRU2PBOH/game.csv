"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price that still allows you to acquire a valuable product while ensuring I get a reasonable return.  Let's make this happen!",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,050,000.  We're getting closer, but I still need to be closer to my asking price to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's meet halfway, at $1,125,000.  This is a solid deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this agreement. Let's get this done, Bob!",1125000.0,Alice,5,
