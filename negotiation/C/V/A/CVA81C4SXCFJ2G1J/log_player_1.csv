{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100). 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** $140 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, giving him a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal while still allowing me to profit.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to buy.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll be happy to sell the product to him for $140.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth negotiating further, or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price:**  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $100. 
* **Potential for higher profit:**  Even though Bob is interested, I believe I can likely get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my original offer of $140."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about we split the difference at $130? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's work together on this!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between his offer ($120) and my previous offer ($140). This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Positive language:** I'm using positive and encouraging language to keep Bob interested and motivated to reach an agreement. 
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob that the price is still a good deal for him, emphasizing the value of the product.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I'll happily sell the product to him for $130.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price of $100 and my goal of maximizing profit. If his offer is too low, I may choose to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that price. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Bob's offer of $125 is a reasonable compromise and meets my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Maximizing profit:** While I'd ideally prefer my initial asking price of $140, accepting $125 still yields a good profit and is worth more than selling to John for $100.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the deal:** I will accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $125."
