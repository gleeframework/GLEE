"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is significantly higher. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I recognize its value, $750000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $500000.  This is a fair price considering the potential for future negotiation and the fact that I have another offer on the table. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $675000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your initial offer and the potential for future negotiation. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $675000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $600000. This is a fair compromise, considering my initial offer and the fact that I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find common ground.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $600000. Considering the product's true value, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm offering it to you for $650000. This is a fair price, taking into account your initial offer and my own minimum price. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
