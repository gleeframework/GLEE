"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. I believe the product has great potential, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1400000 is significantly less than what I'm aiming for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1550000? This allows me to make a reasonable profit while offering you a fair price.",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider $1450000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product if we can meet at this price.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to see you're serious about acquiring this product.  $1450000 is still a bit below my desired price, but I'm willing to make one final concession. How about we settle at $1500000? This is the absolute lowest I can go, and it still leaves me with a reasonable profit.  Let me know if you're ready to finalize the deal.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
