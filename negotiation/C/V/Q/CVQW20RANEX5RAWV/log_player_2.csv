{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is a good price, it's always beneficial to explore options and see if you can get an even better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me some room to potentially compromise. I believe $5,000 is a reasonable starting point, considering my maximum budget is $10,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, but it's still higher than my desired price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can push her down further.  There are still several rounds left, and I want to maximize my savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $5,500. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm still aiming for a price lower than her current offer.  I believe this is a reasonable compromise, and we're getting closer to a deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her price from the previous round. While it's still within my budget, I'm not willing to pay that much right now. I believe I can still negotiate a lower price, especially since there are several rounds left.  I'll continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price that's more favorable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 5750}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but only slightly to $5,750. This shows Alice that I'm committed to making a deal, but I'm still not willing to meet her price. I'm hoping that by showing a willingness to compromise while also staying firm on my desired price range, I can push Alice towards a more agreeable offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice continues to increase her price, which is frustrating, but I'm still committed to negotiating.  I believe there's still room to lower the price, and I'm not ready to give up on getting a better deal.  Plus, there are still a few rounds left, giving me time to explore different options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 6000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $6,000. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, but I'm still below Alice's current price. I'm hoping to show Alice that I'm getting closer to accepting her price, but I'm not ready to cave in completely. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a balance between pushing for a lower price and closing a deal before I have to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to her initial price, and with only one round left, I'm unlikely to negotiate a lower price.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John. While $10,000 is more than I wanted to spend, it's still within my budget, and I don't want to risk getting stuck without the product."
