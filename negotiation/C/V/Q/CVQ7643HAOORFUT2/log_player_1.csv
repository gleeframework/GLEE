Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000?
