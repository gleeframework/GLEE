"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be incredibly valuable to you. My asking price is $1,000,000, which I believe is fair considering its potential benefits. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a mutually agreeable price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000. There's room for negotiation.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You should make a counteroffer to Alice, aiming for a price closer to your maximum."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the outcome.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider. While I'm open to negotiation, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower my price to $950,000. This leaves room for both of us to walk away feeling satisfied.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your maximum, you're still willing to pay less. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:** There are still 7 rounds remaining, giving you time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:** You should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to your maximum but still higher than Alice's minimum."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm trying to be fair as well.  $950,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and $900,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for.  However, I still need a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still slightly too high:** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $925,000. There's still some room for negotiation.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have 5 rounds remaining. It's worth trying to push for a better deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  $925,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $912,500? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good outcome. Let's close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 912500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise. While I understand your position, $912,500 is still a little lower than I'd like. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $918,750. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's finalize this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $918,750. This is a good deal for you.
* **Limited time remaining:** You only have 3 rounds left. There's a risk that Alice might reject further counteroffers, and you might end up buying from John at a higher price.
* **Slight compromise:** While you can likely get a slightly lower price, the difference is not significant enough to risk losing the deal.

**Next Steps:**  Accept Alice's offer and purchase the product. You've successfully negotiated a good price and saved a significant amount of money."
