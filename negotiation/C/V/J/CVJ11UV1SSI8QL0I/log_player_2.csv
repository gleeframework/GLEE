"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $140, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is still too high. It's time to negotiate and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, which might make her reconsider. However, it's still leaves room for negotiation before reaching my maximum budget of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $125 is within my budget. While I could try to negotiate further, it's not guaranteed Alice will go lower, and I risk losing the deal. It's better to accept this reasonable offer than to risk paying the full $120 to John."
