Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would be very valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."", ""product_price"": 11500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, there's room for negotiation above that price.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays with John or other buyers. 

This offer gives Bob a significant discount while still netting Alice a profit above her minimum."
