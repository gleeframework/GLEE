"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $12500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,3,
