Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum value of $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Positive message:** I'm trying to create a positive and encouraging tone to make Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **No specific details:**  I'm avoiding giving too much information about the product's value to me. I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay before revealing too much. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just a starting point.  The best approach will depend on your understanding of the product's value to Bob and your assessment of his negotiation style. 
*  Keep in mind the risk of losing Bob and having to sell to John for $10,000.  You need to balance potential profits with the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, but it's still below what I'm aiming for.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives me a chance to counter with a higher price. I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a reasonable drop:** I'm not dropping too much from my initial offer, but it shows flexibility.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a great deal, even at the higher price.
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation flowing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $12800 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has come up slightly from his previous offer, and we're now quite close to my minimum acceptable price. While I'd prefer a bit more, it's risky to keep negotiating and risk losing him entirely. Accepting his offer guarantees me a good profit, and avoids having to sell to John at the lower price."
