"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still being a good starting point for me. I'm confident I can get more than my minimum $80, but I don't want to scare him off with a ridiculously high price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm not thrilled with Bob's low offer, I'm not ready to settle for $80 just yet. There's still room to negotiate. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter with $90.  It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's lowball offer.  I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price, but I want to show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $85 is closer to my minimum price of $80, and I'm not sure I can get a better deal with him.  It's also a good price, given that I can sell to John for $80. I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
