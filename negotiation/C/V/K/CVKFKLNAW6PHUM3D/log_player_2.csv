"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I've done my research and I think it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your research.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $875,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for further negotiation. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, and rejecting allows him to try for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $862,500.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 862500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $862,500, which would be $863,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $863,750. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $863,750 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $862,500.  It's a good deal for Bob, considering his maximum budget is $1,000,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John for a higher price is now high.  It's better to accept this offer and secure the product."
