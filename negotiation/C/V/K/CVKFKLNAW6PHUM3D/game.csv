"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this incredible product from me. I've done my research and I think it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $1,000,000 to you. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your research.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider $875,000, which is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and agree on $862,500.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",862500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $875,000 and $862,500, which would be $863,750. This is the best I can do, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",863750.0,Alice,5,
