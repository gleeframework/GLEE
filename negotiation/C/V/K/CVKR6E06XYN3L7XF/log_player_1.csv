Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I'm confident it will be a great asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above your minimum:**  You're ensuring you get more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **Below Bob's maximum:** It leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win situation. 
* **Fair:**  It's a reasonable price that acknowledges the value to Bob while still giving you a good profit.

Remember, the key is to be firm but open to negotiation. You can adjust the price depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $850,000? I'm eager to make this purchase, and I'm confident this price reflects both the value of the product and my willingness to commit to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above your minimum, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and below what you believe the product is worth.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and potentially secure a higher price.  You're still in a strong position, knowing you can always sell to John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit low.  I'm prepared to come down to $900,000. This reflects the value of the product to you and leaves room for a successful partnership.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. Given my budget constraints, I propose $875,000 as the price for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise that respects both the value of the product and my financial situation. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your minimum:** Bob's offer is only $75,000 below your minimum acceptable price. This is a small difference, especially considering the potential risk of further negotiation.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While it's close to your minimum, there is still a small margin for potential negotiation in future rounds.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If you reject this offer, there's a chance Bob will walk away, and you'll be stuck with selling to John at a lower price.

**Overall:**  Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible option at this point. It secures a good price that's close to your minimum, and you can always explore further negotiations in the future if you're feeling bold."
