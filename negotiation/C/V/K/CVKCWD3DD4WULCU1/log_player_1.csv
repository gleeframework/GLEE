I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating.  While I'm getting closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price with more rounds of negotiation. I also want to avoid selling to John just yet, as he's offering my minimum and I'd like to see if I can get a bit more from Bob."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  Bob's offers are getting lower, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm concerned I won't be able to get a better price. John is offering my minimum, which is a safe bet at this point."
