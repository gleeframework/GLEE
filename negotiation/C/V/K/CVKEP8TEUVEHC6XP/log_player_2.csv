The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is selling it for $95. You can try to get a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I had a higher price in mind, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Alice has come down to $90, which is still a good deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $100, and John is selling it for $100. Accepting Alice's offer saves you $10."
