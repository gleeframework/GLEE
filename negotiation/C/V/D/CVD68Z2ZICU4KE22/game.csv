"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",117.5,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not comfortable with $117.50. Let's meet in the middle at $116. This is a fair price that allows both of us to get a good deal.",116.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a little more. How about $116.50? It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it keeps the negotiation moving forward.",116.5,Alice,5,
