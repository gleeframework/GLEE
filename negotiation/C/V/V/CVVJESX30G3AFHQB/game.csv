"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a great deal for both of us, and I think we can close this deal.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $108. Let's split the difference and close this deal.",108.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $108 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $109. This is the best I can do, and I'm confident you'll agree it's a fair price for this fantastic product. ",109.0,Alice,5,
