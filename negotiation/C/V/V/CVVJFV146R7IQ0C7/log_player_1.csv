Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", ""product_price"": 9500} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's still significantly below Bob's perceived value of $8,000. This increases the likelihood of him accepting while securing a healthy profit for me. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, might be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase."
