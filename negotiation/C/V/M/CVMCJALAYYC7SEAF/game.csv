"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this product is worth it to me at that price.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. While I believe this product offers you significant value even at $14,000, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about we settle at $13,750?",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,750 is still a little too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $13,500. This feels like a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
