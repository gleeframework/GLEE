"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price that's a bit lower than its true value. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This is a fair price, considering my maximum budget and your initial offer.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,175,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the initial offers we've discussed.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, considering my budget and your initial offer. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not convinced that $1,100,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a compromise that should satisfy both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price, considering my budget and our previous offers.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you've made a final offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000 is still too low, so I'm going to go a bit higher. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
