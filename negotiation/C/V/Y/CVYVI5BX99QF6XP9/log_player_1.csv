Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $120, aiming slightly lower initially might entice Bob. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $119 is just below your guaranteed price but significantly above Bob's perceived value. There's a chance he might see it as a small enough premium to justify the purchase.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downwards while still staying above your minimum acceptable price."
