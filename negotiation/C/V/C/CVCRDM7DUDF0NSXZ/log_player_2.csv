"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but I can't go as low as $105.  Would you consider meeting me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

``` 
You're still trying to save money but Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price. It's worth accepting before potentially going back and forth further and risking John's offer disappearing."
