"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. This is a competitive price, considering the value it brings to the table. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I see the value in the product, $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway between our offers. How about we settle on a price of $9750? This would still be a good deal for me, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the value the product brings. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While I'm closer to my target, $9750 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $9000 for the product, but unfortunately, I can't go any higher.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to go up to $9000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $9500? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product's value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
