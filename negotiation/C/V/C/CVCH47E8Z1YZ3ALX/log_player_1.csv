Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I see the value in the product, $10500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $8500 for it.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
