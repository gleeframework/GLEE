"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential benefits you've highlighted, $1,800,000 is unfortunately outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which I believe is a fair price considering my own valuation and the potential value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
