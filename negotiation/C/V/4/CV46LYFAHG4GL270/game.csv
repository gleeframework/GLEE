"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering its worth.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This price feels more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counter.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could come down to $1,050,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000, but that's as high as I can go.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is close, but to be completely transparent, I need to get at least $1,000,000 from this sale. This is a firm offer - are you in?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I've already offered $950,000 and you countered with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going above $975,000. This is my final offer.",975000.0,Bob,6,
