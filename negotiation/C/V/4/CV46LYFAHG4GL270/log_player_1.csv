Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I've already offered $950,000 and you countered with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm not going above $975,000. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While selling to John would net you the full $1,200,000, Bob's offer of $975,000 is significantly above his initial offer and demonstrates movement on his part.  Continuing to push for more could result in losing the sale altogether. Accepting this offer represents a strong profit margin, even if it falls short of your ideal target."
