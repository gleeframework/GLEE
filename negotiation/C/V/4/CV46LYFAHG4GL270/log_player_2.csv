Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counter.  I understand your perspective, but $900,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I could come down to $1,050,000.  This is my best offer and reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is close, but to be completely transparent, I need to get at least $1,000,000 from this sale. This is a firm offer - are you in?
