Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential worth to you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, we start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000).
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,300,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control of the process.  
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" and ""potential worth"" subtly justifies the high price without revealing our hand or insulting Bob with a ridiculously inflated number.

This approach aims to maximize profit while maintaining a professional and enticing tone with Bob."
