"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite comfortable with $9,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $9,500. How about $10,250? That's the best I can do.",10250.0,Alice,5,
