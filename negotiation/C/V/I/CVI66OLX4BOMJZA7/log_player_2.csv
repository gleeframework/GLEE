"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for you, as you've mentioned its value to be $1,000,000.  However, if you decline, I'll be selling it to another buyer for a higher price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's worth, you know you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000. Rejecting her offer allows you to pursue that option."
