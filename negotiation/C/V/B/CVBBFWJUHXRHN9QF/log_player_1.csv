"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a high offer, but still below Bob's perceived value. This gives him room to negotiate while still allowing me to maximize my profit. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by highlighting the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my initial one."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $95. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $90 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum, and it's likely Bob won't go any higher.  I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to sell to John for less."
