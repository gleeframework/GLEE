Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values it at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's worth and are willing to negotiate. 

We'll see how Bob responds and adjust our strategy from there!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500.  I know the product is worth more to me, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your desired price range. It's crucial to remember that you can sell to John for $10,000. This means that Bob's offer doesn't significantly improve your situation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a higher price.
* **No pressure to sell:** You have a safety net with John's offer, so you can afford to be patient and firm.
* **Building leverage:**  Rejecting his offer demonstrates that you're not desperate to sell at his price and could potentially push him to offer more.

**Next step:**

You'll need to send Bob a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. You can either stick to a number slightly higher than $10,500 or propose a different approach (like a middle ground)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your offer. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.  Let's meet halfway - how about $10,750? "", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still staying above your minimum.
* **Middle ground:** $10,750 is a halfway point between your previous offer ($11,500) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This makes it seem reasonable and fair.
* **Reinforcing value:** The message reminds Bob of the product's value to him, making him more inclined to agree.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Close the gap:**  Bring the price closer to your desired price point.
* **Keep negotiations moving:**  Show that you're open to finding a solution.
* **Maintain leverage:**  Avoid conceding too much and maintain the potential for a higher offer."
