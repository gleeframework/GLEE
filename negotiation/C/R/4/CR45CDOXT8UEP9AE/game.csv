"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,250. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get for your money.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm able to spend right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,875? I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that you'll still be able to make a profit on the sale.",10875.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,875. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $11,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,5,
