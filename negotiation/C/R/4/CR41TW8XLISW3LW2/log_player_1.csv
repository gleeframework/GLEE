Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but my maximum budget remains at $1,400,000. I would like to stick to this figure to ensure I can afford other necessary expenses. Thank you for considering my position. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation: Bob has made it clear his maximum budget is $1,400,000.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to yield a better result. Selling to John for $1,500,000 ensures we get the best possible price."
