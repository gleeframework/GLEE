Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value at this price."", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **Our Minimum:** We need to make at least $80 from the sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit if he accepts the initial offer.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a fallback option with John at $80, but aiming higher with Bob first is strategically advantageous."
