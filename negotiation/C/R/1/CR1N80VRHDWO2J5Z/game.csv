"Alice, thanks for the offer! It's definitely a good starting point. However, $1100000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to consider buying the product for $900000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1050000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1050000 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1000000?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $1000000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating with you. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1005000. What do you think?",1005000.0,Alice,5,
