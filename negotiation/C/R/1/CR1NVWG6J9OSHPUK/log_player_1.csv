Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm starting high, hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential desire for the product. If he rejects, I can still negotiate down, but I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum price of $150 right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what I'm hoping to get.  I believe I can get closer to my minimum price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to counter with $160. This is still a good profit for me, and I believe it's a reasonable price considering Bob's initial counter-offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more appealing offer for Bob, but I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not ideal, it's still a profit for me and it's better than selling to John. I'm trying to be flexible to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
