It's not worth paying more than $10,000 for the product.  We'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

$11,000 is still more than I'm willing to pay.  I'll counteroffer again."

# Alice's message: Bob, I've made a few concessions already, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10,000, but I need you to throw in something extra. I want you to agree to a 5% service fee on top of the purchase price. This way, I'll still come out ahead. What do you think?

This is getting too complicated. The 5% service fee is an additional cost, and I'm already at my maximum budget. I'll just buy the product from John for $10,000 and avoid the extra hassle."
