"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and my budget.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $950,000 is a significant drop. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand that $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the value of this product is significant, and $975,000 is pushing the lower limits of what I can accept.  My final offer is $1,000,000. This is a firm price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're firm on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $925,000 for the product. I believe this is the highest I can go and still stay within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,6,
