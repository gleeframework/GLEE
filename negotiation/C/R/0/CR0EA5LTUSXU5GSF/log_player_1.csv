**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently unwilling to meet a price point that represents a reasonable compromise.  While continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price than John's offer, it's highly unlikely Bob will reach the $1,000,000 mark.  Accepting John's offer guarantees the best possible outcome for Alice at this stage."
