{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $200. This gives me a good starting point, as it's above my minimum price of $150. I'll see what Bob's response is before deciding whether to adjust my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $150 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $200. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 180}
```

I'm going to counter with $180. This is still a good price for me, and it's hopefully closer to what Bob is willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

Bob's offer of $140 is below my minimum price of $150.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $150."
