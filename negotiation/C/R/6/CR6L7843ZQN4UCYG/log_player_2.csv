"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You should try to get a better price before considering buying from John. 
* **You have 10 rounds.** This gives you time to negotiate and potentially get a much lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000. 
* **Aggressive, but fair:** Offering $850,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for her to make a profit.
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and how far she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While slightly lower than her initial offer, it's still above the $1,000,000 you're willing to pay from John.
* **More room for negotiation.**  Alice rejected your counteroffer, but that doesn't mean she's completely unwilling to compromise.
* **Time is on your side.** You have 7 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer of $850,000 and Alice's current offer of $975,000.
* **Staying within your budget:** $900,000 is still below the $1,000,000 you're willing to pay John, but it's closer to Alice's asking price.
* **Testing Alice's flexibility:** This will show Alice that you're serious about getting a deal, but you're not willing to overpay."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While her offers are coming down, she's still above the $1,000,000 you're willing to pay from John.
* **Time is on your side.** You have 5 rounds remaining. If you keep rejecting, Alice will eventually have to come down further.
* **Don't settle too early.** There's no need to rush into a deal that's not a good one for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:**  This counteroffer is only a $25,000 increase from your previous offer, showing Alice that you're willing to negotiate but only slightly.
* **Pushing the Limit:** $925,000 is still lower than Alice's offer, but it's getting closer to the price John is asking.
* **Time is Running Out:** You have 4 rounds left, so it's time to start pushing for a more favorable price. If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to make a bigger jump in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $995,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer, but still too high.**  While $995,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above what you're willing to pay from John.
* **Two rounds left:** You still have time to negotiate a better price.
* **Pushing for a better deal:** If you reject this offer, Alice will likely have to make a significant concession in the next round to avoid losing the deal.
* **Don't give up.** You're close to a good deal, but don't settle for something that's not in your best interest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Jump:** This counteroffer is a big jump from your previous offer of $925,000. It shows Alice that you're serious about getting a deal, but you're also willing to walk away if she doesn't come down further.
* **Close to the Limit:** $940,000 is only $60,000 below what John is asking, so it's a risky move.
* **Only Two Rounds Left:** With only two rounds remaining, it's time to push for a final price. If Alice rejects this offer, you'll have to decide whether to go with John's offer or risk losing the deal entirely.

This counteroffer is a gamble, but with two rounds left, it's time to take a chance. If Alice accepts, you'll get a good deal. If she rejects, you'll have to make a decision in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **One round left:** This is the final round of negotiation with Alice. 
* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While $990,000 is slightly lower than her previous offer, it's still above your budget and close to what John is asking.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a high risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer in the final round, leaving you with no deal.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** By buying from John, you're guaranteed to get the product for a price that's within your budget. 

It's better to secure the product at John's price than to risk losing the deal altogether with Alice."
