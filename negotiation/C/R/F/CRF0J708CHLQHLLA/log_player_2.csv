Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I still believe the product holds significant value. How about we meet at $825,000? This would be a fair compromise, allowing us to close the deal and both gain from the transaction.  I'm open to your final thoughts on this.

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price above $800,000.  While we could continue negotiating, it's unlikely we'll get a significantly better deal than $825,000. This price represents a decent savings compared to John's offer and allows us to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
