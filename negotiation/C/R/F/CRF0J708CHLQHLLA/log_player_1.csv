"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but I'm working with a tighter budget. How about we start at $700,000 and see where we can meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I reject Bob's offer because $700,000 is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate further but need to stay closer to the product's true value."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $750,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value while making it feasible for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer than before, it's still significantly below the product's worth. I'm willing to continue negotiating, aiming for a higher price that reflects the true value of the product."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm still confident this product is worth more than $750,000.  Let's aim for $850,000. This price represents a solid compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal.  I'm open to discussing further if you have any concerns."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850,000 is getting closer.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? This seems like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While $800,000 is tempting, I believe the product is worth more, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'm confident we can find a mutually acceptable price that reflects its true value."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I still believe the product holds significant value. How about we meet at $825,000?
