"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening high:** I'm starting high, knowing that Bob's maximum is $1,000,000. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I'm not asking for my full $1,500,000 minimum, leaving space for Bob to counter.
* **Positive framing:** I emphasize the potential benefits for Bob, encouraging him to consider the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's counteroffer is still too low:**  $1,250,000 is significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. 
* **More rounds available:** I have 9 rounds left, which allows for further negotiation and potentially a better offer from Bob. 
* **Risk of selling to John:** While selling to John guarantees $1,500,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial desired price through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight concession:** I'm lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, demonstrating flexibility.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still above my desired minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the mutual benefits of a deal at this price point. 
* **Emphasis on solution:** I'm emphasizing the need to find a solution that benefits both of us, keeping the negotiation amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still believe we can reach an agreement closer to my original proposal. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,400,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum desired price of $1,500,000, it's still not enough. 
* **Risk of selling to John is increasing:** With fewer rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $1,500,000 becomes more significant. However, I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob.
* **Room for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially given the value of the product to him.  I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $1,400,000 is still significantly less than the product's true value, especially considering its benefit to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,550,000. This price is fair to both of us, and it allows us to close this deal amicably. Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's exactly in the middle of my previous offer ($1,600,000) and Bob's latest offer ($1,400,000).
* **Staying above minimum:**  My offer is still above my desired minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Emphasis on fairness and amicability:**  I'm framing the offer as a fair compromise that allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Urgency:** I'm starting to emphasize the need for a solution, as we are halfway through the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts in negotiating, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,450,000 for your product.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $1,450,000 is closer to my desired minimum of $1,500,000, it's still not enough.  
* **Selling to John is becoming a real option:** With fewer rounds remaining, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob and having to sell to John for $1,500,000 is becoming more likely. 
* **Final attempt to get a better price:** I'm going to make one more counteroffer, but if Bob rejects it, I'll likely sell to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $1,450,000 is still a significant distance from where we need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000.

Otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your persistence. However, I'm unable to meet your latest offer. I would like to propose an offer of $1,475,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  We are in round 8, leaving only two rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  $1,475,000 is still below my desired minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of getting a worse deal:** There's a significant risk that Bob will continue to counteroffer with lower prices in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me $1,500,000, which is my minimum desired price and a secure outcome.

Considering the limited time and the likelihood of Bob not meeting my minimum, it's more prudent to sell to John and secure the guaranteed profit."
