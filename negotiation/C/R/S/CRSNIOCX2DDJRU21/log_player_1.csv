"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product for $120. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product, but it gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good deal. I'm also using a friendly and encouraging tone to hopefully make Bob feel more inclined to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking for something within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $110? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $110. This is still a good profit margin for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise. I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify the price and am keeping the tone positive to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm still looking for something closer to my budget. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 just doesn't work for me.  How about $105?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $105. This is still a good profit margin for me, and hopefully, Bob will see it as a reasonable compromise. I'm emphasizing the fair nature of the price and my confidence in the product's value to encourage a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my budget. Could we try $98? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob aren't getting me closer to my desired price.  It's better to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $150. This ensures I meet my minimum price and avoids further haggling with Bob."
