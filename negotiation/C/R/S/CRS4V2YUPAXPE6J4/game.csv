"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to offer $11,500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",11500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,500 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, how about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you considering the value you place on the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $12,500. I'd like to make another counteroffer. How about $12,000? I think this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",12000.0,Bob,4,
