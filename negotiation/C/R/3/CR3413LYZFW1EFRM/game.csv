"Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a great deal to me.  I'm willing to let it go for $1500000.  This is a significant investment, but I believe the potential return will be well worth it.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1200000 is still below what I need to let this product go.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's make a deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
