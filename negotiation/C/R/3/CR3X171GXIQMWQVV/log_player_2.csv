"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* Accepting this offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you could try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's a risk she might refuse. Accepting this offer guarantees you get the product below your maximum budget."
