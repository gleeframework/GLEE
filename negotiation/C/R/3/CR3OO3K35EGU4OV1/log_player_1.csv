"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm not going too high right away, as I don't want to scare Bob off."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum of $100, I believe I can get closer to my initial asking price with further negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet as there's still potential for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm offering $140. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise, and I'm confident that I won't get a significantly better offer from Bob. I'm also worried that if I keep rejecting his offers, he might get frustrated and walk away, leaving me with no choice but to sell to John for a lower price."
