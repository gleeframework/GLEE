"I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $130. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? Let's see if we can make this work.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer it to you for $125. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price again. I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my budget. How about $122? It's just a few dollars away from your offer, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",122.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125.50. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",125.5,Alice,7,
