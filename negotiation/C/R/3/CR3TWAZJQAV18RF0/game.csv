"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  However,  $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $105 is closer, but I'm aiming for something a bit lower. How about $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $95.  How about we split the difference and go with $100?  This is my final offer, and it's a fair price for a product that's worth more than that to me.",100.0,Alice,5,
