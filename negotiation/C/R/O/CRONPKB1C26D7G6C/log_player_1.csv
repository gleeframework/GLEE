Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible, as that's what John will pay. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially getting me closer to $120.
* **Appearing Reasonable:** Offering a price just slightly below my guaranteed sale price makes it seem like I'm giving Bob a good deal, increasing the chance he'll accept."
