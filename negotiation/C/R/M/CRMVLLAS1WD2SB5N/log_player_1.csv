Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** $95 is less than what Bob is willing to pay ($100). 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a bit of wiggle room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is more than John's offer, it's still below your minimum acceptable price of $80.  You can likely get a better price from Bob, so rejecting his offer and counteroffering makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate you're interested in the product. I'm willing to go down to $90, but I can't go any lower than that.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $87 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $87 is still below your ideal price, it's above your minimum and John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer, and it's unlikely you'll get much more from him.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
