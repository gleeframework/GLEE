"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,000,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a good compromise considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's value and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit below what I'm aiming for. How about we split the difference and settle on $935,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal. What do you say?",935000.0,Alice,5,
