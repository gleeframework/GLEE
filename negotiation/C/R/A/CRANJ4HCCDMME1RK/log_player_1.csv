I'm offering the product to Bob for $170. This is above his perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point, considering my minimum selling price is $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum selling price of $150. I'm not willing to sell it for less than that, so I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}

I'm offering a slight reduction from my initial price, but still above Bob's offer.  This demonstrates flexibility, but also maintains a price point closer to my desired minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json

```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. Given John is willing to pay my minimum, I'll sell to John to guarantee I get my desired price."
