"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $9500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",9000.0,Alice,3,
