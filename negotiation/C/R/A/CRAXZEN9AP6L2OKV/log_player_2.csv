# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still possible to get a better deal.  You have a solid backup option with John, so there's no pressure to accept immediately.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me.  However, $9500 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,000? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}

# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.
