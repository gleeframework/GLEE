"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to consider my costs and the value I bring to the table. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my best price, but I think you'll find it's still a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for my budget.  How about we settle at $9,000? I believe that's a fair price.",9000.0,Bob,4,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I've already compromised significantly. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,200. I'm willing to come down to $9,800, which is a significant concession from my initial price. This is my best offer, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product.",9800.0,Alice,7,,
