{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140 for it, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also shows I'm interested in a fair deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit too steep for me right now. Would you consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm willing to negotiate but I won't go below my minimum of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125, which is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $150 to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 125}
