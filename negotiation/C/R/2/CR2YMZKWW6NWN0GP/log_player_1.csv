Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $10,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept immediately if he's highly motivated. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the product is worth at least $10,000, I'm anchoring Bob's perception of the value.
* **Urgency:** Creating a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'm secure knowing John will purchase it at my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while still ensuring a sale."
