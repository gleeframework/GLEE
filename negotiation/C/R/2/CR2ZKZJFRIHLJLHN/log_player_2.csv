"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He's willing to pay up to $120, and there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. Would you be willing to do $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $108. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $108, which is within Bob's budget and only $8 more than what Alice values the product at.  This is a reasonable deal for both parties. While Bob could potentially get a slightly lower price, the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of having to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential savings."
