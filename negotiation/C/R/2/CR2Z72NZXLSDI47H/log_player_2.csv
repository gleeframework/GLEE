"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high, considering it's only worth $8,000 to her. There's a good chance of negotiating a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to anchor the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening price. By starting low, I might be able to secure a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500 to make this deal work.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $8,500 is still a significant markup from her $8,000 valuation. There's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
``` 

This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer and Alice's current price. It shows a willingness to negotiate towards a mutually agreeable price while still aiming for a significant discount."
