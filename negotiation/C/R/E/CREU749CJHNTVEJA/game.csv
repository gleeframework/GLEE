"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $10,500? This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,
