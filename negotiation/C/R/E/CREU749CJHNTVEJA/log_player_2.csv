Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $9,000. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to accept $10,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to meet you in the middle. How about we settle at $10,500? This is my final offer, and I think it's a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal. Alice is firm on her price, and it's close enough to my target to make it worthwhile.  I'll accept and avoid the risk of the price going up or losing the deal entirely."
