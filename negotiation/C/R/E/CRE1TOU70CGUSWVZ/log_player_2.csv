"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is only slightly above Bob's maximum value, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000, even though she's moved closer.  Bob can still potentially negotiate a lower price, and there are several rounds remaining.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $10,800 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $10,250.  This is a fair price considering I'm paying more than John's offer, and it would give you a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,600 is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum value of $10,000. Bob has already indicated he's willing to pay more than John's offer, so he's not under pressure to immediately accept. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,600 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $10,400. This price is fair for both of us, and it keeps me from needing to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 10400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,400. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,550. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,550. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,550
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,550 is still above Bob's maximum value of $10,000. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of negotiating a lower price are slim.  It's more beneficial for Bob to accept John's offer and secure the product for $10,000, ensuring he saves money and doesn't risk losing out on the product entirely."
