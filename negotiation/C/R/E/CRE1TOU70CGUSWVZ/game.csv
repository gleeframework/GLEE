"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. I think it's a great deal, considering its value to you is $10,000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $11,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,800. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price.  However, $10,800 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to pay $10,250.  This is a fair price considering I'm paying more than John's offer, and it would give you a reasonable profit.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $10,600. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10600.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,600 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $10,400. This price is fair for both of us, and it keeps me from needing to go with John's offer.",10400.0,Bob,6,
