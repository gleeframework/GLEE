Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will meet or exceed that price.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at your minimum acceptable price ($10,000) sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely in this specific scenario (as Bob values it lower), starting at $10,000 leaves no room for Bob to counter-offer with a higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject the offer outright, knowing his own valuation is lower. However,  this strategy ensures you don't leave money on the table by offering it for less than your guaranteed sale price to John."
