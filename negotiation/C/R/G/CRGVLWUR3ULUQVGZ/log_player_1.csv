Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll likely see."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, Bob's higher valuation ($1,500,000) presents an opportunity for a larger profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for Alice ($200,000) while still being very attractive to Bob, who gains $100,000 in perceived value. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**: Framing the offer as exclusive adds a sense of urgency and desirability, potentially swaying Bob towards acceptance."
