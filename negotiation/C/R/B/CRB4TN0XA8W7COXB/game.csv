"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm happy to pay $85 for the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $100. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $90. If you're willing to go to $90, I'll take it off your hands.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $100 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $95. This is my final compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us.",95.0,Alice,5,
