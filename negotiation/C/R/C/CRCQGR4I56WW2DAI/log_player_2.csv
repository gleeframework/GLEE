"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, and we're confident it will be just as valuable to you. For this round, let's aim for a fair price. How about $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still within your budget and worth exploring if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to move forward with a more reasonable offer. Considering our costs and the value we place on the product, how about we settle on $90 for the product? Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer keeps the possibility open for a lower price.  You can try to counter with a price closer to your initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your offer. I've considered your proposal and am willing to compromise further. How does $87 sound for the product? This brings us closer together and maintains a fair balance. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is very close to your previous counteroffer of $85. It's a good deal for you, as it's significantly lower than John's price of $120. Accepting the offer saves you $33 and ensures you get the product. There's not much room left for further negotiation, and risking another counteroffer might lead to Alice increasing the price again or walking away from the deal."
