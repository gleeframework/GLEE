Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower offer ($11,500) leaves space for Bob to counter-offer while still securing a good deal for you.
* **Secure a Sale:**  Offering a price too close to $12,000 might deter Bob. A slightly lower price increases the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so there's less risk in aiming higher with Bob."
