Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:**  $10,000 is a fair price considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's offer is closer to your minimum ($8,000) than your initial offer.  
* There's still room for negotiation, as he values the product at $12,000.
* Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $9,750. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is halfway between my previous offer of $10,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500. 
* **Still above minimum:**  $9,750 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000, so it's a good deal for me.
* **Leaving room for agreement:**  There's still a small margin for negotiation, which could potentially lead to a final deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,750, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,200 is only $200 less than my minimum acceptable price of $9,000. 
* **Risk of losing a deal:** If I reject his offer, there's a chance he might walk away, and I'd be left with only the option to sell to John for $8,000.
* **Time consideration:**  Further negotiation could drag the process out, potentially costing me time and effort. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale at a price that is very close to my minimum."
