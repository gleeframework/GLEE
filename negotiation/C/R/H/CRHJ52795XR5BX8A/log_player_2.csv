Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know your thoughts!

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? That feels like a fair price that acknowledges its value."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,100,000 is simply too low.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $1,250,000? This takes into account your needs and my value for the product. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,250,000 is closer, but still a touch high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000? I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1175000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 isn't quite enough for me.  Let's aim for $1,225,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's worth while staying within your budget.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000

It's time to switch tactics. Alice is unlikely to go below $1,200,000 and we have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice and risk paying more."
