"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products and the value I'll be getting from this product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $950000. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $980000.

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $980000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1030000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1030000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to meet you at $1030000. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $960000, but I need you to throw in some extras to make it worth my while. I'm thinking of a 2-year warranty, a free maintenance package, and a 5% discount on any future purchases from you. Can you consider this offer?",960000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your request for extras, but I'm not willing to include a 2-year warranty and a 5% discount on future purchases. However, I'm willing to throw in a free maintenance package for a year. I'm also willing to meet you at $970000, which is a compromise from my previous offer. What do you think?",970000.0,Alice,9,

"Alice, I appreciate the free maintenance package, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980000, but I need you to throw in a 2-year warranty, just like I originally requested. If you can agree to that, I'll consider your offer. Otherwise, I'll have to walk away. Can you reconsider?",980000.0,Bob,10,
