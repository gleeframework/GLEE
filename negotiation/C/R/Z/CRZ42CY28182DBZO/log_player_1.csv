"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value, hoping to capture a large portion of the potential profit. 
* **Guaging Interest:** This initial offer will give me a good idea of Bob's seriousness and his perceived value of the product. 

**Strategy:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response to this initial offer. If he counteroffers, I will adjust my strategy based on his offer. I will also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 at any time if the negotiations with Bob seem to be dragging on or failing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's counteroffer is already closer to my minimum value, but it's still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's room for further negotiation and potentially reaching a price closer to my desired target.

**Strategy:**

I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, attempting to bridge the gap between our positions. I will aim for a price between $1,200,000 and my initial offer of $1,500,000, keeping in mind the possibility of selling to John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,400,000 represents a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still maintaining a significant profit margin for myself. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate further and see if he's truly interested in closing the deal.

**Strategy:**

I'm cautiously optimistic that this counteroffer will be accepted. If Bob rejects it again, I will re-evaluate my strategy and consider lowering my price further or, if the negotiations seem to be stalling, I will take the guaranteed $1,000,000 offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is significantly closer to my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Time is Money:**  We are already four rounds into the negotiation, and with ten rounds total, there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or result in a lower price.

**Strategy:**

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether. The time factor and the possibility of a lower price in future rounds make accepting Bob's offer the most logical choice at this stage."
