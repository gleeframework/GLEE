"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  How about we settle somewhere around $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you think the price is a bit high, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make $1,050,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we settle at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I see the value in the product, $950,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $875,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Bob,4,
