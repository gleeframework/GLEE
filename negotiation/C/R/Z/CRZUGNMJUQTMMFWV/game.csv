"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in the product while still allowing you to make a decent profit. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,125,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
