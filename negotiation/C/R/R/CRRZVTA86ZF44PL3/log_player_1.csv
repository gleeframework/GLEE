"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product sounds interesting, but I was hoping for a price closer to $150. Can we work towards a mutually beneficial agreement? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to go down to $150, I believe the product is worth more than that, and I'm not willing to give it up for that price just yet. I'm going to see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $150 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about we split the difference and go with $175?  This would still be a great price for you and allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 175}
