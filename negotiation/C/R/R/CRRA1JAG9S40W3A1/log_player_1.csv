Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $17,000. This is a starting point that's above my minimum value of $15,000, leaving room for potential negotiation.  It's also within a reasonable range for Bob, as he values the product at $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum value, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price of $17,000.  I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with $16,500. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer and his counteroffer. I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still securing a better price than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is only $500 less than my initial offer, and it's getting closer to my desired price.  Given that John is only offering $15,000, I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the best possible price at this point."
