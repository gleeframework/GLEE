Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the minimum:** I know I have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 from John, so I shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) allows room for negotiation.  
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (""significant value"") might make Bob more receptive. 

**Important Note:** While I'm aiming high, there's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. Gauging Bob's potential interest beforehand would be ideal in a real negotiation."
