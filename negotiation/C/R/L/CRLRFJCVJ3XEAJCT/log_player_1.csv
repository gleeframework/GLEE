Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still gives you a good value, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a better deal.  I have 6 more rounds to try and close this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my asking price, but $950,000 is still not enough. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this work. Let's meet in the middle at $1,025,000. This is my final offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1,025,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle one more time. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $980,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have 4 more rounds left. I'm going to hold out and try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $980,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise.  If you can go up to $1,000,000, we can close this deal.  This is my last offer before I consider other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not willing to go up to $1,000,000. I've already told you that's my limit is $980,000. I'm not going to go any higher. I'm starting to think I should just buy it from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd like to get more from Bob, the negotiation is getting difficult, and I only have two more rounds. I'm running out of time to secure a better deal. Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
