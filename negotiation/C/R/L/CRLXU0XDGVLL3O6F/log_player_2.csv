The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is too high. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice is not willing to come down to a price that is acceptable. It's time to cut my losses and buy the product from John for $1,200,000.  While I'd prefer to save even more money, it's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice."
