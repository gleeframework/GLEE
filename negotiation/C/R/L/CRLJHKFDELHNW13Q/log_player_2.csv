"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is less than the $150 John is asking, it's still more than the product is worth to you ($150). You have room to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is still a good deal for Alice since it's above her valuation of $120. This offer leaves room for further negotiation if needed, but it's a good starting point for getting a lower price than Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $145 is still higher than my desired price. I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Alice, as the product is only worth $120 to her.  While I can buy from John for $150, there's still a chance to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice rejected my previous offer of $130, I'm increasing my offer slightly to $135. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet her halfway. It's still a good deal for Alice as it's higher than her valuation of $120.  I'm hoping this will be enough to convince her to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $142 is still slightly higher than my desired price, but it's getting closer to my limit of $150. I've already made two counteroffers, and it's possible that further negotiations might not lead to a lower price. To avoid risking further negotiation and potentially losing the product to John, I'll accept Alice's offer and purchase the product for $142."
