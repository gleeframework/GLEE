{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of maximizing your profit. Here's why:

* **It's a good deal for Bob:** Bob values the product at $15,000, so he's still getting a good deal at $14,000. He has a strong incentive to accept.
* **It's a good deal for you:**  You get $2,000 more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **It's a strategic middle ground:** By offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value, you increase the likelihood of him accepting, while still securing a healthy profit."
