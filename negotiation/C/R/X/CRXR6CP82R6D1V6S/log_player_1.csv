Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $20,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes it more likely you'll secure a price above your fallback option.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's willingness to pay $20,000 will give you insight into his perceived value. If he accepts, you've maximized your profit. If he rejects, you can still negotiate down or sell to John without losing anything.
* **Confident Presentation:** Highlighting the product's value to Bob reinforces his potential gain and justifies the higher price. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. If his counteroffer is still above $15,000, it might be in your best interest to accept."
