Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I've carefully considered its worth, and I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its potential value to you."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum price.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering a price close to his valuation ($925,000) significantly increases the chances of Bob accepting. This allows us to maximize our profit compared to selling to John. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves a slight margin for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down."
