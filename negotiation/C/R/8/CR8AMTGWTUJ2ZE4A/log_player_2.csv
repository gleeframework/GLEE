While closer, $120 is still significantly more than I'm willing to pay. I'll counter and see if Alice is willing to come down further."

{
""message"": ""I understand this is a good product Alice, and I'm willing to pay a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?"",

It seems like Alice won't budge much lower than $100.  At this point, it's not worth the hassle of continuing the negotiation. I'll take John's offer of $80."
