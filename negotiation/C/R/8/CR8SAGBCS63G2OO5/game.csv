"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $12,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $9,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's within my budget. Let's try to reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $10,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to offer $9,500 as a final compromise. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to explore other options. ",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $10,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept for this product.

"I understand that you're sticking to your budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $10,000. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer it to you for $10,100. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",10100.0,Alice,9,
