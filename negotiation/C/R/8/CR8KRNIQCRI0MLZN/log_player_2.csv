"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a great deal considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice to get a lower price, even if it means potentially going through multiple rounds of offers and counteroffers.  The product is worth $1,200,000 to you, so there's room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a good deal for you, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target of $1,200,000.  It's worth continuing to negotiate. There's still potential to get a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,325,000 is a good compromise for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $1,337,500. This is the best price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,337,500.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,337,500 is still a bit higher than your ideal price, it's a good compromise. You've already negotiated down a significant amount from Alice's initial offer, and further negotiation might lead to a prolonged process that could ultimately lead to you buying from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer allows you to acquire the product for a reasonable price without risking a more costly outcome."
