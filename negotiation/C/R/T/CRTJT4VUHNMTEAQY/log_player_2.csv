You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You're trying to save money, and $1,150,000 is still above your target. Reject the offer and see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This still gives you a significant discount on the value you place on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

While $1,100,000 is closer to your target, you can still try to push for a lower price.  Reject the offer and see if you can negotiate further."
