"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $130. I think it would be a great fit for you and I'm happy to answer any questions you might have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason:  While $130 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by counter-offering.  He's willing to pay up to $150, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $120.  Would you be willing to go that low?"", ""product_price"": 120}
