Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a good starting point as it's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is polite and invites Bob to engage in the conversation. 

This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit.  I'm prepared to adjust my price based on his response and the possibility of counteroffers. Remember, I have the option to sell to John at any time for $1,500,000, giving me a strong negotiation position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a drastic discount. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better price.  I'm confident I can get a higher price from Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for my desired amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering your valuation and my minimum price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,100,000:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's current proposal. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is respectful but firm, acknowledging Bob's perspective while emphasizing my need for a higher price. It also invites further negotiation, indicating my desire to reach a mutually agreeable solution.

By offering a counteroffer, I'm trying to:

* **Bridge the gap:**  Move closer to Bob's desired price without sacrificing too much of my own profit potential.
* **Maintain control:**  Demonstrate my commitment to negotiating while reminding Bob that I have alternative options (selling to John).
* **Increase the chances of a deal:**  Show flexibility and willingness to work with Bob, potentially leading to a successful agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $950000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a slight improvement over Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made substantial concessions, and Bob's statement that this is his ""final offer"" indicates a lack of willingness to continue negotiating.  

Given my alternative option of selling to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000, there's no reason for me to risk further negotiation with Bob.  I'm confident that selling to John will secure the best possible outcome for me."
