"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I propose a price of $100. I believe this offers a fair compromise while ensuring we both benefit from the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $100 is better than Alice's initial asking price of $120, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is a bit tighter than $100. I'd be willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. Given your offer, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit for me while still being a good deal for you. I hope you'll consider this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Since Bob can get the product for $80 from John, it's still worth rejecting Alice's offer and continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to meet you halfway at $87.50. This is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. I hope you'll find this offer acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $87.50, Bob can still get the product for a lower price from John.  There are only 5 rounds left, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower than $85, which is Bob's previous counteroffer.  It's more efficient to take the guaranteed lower price from John at this point."
