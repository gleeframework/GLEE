"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, my budget is a bit tighter than $100. I'd be willing to pay $85, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a solution that works for both of us. Given your offer, I propose a price of $90 for the product. This allows for a reasonable profit for me while still being a good deal for you. I hope you'll consider this proposal.",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $90 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $85.  This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's see if we can make this work.",85.0,Bob,4,
