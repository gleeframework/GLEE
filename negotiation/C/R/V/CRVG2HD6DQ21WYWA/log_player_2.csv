"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob is looking to save money, and Alice's initial offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and hopefully get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save money and $11,000 is still too high.  He should try to get a lower price by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would be a fair deal for both of us, and we could close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I think the product's value is worth more. I'll offer it to you for $11,200. This is a fair price considering the product's quality and what I'm willing to walk away from. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has been negotiating, but Alice's offer is still higher than what he's willing to pay.  He's also run out of time, as he's already used 5 rounds of negotiation.  Buying from John for $10,000 guarantees he gets the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation."
