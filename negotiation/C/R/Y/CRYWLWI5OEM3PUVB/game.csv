"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking $200 for it. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $80 for it.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $80 is far too low for me. This product is really high-quality, and I'm confident it's worth more. How about we meet in the middle at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm firm on $80, but I'm willing to go up to $100 if you're open to it.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your offer, I can't go below $130. This is a final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,5,
