,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a deal, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1,025,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to pay for the product, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
