"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price is within my budget and fair considering the value we both see in it. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850000 is still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $950000. It's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away satisfied. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a good price, but $950000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900000, which I believe is a fair compromise, allowing both of us to make a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900000 is closer, I'm still a bit short of my goal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $925000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, and it ensures we can both get what we want. Let's close this deal!",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  $925000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my budget. I'm willing to go up to $910000, which I think is a fair final offer. This would let us both walk away satisfied with a good deal. What do you say?",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, and I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm offering you the product for $915000. This is the best I can do, and it's still a good deal for both of us. Let's finalize this and avoid further back and forth.",915000.0,Alice,7,
