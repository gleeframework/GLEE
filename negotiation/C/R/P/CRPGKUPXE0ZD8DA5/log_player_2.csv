"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I believe it's worth every penny. I'm starting with a price of $11,000, which is a fair offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing negotiations.  There's a good chance Alice will lower her price to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to come down to $10,800. I believe this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price of $11,000 to $10,800. This is a good deal for Bob, as he can get the product for less than his maximum budget of $12,000. While he could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice refusing to budge makes accepting the offer the best option."
