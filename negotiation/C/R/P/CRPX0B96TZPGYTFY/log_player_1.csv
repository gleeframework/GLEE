Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the unique features of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It makes the most sense to secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John at this point."
