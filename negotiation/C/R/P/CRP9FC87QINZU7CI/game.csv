"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the unique value of this product, $999000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for it.  What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two numbers. How about $925000? It's a fair price considering the product's unique value and the effort I put into it.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $925000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and settle on $887500.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my budget.",887500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $887500. Considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $887500. How about $906250? It's a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and shows my willingness to compromise.",906250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see your point, and I'm willing to come up a little higher.  However, $906250 is still beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle again and settle on $896875?  This would be a fair compromise, acknowledging the unique value of your product while staying within my price range.",896875.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $896875 is a fair price for the product. Considering the value it brings and the negotiations we've had so far, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $912500? It's a fair price that acknowledges the product's unique value and shows my willingness to compromise.",912500.0,Alice,7,
