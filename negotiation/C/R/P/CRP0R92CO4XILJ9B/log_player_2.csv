"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, Bob can likely get a better deal by rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering.  He knows the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to work with me. I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to offer $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $12,500. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his ideal price, he knows he can likely get it for lower by continuing to negotiate. There's still room for Alice to come down a bit more."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about $12,750?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,750 is a good compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $13,200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been steadily negotiating down the price, and Alice is now very close to his ideal price. He knows that Alice's minimum is likely near $12,000, so $13,200 is a reasonable compromise.  While he could try to push for a lower price, there's a risk that Alice will walk away or hold firm, leading him to have to buy from John for a much higher price. It's better to secure the product at a decent price rather than risk losing the deal entirely."
