"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to leave room for negotiation, but still aiming for a good profit.  It's important to be friendly and inviting to get Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but my budget allows me to spend up to $90 for it. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer and see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. While $90 is a good offer, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $100. How about $95? I'm sure we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $92 for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$92 is very close to my desired price, and with limited rounds remaining, it's a good deal. I'd rather secure the sale now than risk getting a lower offer or running out of time."
