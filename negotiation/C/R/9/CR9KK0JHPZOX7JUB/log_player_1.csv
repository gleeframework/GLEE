Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3

This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,400,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,400,000 is closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we settle on $1,450,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
