"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it gives you a good deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my range, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high.  How about we split the difference and I offer $1,400,000?  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1,400,000 is closer, but I still need to make a reasonable profit.  How about we settle on $1,450,000?  This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend right now.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can come to an agreement on this.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
