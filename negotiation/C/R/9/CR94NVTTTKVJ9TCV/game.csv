"I appreciate the discount, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal considering the value you'll get from this product. It's a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not getting anywhere. I'm going to make one last counteroffer before I have to seriously consider selling to John. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price given your budget constraints.  If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to move on to other buyers.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make one last offer, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,150,000 is too high, I'll go as high as $1,180,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1180000.0,Bob,6,
