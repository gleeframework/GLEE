Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the value of the product, potentially justifying the higher price in Bob's mind. 
* **Leaving Room:** Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially landing on a price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could also try a different approach, like offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value to increase the likelihood of a quick sale."
