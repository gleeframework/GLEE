,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there yet. How about we meet in the middle at $105? That would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still giving you a good deal on the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to consider $100 as the maximum price for this product?",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're sticking to $100, and I appreciate your persistence.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $110. This is really my final offer, as it's getting close to my minimum.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",110.0,Alice,5,
