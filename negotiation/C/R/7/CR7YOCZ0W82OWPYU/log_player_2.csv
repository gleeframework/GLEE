Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't sell this product for less than its true value. Let's find a middle ground: $1,000,000. This acknowledges the value while still offering you a significant return on your investment. What do you say?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be frank, I have other potential buyers showing strong interest, but I believe in giving you a fair chance. My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant discount from my initial asking price, and I believe it's more than reasonable given the value you'll receive.  Let me know your decision soon so we can both move forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000. Her language suggests she has other buyers and this is her ""final offer.""  While you could try to negotiate further, you risk her accepting another offer.  Buying from John at $800,000 guarantees you get the product within your budget."
