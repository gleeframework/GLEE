"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,600,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite high. I'm interested, but I'd need a price closer to $800,000 to make this work."",
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

This counter-offer achieves a few things:

* **Signals Serious Interest:**  We don't want to scare Alice away with an extremely low offer initially.  Showing we're willing to negotiate within a reasonable range keeps the conversation going.
* **Establishes an Anchor:**  By starting significantly lower than our true maximum, we aim to pull the negotiation closer to our desired range.  Even if Alice doesn't meet us at $800,000, it gives us room to move upwards.
* **Leaves Room for Concessions:** A successful negotiation involves give-and-take. This offer acknowledges that we're willing to pay a fair price, but it also sets a clear starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I'm motivated to sell, $800,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you consider $1,400,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

Alice came down slightly, but we're still far from a reasonable price. We need to signal that while we're willing to negotiate, we also have alternatives (John's offer).  Rejecting this offer encourages her to move more significantly towards a price we can accept."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have to be mindful of my budget.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can justify. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.  Otherwise, I may need to explore other options."",

**Strategy Explanation:**

* **Reveal your maximum:**  By now, it's strategic to show our hand. This signals to Alice that we're serious and not just lowballing for the sake of it.
* **Deadline Implication:**  The phrase ""explore other options"" subtly reminds Alice of John's offer without directly referencing it. It creates a sense of urgency. 
* **Clear Call to Action:**  We're giving Alice a clear choice: either accept our final offer and close the deal or risk losing the sale.

This approach aims to get us the best possible outcome. If Alice truly values the sale, she might accept our maximum price. If not, we're still protected by John's backup offer."
