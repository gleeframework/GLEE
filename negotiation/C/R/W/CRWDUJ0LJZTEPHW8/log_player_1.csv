"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm taking a chance he might be willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum desired price.  While it's tempting to accept and avoid further negotiation, I'm confident the product is worth more. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent profit. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price. While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to push the price higher."
