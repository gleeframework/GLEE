"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is also lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try to find a compromise around $11,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is not significantly budging from her initial offers. She's gone up in price from round 3 to 5 which is a bad sign. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price point that makes sense for you within the remaining rounds.  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal from John at $8,000."
