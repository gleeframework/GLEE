"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer you a price of $18,000 for the product. This is a competitive price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a limited budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but $9,000 is also lower than the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum requirements.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. How about we try to find a compromise around $11,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you a price of $16,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",16000.0,Alice,5,
