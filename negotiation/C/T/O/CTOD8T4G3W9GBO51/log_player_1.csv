Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'd agree. To kick things off, I'd like to propose a starting price of $1,000,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. My counteroffer for the product is $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

We're still significantly above John's offer, so there's room for negotiation. Let's see if we can get Bob closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000? This reflects its true worth while recognizing your interest."",

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. Considering the current market conditions and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a revised offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a bit more, $950,000 is a strong offer and well above our minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely in further negotiation."
