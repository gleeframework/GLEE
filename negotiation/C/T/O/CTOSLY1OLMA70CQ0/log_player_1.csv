Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's maximum:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000, but that doesn't mean he's willing to pay that much.  
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a price of $19,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($15,000).
* **Backup offer:** You have the security of John's offer ($15,000), so you're not desperate to accept a low price from Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value might be even higher elsewhere (""list it publicly"").

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Bob's response might lead to a counter-offer or further negotiation."
