It's a great deal at $500,000, but I can likely get a better price by negotiating with Alice."

I'm going to start with a low offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $300,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $350,000, which is a good compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one.  This shows that I'm serious about buying the product, but I still want a good deal."
