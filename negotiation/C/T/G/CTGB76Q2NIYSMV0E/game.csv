"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $950,000.  This is a significant step closer to my budget, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
