"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000, which is a good compromise, I think. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to come down another $250 and offer you the product for $8,750. This is my final offer, so I hope you can meet me in the middle.",8750.0,Alice,5,
