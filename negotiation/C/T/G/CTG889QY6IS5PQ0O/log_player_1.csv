Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum price, you have leverage.  The goal is to see if Bob is willing to pay more than $12,000, maximizing your profit. However, you need to be careful not to alienate Bob with an unreasonably high price.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $13,500.  I believe this reflects its worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Open:** The message is clear about your intention and the fact that this is a limited-time offer.
* **Value-Based Pricing:**  Instead of starting at $12,000, you're anchoring the price higher at $13,500, highlighting the ""unique value.""
* **Room for Negotiation:** The price leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he's interested but not willing to pay the full $13,500.
* **Alternative Implied:**  By mentioning listing it ""publicly,"" you subtly remind Bob that other buyers might be interested.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. Depending on your knowledge of Bob and your risk tolerance, you could adjust the initial offer. However, starting with a price above your minimum gives you the best chance to maximize your potential profit."
