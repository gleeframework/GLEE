"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product and I know you've expressed some interest.  I'm thinking somewhere in the range of $20,000 would be a fair price. What are your thoughts?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to consider $12,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is quite a bit below what I'm hoping to get for the product.  Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $14,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",14000.0,Bob,4,
