"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. Let's start with a price of $1,200,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This represents a significant gain for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $850,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're aiming for a higher price, but $1,050,000 is still outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a considerable increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product for me. I'm eager to reach an agreement, so let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, $950,000 is still $550,000 below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and my minimum price, which would be $1,225,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1225000.0,Alice,5,
