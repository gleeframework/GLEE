"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's true value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a reasonable price. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $1,175,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm confident that we can find a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
