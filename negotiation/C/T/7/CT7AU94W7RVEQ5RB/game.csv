"Alice, your offer is a great starting point, but it's a bit higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $975,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value and the time I've invested in it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",975000.0,Alice,5,
