"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product from me. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business.

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $1200000 is a bit steep for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to be flexible. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $900000.  This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let's find a way to make this deal work.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1050000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1050000 is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1000000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. It also reflects the value we've discussed. What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you're offering. I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1075000. This is a compromise that I believe still reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to be flexible. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
