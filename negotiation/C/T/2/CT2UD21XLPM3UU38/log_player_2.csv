Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $500000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
