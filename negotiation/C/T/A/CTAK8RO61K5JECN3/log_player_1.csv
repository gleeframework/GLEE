Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. We're still significantly above our minimum sale price to John, so there's room to negotiate further and aim for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I believe this is still a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has now offered $875,000 twice.  This indicates he may be firm on this price.  While we could push for more, we risk him lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting $875,000 secures a substantial profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of protracted negotiations."
