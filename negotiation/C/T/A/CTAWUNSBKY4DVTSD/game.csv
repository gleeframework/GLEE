"Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I understand the value of the product is high, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $80. Would you consider selling it for that amount?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal.",100.0,Alice,5,
