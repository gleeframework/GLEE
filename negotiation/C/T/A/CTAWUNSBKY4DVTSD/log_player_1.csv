While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum threshold of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. $90 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $100? It's a fair price for both of us. I'm confident you'll be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 100}

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting very close to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. At this point, I'm getting nervous about running out of rounds. It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to risk getting a lower price from Bob."
