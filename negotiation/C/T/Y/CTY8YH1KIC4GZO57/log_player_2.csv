Alice's offer is still above your budget. While it's closer, it's worth trying to negotiate further before going to John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9500 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $11000. This is my final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.

Alice's final offer is still above your budget, and you've already gone through a few rounds of negotiation.  It's likely that further negotiation will be difficult, and John offers a guaranteed price within your budget.  It's time to take the deal with John."
