"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,250? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is closer to my minimum. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
