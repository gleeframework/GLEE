Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate with Bob and potentially earn more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * You make a $150,000 profit above your minimum.
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to the product's value to him.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and consider the offer seriously. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:** You don't know how much Bob might be willing to negotiate. This offer leaves some room for him to counter-propose if he's particularly savvy.
* **Risk Tolerance:** There's a small risk that Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell to John at the guaranteed price. However, the potential for higher profit with Bob is worth exploring."
