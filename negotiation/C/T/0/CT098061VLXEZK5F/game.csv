"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference at $115?  This is my final offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $115, which would be $122.50. This is my final offer.",122.5,Alice,5,
