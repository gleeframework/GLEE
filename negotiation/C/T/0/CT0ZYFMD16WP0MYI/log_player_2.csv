"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  The product is only worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** You have 10 rounds to get a better price, and you know you can get it for $100 from John if needed. 
* **Counteroffering is the best strategy:**  You can start by making a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** By offering $90, you're making a significant counteroffer, showing Alice that you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** You're still leaving space for Alice to counter without you having to immediately switch to John.
* **Setting the stage for a possible compromise:**  $90 is closer to your target price of $100, and it might be an acceptable compromise for Alice if she wants to close the deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth more than $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:**  She's lowered the price from $120 to $105, which shows she's willing to negotiate. 
* **Still too high:**  You're targeting $100, and $105 is still more than that.
* **Counteroffering is still the best option:** You have 7 rounds left, and you can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $100 for the product. This is my final offer, as I can get it elsewhere for that price. Let me know if you're interested in making a deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This is your target price and you've made it clear that you're prepared to walk away if needed.
* **Firm but fair:** You've shown flexibility by increasing your offer, but you're not willing to budge further. 
* **Pressure on Alice:**  This puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal at your target price or risk losing the sale entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to get the best deal, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $100, as it's still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to considering other buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** You're aiming for $100, and Alice is at $110.
* **Limited time:** You're in round 5, with only 5 rounds remaining.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:** You know you can buy the product from John for $100.

**It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John than to risk continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially ending up with a worse price or no deal at all.**"
