"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm sure you'll love it! I'm offering it to you for $100.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  Using a positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more open to the deal. 
* **Open Ended Question:**  Ending with a question encourages Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would you consider lowering the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $80 is below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it does indicate his willingness to negotiate.  There's room for a middle ground. 
* **Rounds Remaining:**  With 9 rounds left, I can afford to reject this offer and explore more profitable options."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting halfway between my initial price ($100) and Bob's offer ($80).
* **Empathy:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal to show I'm listening.
* **Direct Approach:** I'm making a clear offer and leaving the decision in Bob's hands."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, would you be able to offer the product at $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Time to Push:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating and push for a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob yet. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and showing a willingness to negotiate.  There's a good chance he'll come up in price with another offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really wanting to work with you here.  $85 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle again at $92.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 92.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistent Negotiation:** I'm continuing to push for a higher price, but showing flexibility with my counteroffer.
* **Middle Ground Again:**  By suggesting $92.50, I'm again proposing a price halfway between my previous offer ($90) and Bob's latest offer ($85).
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as ""fair"" for both of us, to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget constraints, could you consider $87.5 as a fair price for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $87.50 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. 
* **Few Rounds Left:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the pressure is mounting, but I still have time to negotiate further.  
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing persistence and a willingness to come up in price.  I believe there's still potential for a more profitable deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I could sell to John for $120, I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more from Bob before resorting to that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really close to meeting you in the middle. Let's try $90 one more time. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal! "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm making a final push to see if I can get Bob to accept a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Repeating Previous Offer:**  I'm repeating my offer of $90, which was initially a compromise and may be more appealing to Bob now that he's seen lower offers.
* **Urgency and Closure:**  I'm adding a sense of urgency by saying ""let's finally close this deal"" to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **John's Offer as Backdrop:**  I'm keeping John's offer of $120 in mind, but still hoping to get a slightly better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. Considering my budget, could you please offer the product at $88.75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Two Rounds Remaining:** With only two rounds left, the time for negotiation is dwindling. 
* **Minimal Gain:** Bob's offer of $88.75 is only a slight improvement from his previous offer of $87.50. It's not worth risking a potential loss by rejecting it. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $120, which is a much better price than what I'm currently getting from Bob. 
* **No Guarantee of Agreement:**  There's no guarantee that Bob will accept my final counteroffer in the next round, and I'm risking losing the deal entirely.

By selling to John, I can secure a significantly better price with no risk of losing the sale."
