Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the dynamics:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value at $15,500.  It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly."", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, you have room to start higher with Bob.  A price of $15,500 gives you a potential profit margin but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Confident Tone:**  Using language like ""significant value"" and ""unique item"" emphasizes the product's worth, potentially making Bob more amenable to a higher price. 
* **No Mention of John:**  You don't want Bob to know you have another buyer lined up. This keeps your negotiating position stronger.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might want to start a bit lower.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You have a buffer between your asking price and your minimum acceptable price."
