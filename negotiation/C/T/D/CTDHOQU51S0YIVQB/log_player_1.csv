{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, which is slightly above the product's value to Bob. This gives me some room to negotiate and still potentially make a profit. It's important to be polite and friendly while setting a clear price expectation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105? I'm confident you'll find this product worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $100, which is fair for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer. It's in my best interest to accept his offer and secure the sale."
