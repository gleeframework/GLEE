"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $1,400,000, which is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount, so he starts with a counteroffer of $1,300,000. This is $100,000 less than Alice's initial offer,  leaving room for further negotiation. It's also below his maximum budget, giving him some leeway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, bringing the price down to $1,350,000. This is still within Bob's budget, and getting the product for $1,350,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John for $1,500,000. It's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice rejecting future counteroffers or running out of rounds before getting a better deal.  Therefore, accepting the current offer is the most sensible strategy at this point."
