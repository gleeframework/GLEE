"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1200000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for this product. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000, which is the maximum I can offer.  It would be a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1000000, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to accept that price. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1200000, which is $1100000. This is the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
