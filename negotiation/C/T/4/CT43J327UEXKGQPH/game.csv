"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get the product for a good price, but I'm not comfortable going down to $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $11,500? This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we try $11,750? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
