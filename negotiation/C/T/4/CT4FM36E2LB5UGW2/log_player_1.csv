Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Minimum:** The offer is significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($10,000), ensuring a good profit.

**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, but the potential gain from his higher perceived value makes it a risk worth taking."
