"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950000 is a bit too steep for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to offer $750000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875000 is still a bit too high. How about $800000? This reflects the value you've placed on the product, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
