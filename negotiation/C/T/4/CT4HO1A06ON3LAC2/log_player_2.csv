"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1500000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a good price, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is better than her initial price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can likely get a better deal if you continue to negotiate. Rejecting this offer allows you to make another counteroffer and potentially close the gap further."
