"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the value I know it holds for you, while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can work together to close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to go up to $980,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can agree on a price that works for both of us.",980000.0,Bob,6,
