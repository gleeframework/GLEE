{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm asking for $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm indicating willingness to negotiate, which might encourage Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Positive language:**  I'm trying to create a positive tone to increase the chance of Bob being interested. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll need to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I think the product sounds interesting, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get more.  
* **Room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to my initial asking price. 
* **Assessing Bob's willingness:** By seeing how much Bob is willing to budge, I can get a better sense of his value for the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between $120 and $150.  I'll need to consider how much I'm willing to compromise based on my assessment of Bob's interest and the value of the product to me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135.  That's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows I'm willing to compromise and helps keep negotiations moving forward.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reiterating the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm keeping the conversation friendly and open to negotiation. 

**Important Note:** This is just a counteroffer. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response and the value of the product to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I think that's a more reasonable price for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120.  
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $135,  I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. 
* **Time consideration:** Each round of negotiation takes time, and I don't want to waste too much time haggling.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $125. While it's not my ideal price, it's a reasonable compromise and ensures a sale."
