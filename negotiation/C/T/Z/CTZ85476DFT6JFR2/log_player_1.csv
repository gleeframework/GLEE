Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

This is a starting offer that is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price, leaving room for negotiation. This strategy aims to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest:**  A high initial price will signal to Bob the value you place on the product. 
2. **Establish a starting point:** This sets a baseline for further negotiation. 
3. **Avoid selling too low:**  This prevents you from accidentally accepting a low price early on.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can adjust your strategy based on his counteroffer and how much you believe the product is worth to him."
