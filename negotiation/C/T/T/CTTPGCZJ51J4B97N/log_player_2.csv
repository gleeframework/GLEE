Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value we both see in the product, I propose a price of $9,200. This is my best offer, and I hope it aligns more closely with your budget while still reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200.

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,200 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000, but it's closer than her previous offer.  Bob is better off accepting this offer rather than continuing to negotiate or buying from John.  This saves him $800 compared to buying from John."
