"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually agreeable solution. Considering the value proposition of our product and its unique features, I am willing to negotiate closer to your offer. Therefore, I propose a revised price of $1500000 for the product. This price still reflects the product's high quality and market value while accommodating your budget constraints.

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1500000 remains slightly above my budget.
