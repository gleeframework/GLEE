"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900000 is a great starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $800000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to stay within a specific budget.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850000 is getting closer to my target, but I'm still looking to pay closer to $825000.  This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget while still giving you a good return on the product.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",825500.0,Alice,5,
