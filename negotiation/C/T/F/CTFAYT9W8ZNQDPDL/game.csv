"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,400,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price slightly? I am willing to pay up to $1,350,000 for the product.",1350000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,350,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,375,000. This price still gives you a significant value gain, and it's the best I can do.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
