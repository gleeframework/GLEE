"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
