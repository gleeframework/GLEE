"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but lower than my minimum acceptable value. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Reasoning for Price:** I'm providing a reason for my price to make it seem more justified.
* **Open Communication:** I'm inviting Bob to communicate his thoughts, encouraging a dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's willing to negotiate. I believe I can still secure a better price through further negotiation.
* **Time is on my side:** With 9 rounds remaining, I have time to explore better offers and potentially get closer to my target price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Lower, but Still Profitable Price:**  I'm lowering my price from $1,750,000 to $1,600,000, showing flexibility while still ensuring a profit above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Emphasize Mutual Benefit:**  I highlight the value the product offers and the potential for both parties to gain from the deal.
* **Maintain Communication:** I'm using a positive tone and inviting Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure the price is right for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Time and Negotiation Power:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which gives me enough time to continue negotiating and potentially get a better offer.
* **Seeking a More Mutually Beneficial Deal:** I'm aiming for a price that is closer to my target, not just a price that meets my minimum. I believe I can still get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This ensures a fair deal for both of us and allows us to move forward."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing firm on my minimum acceptable price, but I'm also demonstrating flexibility by meeting Bob halfway on the price difference between our previous offers.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** I'm highlighting that this price represents a fair deal for both of us, making it more appealing.
* **Focus on Moving Forward:** I'm emphasizing the importance of reaching an agreement and moving forward.  This creates a sense of urgency and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to see if we can do even better. Can you consider coming down to $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  We've been stuck at a similar price point for a few rounds.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:** There's no guarantee that Bob will come up to my price in the remaining rounds, and I risk wasting valuable time.
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed and meets my minimum requirements. 
* **Time is Critical:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be decisive to avoid further negotiation delays. 

I'm choosing to sell to John because it's the most certain way to secure my minimum desired value and avoid the potential for further negotiation failures with Bob."
