"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to start the negotiation with a competitive price. I'm offering the product to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $12,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $11,000.  Let's try to find a price that works for both of us. ",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still a bit far from breaking even at $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a minimum of $13,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we try $12,750?",12750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $12,750 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,500.  This is a fair compromise and allows both of us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable with $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about we try $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",12000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $13,000. I'm willing to make one final concession, but I need to meet my minimum price. How about we try $12,250? It's a compromise, but it's the lowest I can go.",12250.0,Alice,9,
