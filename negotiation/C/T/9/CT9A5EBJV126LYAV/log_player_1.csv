Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a great opportunity to own it."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $12,000 as possible. Offering a price slightly below John's offer might entice Bob.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if Alice earns slightly less than from John, as it avoids potential delays. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  Starting high leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially reaching a price that's still very profitable for Alice. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation.  In a real-world scenario, Alice might adjust her price based on Bob's response or make counter-offers."
