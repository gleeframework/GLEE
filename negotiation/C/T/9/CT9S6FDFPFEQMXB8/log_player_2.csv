"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth is significantly higher than that. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. If I accept, I'll be paying $1,100,000, which is more than my budget of $800,000. I'll reject the offer and see if I can find a better deal elsewhere.
