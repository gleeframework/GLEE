"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your business. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset at a competitive price.  Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
