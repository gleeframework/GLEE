{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in Round 7 with only 3 rounds remaining. Alice's offer of $11,500 is close to your desired price point. If you reject this offer and continue negotiating, there is a high chance you won't be able to reach an agreement, and you will end up buying the product from John for $15,000.  

Accepting this offer allows you to get the product for a reasonable price and avoids the risk of ending up with a worse deal."
