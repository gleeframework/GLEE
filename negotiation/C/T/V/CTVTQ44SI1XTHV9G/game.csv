"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll find that reflected in this adjusted price.",12000.0,Alice,3,
