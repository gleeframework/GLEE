"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation, but still ensures I make a profit over my minimum value of $150.  Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$60 is way too low. I'm definitely not selling for that price.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer, but still below my initial asking price. Hopefully, this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I won't be giving the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offers are getting increasingly unreasonable. I'm not going to sell for $70. I'll keep trying to negotiate with him, but I'm getting closer to the point where I'll just sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to lower my price again to $160. This is a compromise, but I'm still confident I can get a good price for the product. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not serious about negotiating.  I've lowered my price multiple times, but he's only willing to offer a fraction of what the product is worth. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  At least I'll get my minimum price."
