"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  I'm also aware that I can sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While $15,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get more.  I'm going to see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's initial counteroffer. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if he's willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,500 is higher than what I could get from John, and it's only $500 less than my initial asking price.  I'm going to accept his offer to avoid potentially losing more rounds and ultimately getting a lower price."
