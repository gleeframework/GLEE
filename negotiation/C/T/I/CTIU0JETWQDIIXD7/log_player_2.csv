"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to own this amazing product. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the value the product brings, I can offer you the product for $15,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. It makes more sense to buy from John for $15,000 and avoid further negotiation."
