"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it. This reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while addressing your budget considerations.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
