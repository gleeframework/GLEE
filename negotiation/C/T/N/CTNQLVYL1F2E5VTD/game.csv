"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential, I find the price point a little high. Would you be willing to consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Let's try $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price for the value this product brings.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, my budget caps out at $900,000 for this. If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I can see you're serious about this, and I appreciate your transparency. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let's try $950,000. It's a bit above your budget, but I think it's a sweet spot for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
