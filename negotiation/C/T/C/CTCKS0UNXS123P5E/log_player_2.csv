"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:** You value the product at $12,000, and Alice is offering it for $10,000. This means you'll save $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* **It's still a good deal:** You're getting the product for less than your maximum price, making it a successful negotiation."
