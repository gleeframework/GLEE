"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm afraid $13500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. My final counteroffer is $12500. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider purchasing from John for $10000.",12500.0,Bob,10,
