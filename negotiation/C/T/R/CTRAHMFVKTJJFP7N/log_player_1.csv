{""message"": ""Bob, I'm confident this product is worth a lot to you, and I'm open to negotiating a fair price.  I'm starting at $1,400,000, reflecting its value and my initial expectations.  Let's see if we can find a number that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's value, but given my understanding of market conditions and similar transactions, I believe a more reasonable starting point would be around $1,000,000. Let's aim for a price that respects the product's worth while also being fair to both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than the product's worth to me. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have a backup buyer in John. I'll counteroffer Bob and try to find a middle ground."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $1,000,000 undervalues this product significantly.  Given its unique qualities and potential, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects a compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.  I'm open to continuing negotiations, but I believe this price is fair and reasonable."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I acknowledge the value you place on the product, but based on market analysis and comparable transactions, I think a fair price would be closer to $1,150,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that respects both the product's worth and our financial considerations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not comfortable with Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold.  I'll counteroffer again and aim for a price closer to $1,200,000. If I can't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,150,000 is still below the minimum I can accept for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,175,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering the product's characteristics and recent market trends, I propose a price of $1,160,000. This amount reflects a fair compromise between our positions and allows for a transaction that benefits both parties. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to settle. I believe I can get closer to my desired price, and I don't want to sell for significantly less than the product's worth. I'll counteroffer one more time and see if I can secure a better deal. If not, I'm prepared to sell to John."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. After careful consideration, I would like to suggest a final price of $1,162,500. This amount aims to strike a balance between respecting the product's value and ensuring a fair transaction for both of us.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $1,200,000, it's getting late in the negotiation. I'm worried that if I reject this offer, I might not get another one that's even close, and I could end up selling to John for less than I want. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and take the $1,162,500."
