"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its true value. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,200 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for the product. Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you $9,000. This gives you a great deal, and allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I can do $8,800, and that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my means.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to at least get $9,200 for this product.  It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,200. I can do $8,500, and that's my final offer. I really like the product, but I need to be responsible with my budget.",8500.0,Bob,6,
