"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price of $8,000. There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and you have the option of buying from John for $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is closer to your target, but still slightly above it.  You have a strong backup option in John, who's willing to sell for $8,000.  Rejecting this offer gives you another opportunity to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  With 7 rounds remaining, there's still time to potentially find a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $8,750 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. I'm confident we can reach an agreement on this price."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,900. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is getting close to your target, but you can still potentially get a better deal.  You have a solid fallback option with John, who will sell for $8,000. With 5 rounds left, you have time to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going and might push her to come down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $8,900 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground on this offer."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,950. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,950 is still slightly above your target price. While you could continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal, you only have 3 rounds left, and there's a risk that the negotiation could stall.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $8,000. This guarantees you the product at your target price and avoids any further potential delays or uncertainties in the negotiation with Alice."
