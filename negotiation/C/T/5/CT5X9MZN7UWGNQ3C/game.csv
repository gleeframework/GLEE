"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. I think this is a great starting point, considering the product's value to you is $8,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $9,500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it, which reflects its value to me and allows for a fair profit margin for you. I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me is $12,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,750.

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $8,900 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground on this offer.",8800.0,Bob,6,
