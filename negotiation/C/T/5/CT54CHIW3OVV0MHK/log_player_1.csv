Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  I'm happy to get straight to it and offer you a special price for it at $20,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you meet me at that price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  To make this work, I can come down to $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down to $17,000. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm still a bit shy of that price. Can you meet me at $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.
