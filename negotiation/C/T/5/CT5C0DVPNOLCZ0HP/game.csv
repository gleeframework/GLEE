"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $650,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This reflects the significant value of the product and gives you a fair price. Let's make a deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and it shows my commitment to reaching an agreement. I believe this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this opportunity.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting close!  I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I want to make this work.  How about we settle at $780,000? That's a fair compromise.",780000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your commitment to finding a solution.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to drop to $820,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy.  It's also a strong indicator of my commitment to this deal.",820000.0,Alice,7,
