"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,400,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm not sure I can go as high as $1,400,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,325,000?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,325,000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,200,000 is still below my initial ask, I'm ready to make a significant move. Let's settle this at $1,275,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
