"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay a bit more than what John is offering, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",130.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more than $130. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great deal for you. How about we split the difference?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a bit more, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $135. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",135.0,Bob,4,
