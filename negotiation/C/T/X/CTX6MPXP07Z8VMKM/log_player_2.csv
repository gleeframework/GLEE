# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that I think is very reasonable, considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
