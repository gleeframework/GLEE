"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product for $11,500. This is a special opportunity for you to acquire an item worth $12,000 at a slightly discounted rate. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is good, it's still above your desired price point.  You want to save as much as possible, so it makes sense to try and negotiate further.  Rejecting her offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to go down to $10,500?  That would be a great price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I must maintain the value of our product. Therefore, I cannot accept $10,500. My counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still within my budget and a good deal, as I am looking to pay no more than $12,000. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject my counteroffer and I might end up paying the full $12,000 to John. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids any potential delays or complications."
