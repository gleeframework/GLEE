"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you considering my budget.  $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $14,500?",14500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  Let's split the difference again. How about $13,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",13750.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but I need to make a small adjustment to cover my costs. How about we say $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have costs to cover, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,875? That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",13875.0,Bob,6,
