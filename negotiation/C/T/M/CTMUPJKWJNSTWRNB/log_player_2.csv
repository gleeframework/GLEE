"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for less than $14,000 from Alice, or he can buy from John for $15,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss a price of $14,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can still potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, or he can buy from John for $15,000.  $14,500 is still too high for Bob."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $13,750, but I need to make a small adjustment to cover my costs. How about we say $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. Even though it's the same as her initial offer, he's shown that he's willing to go up to $13,750.  This is a good opportunity to try to negotiate again and see if Alice will come down slightly.  If not, he can always buy from John."
