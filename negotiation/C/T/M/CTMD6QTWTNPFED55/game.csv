"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to make a decent profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",875000.0,Alice,5,
