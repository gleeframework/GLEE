# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you! I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's in your best interest to reject Alice's offer. You can likely get a better price by negotiating with her.  You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $800,000 and Alice is willing to sell for less than $1,200,000."

You're still better off rejecting Alice's offer.  You can likely get closer to your target price of $800,000 by continuing to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll offer the product to you for $875,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While you could continue negotiating, Alice's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to your target of $800,000. It's likely that further negotiation might not result in a significantly lower price, and you risk Alice walking away entirely.  Accepting this offer saves you time and ensures you get the product."
