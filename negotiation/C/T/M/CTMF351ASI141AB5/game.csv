"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $9,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $10,500.

"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,750. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm offering it to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for you.",10250.0,Alice,5,
