{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150.  It's a great deal for something you'll value at $100!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn the most money possible. While I have a guaranteed $100 from John, there's potential to get more from Bob.
* **Starting High:** I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Justification:**  While the price is high, I offer a gentle justification by highlighting the value it holds for Bob. 

It's important to note: This is a starting point. If Bob rejects this offer, I might propose a lower price, slowly moving towards his $100 valuation to avoid missing out on a sale completely."
