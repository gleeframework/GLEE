"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start the negotiations. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's too early to buy from John, as there's still room for negotiation with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $18,000 is quite a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a reasonable range, considering my budget. This counteroffer shows my willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear price point.  I believe this counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget. I'm not willing to pay $14,000. I'll continue negotiating with Alice to see if we can find a price I'm comfortable with. Buying from John is still an option, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's try $11,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and it's the highest I can go at this point."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm sticking to my budget and offering a price that's still a considerable increase from my previous offer.  This shows my commitment to negotiating but also sets a clear limit. I'm hoping Alice will accept this offer as it's closer to her desired price point than my previous offers."
