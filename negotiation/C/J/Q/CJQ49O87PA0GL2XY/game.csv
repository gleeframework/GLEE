"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, considering the value of the product. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit. Let's see if we can make this work.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,000,000. This seems to be closer to the midpoint of our previous offers, and I believe it would be beneficial for both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
