{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $15,000 to you and I'm willing to go lower than my minimum price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this meets within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $13,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can get Bob to come up a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,000 is still a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I'll take $13,500?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
