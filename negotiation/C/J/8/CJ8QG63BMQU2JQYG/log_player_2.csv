"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I believe you'll find it's a great deal, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000 less from John.  While Alice's offer is a good deal, Bob can do better by negotiating with Alice or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's still a good price for you, considering your value of $8,000, and it allows me to save some money. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,250 is a good deal for Bob. He can save $750 compared to buying from John. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject his next counteroffer, and he'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  It's wiser to accept the offer and secure a good deal."
