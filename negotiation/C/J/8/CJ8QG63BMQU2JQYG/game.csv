"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's still a good price for you, considering your value of $8,000, and it allows me to save some money. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,250. This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,3,
