"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a very attractive price.  My initial offer is $1,250,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product holds for you, I believe we can find a middle ground. How about we split the difference and go with $1,175,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with the deal.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above $1,175,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
