"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to get a lower price. He has a clear upper limit of $1,000,000, so he has the leverage to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to bridge the gap between Alice's price and his budget. He's trying to find a price that's still attractive to Alice, as it's above her minimum value for the product. This counteroffer signals that Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to pay a fair price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I was really hoping to get closer to the $1,000,000 mark. I'm willing to compromise, though. I can offer it to you for $920,000. This is my best price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's preferred price point. However, it is closer to Bob's budget than her initial offer. Bob still has room for negotiation and can try to lower the price further. It's better to risk another round of negotiation and try to get a better price than to settle for $920,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $885,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 885000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's last offer. He's aiming to find a middle ground and show that he's serious about finalizing the deal.  This price also still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's getting close to his preferred price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to $900,000. I can offer it to you for $897,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $897,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $897,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $897,500 is within Bob's budget and is very close to his desired price point. It's more advantageous for Bob to accept this offer than to risk a counteroffer, which could lead to a stalemate or Alice withdrawing the offer altogether. This offer also saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John for $1,000,000."
