"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $885,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to come to an agreement. Let's make this happen!",885000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to $900,000. I can offer it to you for $897,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",897500.0,Alice,5,
