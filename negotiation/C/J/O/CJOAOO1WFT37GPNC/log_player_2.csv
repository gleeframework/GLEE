"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $170 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $120. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

Bob's counteroffer is $100. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start with a lower price to show Alice that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $140 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

Bob is getting closer to his target price.  He is willing to pay a little more than his absolute limit, but still wants to save some money.  A counter-offer of $110 shows commitment to buying the product, but also shows Alice that Bob is still willing to walk away if the price isn't right."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob has reached his limit. Alice's offer of $125 is only $5 less than John's price, and there is only a limited number of rounds left. It's not worth risking losing the opportunity to buy from John for a potential $5 saving."
