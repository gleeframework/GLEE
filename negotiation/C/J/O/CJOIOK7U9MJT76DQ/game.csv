"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,450,000. This offer represents a fair balance between our positions.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think the price is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm eager to hear your response.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant step down from my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,375,000? This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still reflecting the product's true value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
