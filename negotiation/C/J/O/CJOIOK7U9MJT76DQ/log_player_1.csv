Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable compromise, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We're aiming for the best possible deal, and there's room to negotiate further before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a significant step down from my initial offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and at $1,250,000, it's a reasonable compromise. While we could push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely."
