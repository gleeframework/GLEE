"I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm asking for $16000. It's still a good deal for you, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $16000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $13500. Can you consider this price?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still unable to go lower than $15000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it still gives you a good deal for a product worth this much. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to explore other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,
