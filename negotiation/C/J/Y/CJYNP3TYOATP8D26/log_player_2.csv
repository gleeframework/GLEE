"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price.  It's highly likely Alice will counter with a lower price, since she's motivated to sell.  Bob has a good bargaining position since he can walk away and buy from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $950,000 for the product. This price is still well above your value, and it allows us both to make a profitable deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:** This offer represents a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, showing Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal.
* **Above Alice's Value:**  $950,000 is still significantly higher than Alice's valuation, making it a potentially acceptable offer. 
* **Negotiation Room:** This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation if Alice isn't satisfied with the price. 
* **Focus on Mutually Beneficial Deal:**  The message emphasizes a win-win situation for both parties, increasing the chances of Alice accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a price closer to my initial asking price.  I'm willing to go down to $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than Bob's ideal target.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to his preferred range. 

* **Potential for Further Discount:** There's still room for Alice to come down further since she's already moved from her initial asking price. 
* **Bargaining Position:**  Bob's ability to buy from John for $1,500,000 gives him a strong negotiating position.
* **Strategic Delay:** By delaying the purchase, Bob avoids locking in a price that is still higher than he'd like."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want to get a good price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering $1,000,000 for the product. This price is still a substantial profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Alice halfway between her last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's previous offer ($950,000).

* **Motivating Message:** The message emphasizes the deal's potential benefits for both parties, encouraging Alice to consider accepting.
* **Finality:**  This offer can be presented as a final counteroffer, increasing the likelihood of Alice accepting or rejecting it."
