"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $1,100,000 for this product.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,075,000? This is a fair price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
