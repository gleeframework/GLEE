Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, but she also wants to avoid the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer that gives Bob a significant discount compared to what John is willing to pay. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a public listing, Alice subtly creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly."
