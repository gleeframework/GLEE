"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This gives you a significant saving compared to its true value, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",14000.0,Alice,1,
