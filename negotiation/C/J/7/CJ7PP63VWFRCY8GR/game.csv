,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8000. Would you be willing to consider that offer?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $18000. This is the best I can do, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still above my budget.  Let's try to meet halfway. How about $12000? I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget and the value of the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I can offer you the product for $16000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for what you'll be getting.",16000.0,Alice,5,
