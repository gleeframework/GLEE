"I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. It's a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $8,000?  I think that's a fair price that would allow me to buy it from you today.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit, too. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,500? It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $9,250?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to meet you at $9,500. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",9500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to be reasonable here. I can go up to $9,300, but that's my absolute limit. If that works for you, we have a deal!",9300.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,300. I'm willing to meet you at $9,800, but that's my final offer. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find reasonable, considering the product's value.",9800.0,Alice,7,
