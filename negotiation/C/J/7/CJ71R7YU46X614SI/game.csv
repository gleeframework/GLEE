"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a good price for both of us, and I'm confident the product will be worth more than that to you. Let's make this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we try $10,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in negotiating, and $10,000 is closer to what I'm looking for.  However, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $11,000?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth more than that in the long run. Let's see if we can close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
