"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it leaves room for us to negotiate further if needed. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($1,000,000 vs. $800,000), indicating there's room for negotiation.
* It's still significantly higher than your maximum budget ($1,000,000 vs. $1,200,000).
* You have 10 rounds, so rejecting and counter-offering allows for better negotiation and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:** This counteroffer demonstrates a serious intent to negotiate while still leaving room for further bargaining.
* **Fair Price:**  $900,000 is still above Alice's worth of $800,000, suggesting a potential win-win scenario.
* **Room for Compromise:** This leaves room for further negotiation in subsequent rounds if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $950,000 is a reasonable compromise,  meeting you halfway from your previous counteroffer of $900,000.
* **Significant Savings:**  This price is significantly lower than your initial budget and a good deal considering your maximum budget of $1,200,000.
* **Time Consideration:** Accepting the offer saves valuable negotiation time and ensures you secure the product.

**Note:**  While further negotiation might be possible, accepting this offer minimizes risk and saves you money.  There's no guarantee of a better price in future rounds, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
