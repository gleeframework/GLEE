"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be of great value to your business. My asking price is $1,000,000.  It's a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and it leaves room for us to negotiate further if needed.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you and leaves room for both of us to make a deal.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not able to go that low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $950,000. This gives us both a good deal and keeps the negotiation moving forward.",950000.0,Alice,3,
