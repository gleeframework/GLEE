"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what I could get from another buyer. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is less than her product's worth, you have a better alternative. You know John will sell you the same product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can save $200,000."
