,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your interest, $900,000 is significantly below the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go lower than $950,000. It's a fair compromise considering the unique benefits this product offers. Let's make this deal happen.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from the product.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $925,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $937,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us to finalize this deal. What do you say?",937500.0,Alice,5,
