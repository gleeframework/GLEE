"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone like you, I'm proposing a starting price of $925,000. I'm confident this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see.",925000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of it. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $925,000. I would like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $750,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept. This product has the potential to bring you substantial returns, which I'm sure you understand. I'm willing to come down slightly to $880,000. This offer represents a fair compromise and reflects the product's worth.",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay up to $850,000 for the product. I hope this offers a reasonable compromise and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",850000.0,Bob,4,
