```

Bob has tried hard to negotiate a better price with Alice, but it seems she's not willing to go any lower. He's already used up 8 rounds of negotiation, and he only has two rounds left.  At this point, he's better off buying from John for $1,200,000 to avoid the risk of losing the product altogether. Even though it's not his ideal price, it's still within his budget, and he has guaranteed access to the product."
