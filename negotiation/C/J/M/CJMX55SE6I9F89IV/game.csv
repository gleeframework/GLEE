"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the enthusiasm for the product. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $900,000. I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad you're enthusiastic about it! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is a significant concession from my initial offer. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can reach an agreement closer to $950,000.  Let's keep working towards a deal that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $1,025,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $1,025,000 is still a bit out of reach. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us. ",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"Alice,  I'm close to my limit, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. That's a fair price for both of us, I believe.  Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're so close to a deal. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and my previous offer of $1,075,000, which is $1,062,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can wrap up the deal here.",1062500.0,Alice,9,
