"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'll sell it to you for $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John.  Rejecting this offer will likely lead Alice to propose a lower price, and even if she doesn't, you're securing a better deal by going with John."
