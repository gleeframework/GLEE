"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value you see in it, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price. Would it be possible to negotiate a price closer to $1,500,000? This would allow me to consider your offer more seriously.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us, $1,500,000 is significantly below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle a bit â€“ how about $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. However, I still feel that we might be able to reach an agreement closer to my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate down to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer. To be fair to my own bottom line, I could come down to $1,900,000. This offer represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and reflects my willingness to reach a deal.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet my budgetary needs. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose a final offer of $1,750,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations while staying within my financial limits.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
