"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you place on the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested, but my maximum budget for this purchase is $10000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm feeling more comfortable with $12000.  This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a fair price.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $12000 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in!",13500.0,Alice,5,
