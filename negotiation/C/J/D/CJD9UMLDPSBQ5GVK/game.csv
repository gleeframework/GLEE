"Alice, $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $85. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $125? I'm willing to sell the product to you for that price.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $100.  This is my final offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",115.0,Alice,5,
