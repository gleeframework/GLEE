"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $120.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, but $120 is still a bit steep for my budget. Could we do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, but $75 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to compromise at $140, but that's as low as I can go.",140.0,Alice,5,
