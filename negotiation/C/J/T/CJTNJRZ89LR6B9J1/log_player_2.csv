(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You want to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still too high.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You're still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $108 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still within your target range. There's room for more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and go with $106.50?  That feels fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 106.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $109. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

You've managed to negotiate a lower price from Alice, and $109 is within your budget. While you might be able to squeeze out an extra dollar or two with further negotiation, the risk of losing the deal entirely with Alice and having to buy from John for $120 outweighs the potential reward."
