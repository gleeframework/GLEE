I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm not sure if I want to sell to John yet, as I can still potentially get a better price from Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That would be a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  $90 is still a little low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference at $95?  That would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}

Round 6

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I'd like to get closer to $90, Bob's offer of $85 is only $5 away from my minimum.  I'm going to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and ensure a sale."
