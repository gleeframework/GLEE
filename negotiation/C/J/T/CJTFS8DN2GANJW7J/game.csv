"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
