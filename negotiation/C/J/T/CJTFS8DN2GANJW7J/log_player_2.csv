"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John.  $12,000 is a significant markup from her perceived value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider something closer to $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but within reason:** Starting with a significantly lower counter-offer ($6,000) leaves room for negotiation.  While it's a big difference from Alice's offer, it's still considerably less than her stated value of $15,000.
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** This counter-offer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price. 
* **John as a backup:** We always have the option to walk away and buy from John for $8,000 if negotiations with Alice don't progress favorably."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Progress, but not there yet:** Alice moving to $9,000 shows she's willing to negotiate. However, it's still $1,000 more than we can get it from John.
* **Maintain pressure:** Rejecting this offer keeps the pressure on Alice to move closer to a price we find acceptable. 
* **Next counter-offer strategy:**  We'll propose a price closer to our target, likely around $7,000, to signal our willingness to compromise while staying below John's price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Our offer of $7,000 splits the difference between Alice's current offer ($9,000) and our previous counter-offer ($6,000).
* **Staying below John:** This keeps us competitive and ensures we don't end up paying more than John's price. 
* **Direct and firm:** The message is clear and direct about our desired price, but still polite and respectful."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm still not comfortable with $7,000, but I'm willing to make one more move. I'll offer you $8,500. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached our limit:** Alice's final offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's price of $8,000. 
* **No more room to negotiate:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, so further counter-offers are unlikely to succeed.
* **John is the better option:**  At this point, it makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the $500."
