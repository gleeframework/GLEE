Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It's also below Bob's perceived value of $150, making it a potentially attractive deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $130 is still above my minimum price of $120 and is a reasonable compromise.  While I would prefer more, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly higher price, and I risk losing the sale altogether."
