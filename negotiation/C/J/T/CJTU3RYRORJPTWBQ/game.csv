"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This price is fair, considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,250,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $1,350,000? This price still allows me to get a reasonable return while giving you a better deal than my initial offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and close the deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
