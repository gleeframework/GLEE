"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob has a clear goal of saving as much money as possible.  Since Alice values the product at $1,200,000, there's likely room for negotiation. 
* **John's offer as leverage:** Knowing John is willing to sell for $1,500,000 gives Bob a strong bargaining position. This information can be used to push Alice closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial price of $1,200,000. This is a bold move, but it's justified:

* **Aggressive but reasonable:**  While it's a big drop, $1,000,000 is still a significant amount of money, making it a potentially acceptable compromise for Alice.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to walk away, reminding Alice that she has competition. 
* **Room for negotiation:** If Alice rejects this offer, Bob still has room to adjust his counteroffer upwards while remaining within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Good deal:** $1,300,000 is a good price for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's offer of $1,500,000 and within his budget.
* **Limited negotiation:** Bob has already made a significant counteroffer, and Alice has countered.  Further negotiation might not yield a better price and could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Risk of higher cost:**  There's no guarantee that Bob can get a lower price from Alice, and he runs the risk of having to pay John's higher price.  

By accepting Alice's offer, Bob secures a good price while minimizing the risk of a worse outcome."
