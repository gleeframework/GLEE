# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $15,000 to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
