"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested, I'm not quite ready to commit to $800,000. I'm looking to pay closer to $700,000 for this product. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This price is fair to both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $800,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
