"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer is $14,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and potentially get a better price. 
* While buying from John for $15,000 is an option, it's not ideal as Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob wants to save as much money as possible.
* Bob knows that Alice's minimum is $12,000, so he is offering $13,000 which is a fair compromise. 
* This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $13,500 is within Bob's budget of $15,000.
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject further offers and he'll end up paying $15,000 to John. 
* Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John."
