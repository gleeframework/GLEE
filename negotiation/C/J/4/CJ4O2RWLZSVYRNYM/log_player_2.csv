You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can likely get a better price than $14,000 since the product is only worth $10,000 to Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

You're still better off than buying from John, but Alice is clearly willing to negotiate further. A counteroffer might get you a better price."
