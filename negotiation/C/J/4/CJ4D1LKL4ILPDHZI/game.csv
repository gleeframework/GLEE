"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to $850,000.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about we split the difference between my last offer and yours and settle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $775,000 is still a little too low for me.  To show my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to drop my price to $825,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to come away satisfied. What do you say?",825000.0,Alice,5,
