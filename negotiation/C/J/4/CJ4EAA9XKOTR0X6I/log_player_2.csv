"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the substantial benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it."", ""product_price"": 600000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My initial offer is significantly lower than Alice's asking price and my maximum budget. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Alice's flexibility.
* **Anchoring:** By starting low, I'm trying to anchor the negotiation closer to my desired price range. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** I'm fully prepared to increase my offer if Alice rejects it, but I want to see how low she's willing to go."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer.  However,  $600,000 significantly undervalues the true potential of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair deal considering the immense value it holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product highly, and I do too. However, the price gap is still substantial for me.  Would you consider $700,000? That's a significant move on my part, demonstrating my serious interest."", ""product_price"": 700000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm increasing my offer, but not drastically.  I want to signal that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help me gauge if Alice is truly willing to move significantly from her initial price or if she's anchored closer to $1 million. 
* **Alternative in Mind:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option if Alice's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is closer to a fair price, I'm still seeking a figure that reflects the product's true worth. Let's meet in the middle â€“ I propose $950,000. This demonstrates my flexibility while ensuring a reasonable deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved a bit closer to my range, but $950,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer.  I need to signal that I'm getting close to my limit and John's offer is becoming a very real alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the continued negotiation. I appreciate you coming down, but  $950,000 is really pushing my budget.  To be completely transparent, I do have another offer at a significantly lower price.  If you could do $800,000, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll have to seriously consider the other offer."", ""product_price"": 800000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm presenting this as my best and final offer. This signals my seriousness and the real possibility of walking away.
* **Mentioning the Alternative:** Explicitly referencing the other offer adds pressure on Alice to make a competitive move.
* **Sticking to My Limit:**  I'm not exceeding my $800,000 limit. If Alice rejects this, I'm comfortable walking away and taking John's offer."
