"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value while accommodating your financial constraints. Let's make this deal work!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $10,500? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10,500 is a great step closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This price allows me to make this deal worthwhile, and I know you'll be thrilled with the product.  What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,

"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. Can you consider $10,500 again? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",10500.0,Bob,6,
