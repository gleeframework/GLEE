{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price above Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.  The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value while highlighting the good deal.  

I'm prepared to adjust my price based on Bob's response and the potential of a counteroffer, always keeping in mind my minimum price of $15,000 with John as an alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's far below my minimum price of $15,000. Accepting it would mean significant loss. I'll counteroffer to maintain a better negotiation position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I appreciate your interest.  However, $9,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This price reflects the product's value while accommodating your financial constraints. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm countering with $11,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer but still above Bob's proposed price.  This approach allows for further negotiation while still protecting my minimum price.  The message remains positive and reiterates my willingness to compromise while emphasizing the product's value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can you consider $10,500? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm unwilling to sell for less than $15,000.  I'll make a counteroffer and try to push the price up further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $10,500 is a great step closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This price allows me to make this deal worthwhile, and I know you'll be thrilled with the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm countering with $10,750, which is a compromise between our current positions. This price is still above my minimum price of $15,000 but it shows my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping that Bob will accept this offer, as it's closer to what he's willing to pay. The message remains positive and highlights the product's value while making it clear that I'm aiming for a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, Alice, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer. Can you consider $10,500 again? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

Bob has made his final offer, and it's still below my minimum price of $15,000.  While I value Bob's continued interest, I can't afford to sell the product at a loss. It's time to move on and secure the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
