# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth $1,200,000 to you, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's always beneficial to negotiate.  Since Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget, you should try to get a better price by counter-offering."

You're still above your budget of $1,200,000, so keep negotiating.  There's still room to lower the price."

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  It's better than buying from John for $1,200,000,  and it's worth taking the deal to secure the product."
