Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While I recognize your perspective on the price, I believe the product's true value sits closer to my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects a reasonable compromise, and I'm confident it would be a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm getting close to considering the offer from John, who is willing to sell the product for $1,500,000. I'd like to reach an agreement with you before exploring other options. What are your thoughts? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000

While I could push for more, Bob is clearly signaling that his next offer might be at or below John's offer. Accepting the $1,750,000 ensures a significant profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
