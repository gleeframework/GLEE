"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $13,000 is quite a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  This is my final offer. ",14500.0,Bob,4,
