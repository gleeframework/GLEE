Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting. Here's why:

* **It's significantly more than your minimum acceptable price ($8,000),** making it attractive to you.
* **It's less than the product's full value to Bob ($15,000),** giving him a potential benefit from the purchase.

This strategy increases your chances of getting a good price without risking a rejection that would force you to settle for John's offer."
