,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $110? I'm very interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $110 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, but I think it's a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  How about $125? I'm really interested in your product and think this is a fair price that's in both of our interests.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see that you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $127.50, but I think that's as low as I can go. This is the best price I can offer you, and I think it's still a fair deal for both of us.",127.5,Alice,5,
