Since the product is worth $80 to you, you can do better than Alice's offer of $100. It makes sense to reject and counteroffer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for 95. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.

You are still better off buying from John for $80 than accepting Alice's offer of $95.  It makes sense to keep negotiating with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for 92. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for you.

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than what you are willing to pay from John. It's better to buy from John to get the best price."
