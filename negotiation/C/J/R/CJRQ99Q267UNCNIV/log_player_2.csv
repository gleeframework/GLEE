You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice is offering the product for $15,000, it makes sense to accept the offer. You're getting the product at your maximum price, so you're not losing any money."
