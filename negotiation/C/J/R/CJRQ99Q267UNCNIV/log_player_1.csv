Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $15,000. This is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, giving me a profit.
* This strategy is based on the idea of trying to maximize my potential gain. I have a guaranteed sale to John at $12,000, so I'm willing to take a risk by offering a higher price to Bob.
* If Bob accepts, I make a profit of $3,000. If he rejects, I still sell the product to John for my minimum acceptable price."
