"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you.  It's worth at least $12,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000.  This gives you a significant savings and is a great deal considering its worth to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While you could try to negotiate with Alice further, accepting her offer of $14,000 saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John.  It's the best decision to maximize your savings."
