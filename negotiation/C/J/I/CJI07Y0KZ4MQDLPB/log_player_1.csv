Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing within a range profitable for you.
* **Create Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to overthink or delay his decision. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could adjust the price and message based on your perception of Bob's negotiating style and your risk tolerance."
