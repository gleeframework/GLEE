Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. Please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always beneficial to explore if we can get a higher price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. Offering it at or slightly below this price is unlikely to be attractive as it leaves him no room for profit or perceived value.
* **Negotiation Room:**  By starting at $1,400,000, we leave room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can still settle on a price higher than our guaranteed sale. 
* **Urgency:**  Subtly implying that this is a time-sensitive offer might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the initial price.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's negotiating style and risk appetite, you might choose a different opening price."
