Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe it's a great deal for you considering its value to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** $12,000 is higher than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, giving him some incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $12,000 is below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for you to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher price.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** The message is straightforward and conveys your intention of finding a mutually beneficial price.

By starting with this offer, you create a starting point for negotiations that gives you leverage while still allowing for a potential deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me, and it would be a great deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for such a low price. I have a safety net with John's offer, so I can afford to be more patient."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to my initial offer. How about $11,000? This would still be a good price for you, considering the value you place on the product, and it's a fair price for me. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $10,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a great deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not quite where I want to be. I'm willing to give Bob one more chance, but I'm not going to drop my price much further. I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, so I'm in a strong negotiating position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500.  That's getting closer to what I need.  However, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to meet you at $11,250. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away feeling good about the deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go any higher than $10,500. I really like the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet on this price. Can you meet me at $10,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It seems like Bob is not willing to budge any further.  While $10,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  Given that I have a guaranteed sale with John for $15,000, I'm going to stop negotiating with Bob and sell the product to John.  It's not ideal to leave money on the table, but it's better to secure a good deal than risk getting stuck with a low price."
