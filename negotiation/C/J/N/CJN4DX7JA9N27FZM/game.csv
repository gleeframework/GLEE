"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm hoping to get the price down a bit closer to $10,000.  How about $10,500? I'm really interested in the product, and this would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $11,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's work together to make this happen.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, and I'm committed to finding a deal.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $10,750? This would be a significant saving for me, and I believe it's still a good price for you.  Let's make this happen!",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. $10,750 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,875?
