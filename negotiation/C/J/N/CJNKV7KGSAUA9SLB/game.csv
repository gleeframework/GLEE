"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. Let me know if that's more to your liking!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to compromise further, so I'm counteroffering at $10,500. This is my final offer for now, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $10,500 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  I'm willing to go up to $9,800.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still a bit above your offer of $9,800. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $10,300. Let's see if we can shake on it!",10300.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're getting really close now.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  I'm hoping we can close this deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,8,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to meet you at the price you mentioned, but I'm going to add a small premium for the effort we've put into negotiating. I'm counteroffering at $10,200. Let's see if we can finalize this deal!",10200.0,Alice,9,
