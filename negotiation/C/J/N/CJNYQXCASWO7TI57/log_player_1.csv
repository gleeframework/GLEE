Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000.  I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he haggles you down.
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you (Alice), the message hints at its high value. This aims to justify the high asking price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, allowing you to be firm in your pricing.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  There's a risk that Bob might find the initial offer too high and walk away without counter-offering. 
* **Relationship:** If you value a long-term business relationship with Bob, a slightly less aggressive starting price might be more appropriate.

This offer aims to maximize your profit while acknowledging the potential risks involved in negotiation."
