"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet in the middle?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see your point, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,250,000.  How about we meet at $1,350,000? This would allow me to make some profit while still giving you a good deal on this valuable product. I'm open to further discussion if this doesn't work for you.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,300,000, so how about $1,275,000? This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000.  This would give you a great deal on the product, and I would still be able to make a decent profit.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us before I consider other options.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
