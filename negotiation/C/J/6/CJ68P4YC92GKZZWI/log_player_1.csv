Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $19,000, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for us both."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring you don't settle for less than your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates willingness to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  Mentioning the potential benefit to Bob aims to justify the high price and create a sense of value.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob only values the product at $10,000. Your offer needs to either convince him of its higher value or leave enough room for negotiation to reach a price he finds acceptable.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher starting price increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. You'll need to gauge his personality and negotiation style to determine the optimal balance between maximizing profit and securing the sale."
