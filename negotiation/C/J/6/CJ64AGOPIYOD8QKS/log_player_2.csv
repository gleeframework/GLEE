# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product for a one-time offer of $9,500. It's a rare find and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer of $9,500 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding with your backup option, John."
