Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth.  Let me know your decision, as I have another interested party."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000. You need to offer a price that's attractive to him but also significantly above his valuation.
* **Negotiation Room:**  The offer of $1,400,000 gives Bob a substantial discount while still earning you a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning another interested party creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob (e.g., his negotiation style), you could adjust your offer."
