"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1800000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping to get closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now willing to sell it to you for $1700000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to me.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm still working within my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000.
