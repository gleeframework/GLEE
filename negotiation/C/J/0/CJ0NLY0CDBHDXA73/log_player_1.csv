Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 
 
Here's the reasoning:

* **Your minimum:** You need to make at least $150, as John guarantees that price.
* **Bob's value:** The product is only worth $120 to Bob.
* **Negotiation:** You need to find a price that Bob might accept while still being significantly above his perceived value.

Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price to John ($149) creates a sense of urgency and potential loss for Bob if he declines. He might be convinced to pay a premium over his perceived value, especially if you present the offer with confidence."
