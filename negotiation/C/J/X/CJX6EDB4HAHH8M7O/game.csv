"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product that I know will be a great asset to your business. I've priced it at $1,000,000, which I believe is a fair value given its worth to you. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However,  $850,000 doesn't quite cover the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will still be a profitable acquisition for you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $900,000.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and provides a fair margin for both of us. Let's close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
