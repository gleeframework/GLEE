Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit. While she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, she wants to see if Bob will pay more.

**The Risk:** If Alice asks for too much, Bob will reject the offer, and she'll have to accept John's price.

**The Solution:** Alice should propose a price slightly above John's offer. This way, she increases her chances of getting a higher price from Bob without risking the guaranteed sale.

**The Offer:**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,550,000. I believe this reflects its worth and offers a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **The Message:**  The message is polite, professional, and emphasizes the product's value.
* **The Price:**  $1,550,000 is a 3.33% increase over John's offer. This is a significant enough markup to be worthwhile if Bob accepts but not so high that it's likely to scare him off."
