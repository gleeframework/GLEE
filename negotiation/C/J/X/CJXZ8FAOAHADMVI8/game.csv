"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1400000 is a good starting point, I'm still looking for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1600000? This allows for some room for negotiation and ensures we both get a fair deal.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1450000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $1550000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move closer to your offer.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
