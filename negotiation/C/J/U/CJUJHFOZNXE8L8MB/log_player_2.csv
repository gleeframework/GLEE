"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. This is your baseline.
* Alice's offer of $900,000 is better than John's, but there's still room for negotiation.
* Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a lower price through a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* My goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* I know the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, so I'm offering a price that's a bit higher than that, but still significantly lower than her initial offer of $900,000.
* This counteroffer allows for potential negotiation and could lead to a price that is more favorable for me."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is higher than her initial offer of $900,000. This indicates she's not willing to budge much on her price.
* My goal is to save as much money as possible, and at this point, I'm better off buying from John for $1,000,000 than accepting Alice's offer.  
*  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will lead to a better price, and I risk wasting time and potentially losing the opportunity to buy from John."
