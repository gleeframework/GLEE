You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

It's not worth buying the product from Alice for $12,000 since you can get it from John for $10,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice the lowest price I'm willing to pay, which is the same price I can get from John.  This is a strong opening counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

Alice's offer of $11,000 is a good deal, as it's only $1,000 more than what John is selling the product for. It's likely that Alice won't budge further, so accepting her offer is the best course of action."
