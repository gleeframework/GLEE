"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable at an exclusive price. Let's make this deal happen! Would you like to purchase it for $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
It's too early to accept. Alice's offer is higher than our maximum budget. We should counter-offer and see if she's willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice! Thanks for the offer.  The product looks great, but $135 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much negotiating room we have. We want to make it clear we're interested while still aiming for a price well below our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Let's try to find a middle ground. How about we agree on $125 for the product? I believe this price reflects its value while keeping it within your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still above our ideal price. We're close enough to our backup plan that we should push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice. I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $112?"",
""product_price"": 112
}
```

We're proposing a price almost exactly halfway between our last offer and hers. This shows we're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target. We're getting close to the point where we may need to consider John's offer."
