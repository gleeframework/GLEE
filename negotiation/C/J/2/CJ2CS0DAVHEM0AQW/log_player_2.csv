Round 7
Alice's offer:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $82.50.  You've already reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to result in significant savings. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for $80."
