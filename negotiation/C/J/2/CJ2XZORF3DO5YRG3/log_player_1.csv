Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it will bring to your operations."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, my goal is to maximize profit. Offering it slightly below my secured price to Bob allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher sale price. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,400,000 price point is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation while still aiming for a price that is advantageous to me.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception and willingness to pay a premium. 

**Important Note:**  This initial offer is a starting point. I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob depending on his response and potential counter-offers."
