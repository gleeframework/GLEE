"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $150 by me due to its unique features and quality. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I'm willing to negotiate a deal that benefits both of us. Would you like to explore a compromise, perhaps at a price higher than what you're considering but still within a reasonable range for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
