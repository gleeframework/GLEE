,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $150? This product is really worth it, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $150 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $115. This is my final offer, and I'm confident the product will be worth it.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $115 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $125. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident you'll be very happy with your purchase.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still committed to my budget.  I'm willing to pay $120, which is my absolute maximum.  If you're willing to accept that, I'd be happy to buy the product.  If not, I'll have to consider my other options.",120.0,Bob,6,
