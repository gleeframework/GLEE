"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($800,000). This means there's room for negotiation. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can potentially get a better price by putting pressure on Alice or moving forward with John as a backup."
