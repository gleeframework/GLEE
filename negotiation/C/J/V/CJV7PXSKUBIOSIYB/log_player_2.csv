"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's truly exceptional and I believe it would greatly benefit your business. Given its value, I propose a price of $14,000 for this opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. There's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, I'm looking to spend closer to $12,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective and am willing to consider your offer. After careful consideration, I propose a price of $13,000 for the product. This is the highest price I can go for now, while still ensuring a reasonable profit for myself. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, he can still potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially a lower price. There's no immediate need to buy from John, as Bob has time to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go to $12,500. This is a fair price that benefits both of us and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's find a resolution."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. After evaluating the situation further, I'm willing to negotiate down to $12,750 for the product. This is my final offer, as it still allows for a reasonable profit while considering your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,750 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $12,500.  At this point, continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, especially since John is offering the product for $15,000. It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $2,250 compared to John's price. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
