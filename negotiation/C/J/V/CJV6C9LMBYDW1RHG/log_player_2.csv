"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really love.  I'm asking $115 for it, which is a great deal considering its value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

 Alice's offer is too high. I can try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $105 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $110? It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.

While Alice is meeting me closer to my price range, I still think there's room for negotiation before I go up to $110."
