# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its value to me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,125,000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and leaves room for mutual benefit.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal. I believe this is a strong offer that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
