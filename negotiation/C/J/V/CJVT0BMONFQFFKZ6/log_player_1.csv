Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair considering its value to me, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the product's value and allows us both to benefit from this deal. I believe this is a strong offer that we can both agree on.
