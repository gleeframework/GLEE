"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows for a significant profit for you, and it's a fair price given the product's worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,050,000. I'm offering $975,000. Can we meet at this price?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000.  This allows for a substantial profit for you, while still reflecting the product's true worth. Let's close this deal at this price.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
