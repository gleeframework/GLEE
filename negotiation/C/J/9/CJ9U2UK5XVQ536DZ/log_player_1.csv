Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially get closer to Bob's perceived value of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $9,200 is close enough to my target and secures a sale. Further negotiation might lead to a slightly higher price, but the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially forcing me to sell to John for a lower price is too high."
