"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $600,000 is significantly lower than the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? It's still a good profit for you, and a fair price for me. Let's work together to reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not acceptable to you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
