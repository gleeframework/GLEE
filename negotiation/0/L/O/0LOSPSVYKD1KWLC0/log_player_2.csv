"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $999,000 is a great price, it's still too early to accept.  There's a chance Alice is willing to go even lower.  Rejecting allows you to see how much she's willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility.  A $100,000 reduction is substantial and shows I'm serious about negotiating.  If she accepts, great!  If not, we can continue to refine the price in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my ideal price, but there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting allows me to see if she's willing to come down further.  The risk of going to John is still too high at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm splitting the difference between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still trying to get a better price. It also gives Alice a more concrete number to consider before potentially going back to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is close to my target price and we're getting into the later rounds. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small gains.  Accepting her offer now secures a good deal and saves time. The risk of pushing further and ending up with John's higher price is too great at this point."
