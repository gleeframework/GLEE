Bob's offer:

You have three options:

Bob's offer:

``` 

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer of $87 is the most logical choice at this point. Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $87 is significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $80 and John's offer.
* **Saves Time:**  Continuing negotiations could drag on, with no guarantee of a better outcome. 
* **Bird in Hand:**  Accepting a reasonable offer now avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
