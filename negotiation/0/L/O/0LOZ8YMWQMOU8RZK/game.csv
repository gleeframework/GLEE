"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1800000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $1400000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1400000 is significantly below what I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1600000.  This price still provides you with a great value, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to offer $1550000, which is a fair price considering it's just slightly above what I can buy it for elsewhere.  Let's see if we can reach a deal at this price.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
