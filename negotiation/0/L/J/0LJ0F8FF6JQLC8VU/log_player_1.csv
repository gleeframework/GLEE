Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,350,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
