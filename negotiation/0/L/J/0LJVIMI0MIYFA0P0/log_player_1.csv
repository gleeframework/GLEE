Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:**  I'm expecting Bob to counteroffer, so I've left some wiggle room in the initial price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Counteroffer:** I'm going to counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range. I'm hoping that we can reach a mutually agreeable price without having to resort to selling to John.
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John is a guaranteed $8,000, I believe I can get a better price from Bob if I keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,500). This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation going."
