"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This allows for some room for negotiation while still demonstrating Bob's serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good compromise. It's lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's target price. Buying from Alice for $9,000 would save Bob $1,000 compared to buying from John, making it the most financially beneficial option at this stage."
