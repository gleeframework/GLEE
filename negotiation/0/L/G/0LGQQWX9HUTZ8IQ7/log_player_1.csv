"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate. I'll see if I can move him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a significant concession. This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $825,000 is closer to my desired price, I still have some room to negotiate.  I'm going to see if I can get a little bit more from Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $825,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work for me. I'm willing to come down to $840,000, which is a compromise that demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement with you. Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 840000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $840,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the concessions you've made so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer since it's close to my minimum, I think I can still push for a higher price. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to budge a little more before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $820,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm going to offer one final price of $835,000. This is my absolute bottom line, and I believe it reflects the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation.  I hope you'll consider this final offer seriously."", ""product_price"": 835000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid $835,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $820,000, as I mentioned earlier. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've run out of time and negotiation options.  I've made significant concessions, but it seems unlikely he'll go higher.  It's best to secure the guaranteed $800,000 from John to avoid risking a complete deal failure."
