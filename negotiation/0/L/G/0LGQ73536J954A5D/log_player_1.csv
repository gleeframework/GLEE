Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,800,000. Let me know your decision - this offer won't last long!"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can aim significantly higher with Bob. 
* **Anchoring:** Starting with a high offer like $1,800,000 sets an anchor point in Bob's mind. Even if he negotiates down, the final price is more likely to be closer to your desired outcome.
* **Scarcity:**  Creating a sense of urgency (""this offer won't last long"") might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While we know the product's worth to Bob, he might not be willing to pay significantly more. This offer is a calculated risk.
* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a negotiation strategy in place will be crucial to maximize your profit."
