Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a strong opening price, leaving room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to find a price that's closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,050,000 is not within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, it seems like we're getting further apart rather than closer.  Given that John is willing to pay my minimum price, it's more advantageous to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
