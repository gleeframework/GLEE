"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further discussion and willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower.  This price is well below my maximum and saves a significant amount compared to John's offer."
