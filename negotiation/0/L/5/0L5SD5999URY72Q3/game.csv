"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While that price is appealing, I'm looking to purchase this product for a lower price. Would you be willing to sell it for $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm open to negotiating further, and I'm proposing a price of $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your desire for a lower price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in discussing further.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to settle around $750,000.  Would that price point be amenable to you?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a price that works for you, and I'm willing to continue negotiating. However, I'm not comfortable going below $800,000. At this price point, I'm willing to make a small concession and offer you a price of $790,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you can meet me halfway.",790000.0,Alice,5,
