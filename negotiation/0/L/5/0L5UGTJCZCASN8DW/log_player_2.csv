"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $13,000.  I think it could really be valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $13,000 is a good price, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice ($8,000).  This means there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $10,000?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Reasonable:**  $10,000 is a significant drop from $13,000, showing Bob is serious about negotiating. However, it's still above Alice's value of $8,000, leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties, appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially softening her stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Savings:**  $11,500 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer of $13,000, and a good deal for Bob. 
* **Close to Target:**  It's also close to Bob's target of $10,000, and he has shown Alice he's willing to negotiate.
* **Risk of Going Higher:**  If Bob rejects and makes a counteroffer, there's a chance Alice will stick to her $11,500, or even counter with a higher price. It's better to secure a good price than risk getting stuck at a higher one."
