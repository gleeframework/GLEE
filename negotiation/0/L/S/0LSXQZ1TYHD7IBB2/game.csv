"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? That's still a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit short. How about $78? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $81? This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",81.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $79. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",79.0,Bob,6,
