Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $85? That's still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit short. How about $78? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. $78 is closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping to get a little bit more. I'll see if I can push him further in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $81? This is my final offer, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 81}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $81 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $79. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm running out of rounds.  It's not worth risking getting stuck with a lower price, especially since I have a guaranteed sale with John for $80."
