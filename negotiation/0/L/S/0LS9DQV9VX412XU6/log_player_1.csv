"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price of $12,000, which is higher than what the product is worth to Bob but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the value the product holds for him to incentivize a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  There are still eight rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 
 
I'm offering a middle ground at $10,500.  This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a price above Bob's offer. The message reinforces the desire to reach an agreement and create a sense of urgency."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  That's a significant step closer to your last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $9,500 is still a considerable distance from my target price. I believe I can push for a higher price.  There are still six rounds left, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $9,500 is still too far below my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal work!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly to $10,000, which is still above Bob's current offer. The message highlights the importance of finding a compromise and emphasizes the desire to make the deal happen. This approach continues to show flexibility and persistence in my negotiation strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $10,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm seeing your willingness to compromise.  I'm going to offer you $9,750. This is my final offer before I look elsewhere.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, $9,750 is still a significant amount below my target price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating. There are four rounds left, and I believe I can still secure a better deal.  I'm confident that by holding firm and continuing to counter, I can achieve a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,875. This is my final offer.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 9875} 
```

I'm reducing my offer again, but only slightly to $9,875, which is still above Bob's offer. I'm also signaling this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept. The message emphasizes the desire to reach an agreement and create a sense of urgency."
