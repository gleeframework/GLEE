"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $12,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $13,000 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  Let's try $12,500.  It's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to finalize the deal at that price.",12500.0,Bob,4,
