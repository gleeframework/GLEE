Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($120) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $119 leaves a small window for Bob to feel like he got a slight deal if he's inclined to haggle, but still ensures a high profit for me.
* **Secure the Sale:**  While I have John as a backup, selling to Bob at $119 is more profitable than John's guaranteed $100 offer."
