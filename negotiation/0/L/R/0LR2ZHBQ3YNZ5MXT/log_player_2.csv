"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm confident that you'll find it valuable, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still a significant investment.  It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by making a counteroffer. There's a good chance Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $600,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 600000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to spend closer to $600000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer to $700,000, which is a significant compromise. At this point, buying from Alice at $700,000 is a better deal than buying from John at $1,000,000. There's always a chance Alice might be willing to go lower, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential for further savings."
