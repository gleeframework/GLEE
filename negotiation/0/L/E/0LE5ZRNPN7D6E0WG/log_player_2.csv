"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth more than $1,200,000 to you, but Alice's offer is too high.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
``` 

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price and represents a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's important to be bold and assertive in counteroffers, but it's also important to avoid setting a price that's too low and risking Alice's rejection outright."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price. It's not ideal, but it's better than buying from John for the same price. You're saving the time and effort of further negotiation, so accepting is the best choice."
