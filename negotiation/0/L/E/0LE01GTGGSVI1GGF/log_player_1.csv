Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to your $15,000 value as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but slightly below your guaranteed price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer. Even if he negotiates down, you're likely to still land a better deal than John's offer.
* **Gauge Interest:** The message aims to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's completely turned off by the price, you haven't lost anything as you have John as a backup."
