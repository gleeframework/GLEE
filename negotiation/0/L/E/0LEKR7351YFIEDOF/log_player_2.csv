"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $150 to you!  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can do better than $140. Since you value the product at $150 and Alice's cost is $120, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I agree it's a good deal, I'm aiming to get it for a bit less.  I'm happy to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you consider $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

$135 is a good deal, considering your value of the product is $150.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's unlikely Alice will drop much lower.  Accepting her offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
