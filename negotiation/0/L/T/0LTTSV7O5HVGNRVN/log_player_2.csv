"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product, and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering what I know you're willing to pay for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is a bit cheeky. She knows you're willing to pay $12,000 but trying to get a higher price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and find a better deal. This puts you in a stronger position for a potential counter-offer from Alice or to proceed with buying from John at your maximum price."
