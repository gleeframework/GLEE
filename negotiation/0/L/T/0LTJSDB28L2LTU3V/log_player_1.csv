Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget. To start, I'm willing to offer $10,000 for it. I understand this is a considerable difference, but I believe it's a fair starting point for negotiation.
