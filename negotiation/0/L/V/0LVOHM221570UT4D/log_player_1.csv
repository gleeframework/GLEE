Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This gives me a good starting point to negotiate from, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Bob. I'm hoping to get as close to his value as possible, but also want to make a profit for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my desired profit margin. I believe I can negotiate a better price, so I'll continue the negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise - it's closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit. I believe this price is fair and I'm hoping Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a decent profit for me and avoids any further negotiation that could risk losing the sale altogether.  I'm happy to close the deal at $9,500."
