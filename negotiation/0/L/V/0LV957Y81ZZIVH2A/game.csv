"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it worth your while. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go too far below this price. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I'm still finding it hard to justify that price. How about $760,000? I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",760000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $760,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering its true value to you. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
