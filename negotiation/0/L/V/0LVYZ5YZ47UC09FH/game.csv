"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I would receive from another buyer. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. It's a great product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure I can go above that.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $800,000 is simply too low for me. Considering the value you see in this product, I believe $850,000 is a fair compromise.  This price still leaves room for you to make a profit and allows me to earn a more reasonable return on my investment. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $850,000. How about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
