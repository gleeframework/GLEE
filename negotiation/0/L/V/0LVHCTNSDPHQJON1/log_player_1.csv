Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, knowing the product is worth $120 to Bob. This gives me room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm being friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm asking for his opinion, letting him know I'm open to discussion. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** I want to get as close to $120 as possible.
* **Keep Bob engaged:** A friendly tone and willingness to negotiate encourages him to counteroffer.
* **Have a backup plan:** I can always switch to John if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profit vs. Risk:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $100, $90 is still a good profit and above my minimum of $80.
* **Time and Uncertainty:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob introduces more risk. He might get frustrated, or another buyer might emerge.
* **Secure Deal:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a good profit. 

Selling to John at $80 would mean less profit, and selling to Bob for $90 offers a good balance between profit and certainty."
