Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefit it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob values the product significantly higher than John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

This strategy aims for the best possible outcome while still ensuring the sale."
