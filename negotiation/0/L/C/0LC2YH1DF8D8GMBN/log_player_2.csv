"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think you might be interested. I'm offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $95? "", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price close to Alice's value of $80. This shows Bob is serious about buying but wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. I could come down to $105 for you.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $105 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  There's room for further negotiation, so Bob should reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $100.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, showing he's willing to compromise. $100 is a reasonable price, considering Alice's value of $80 and Bob's budget of $120. This counteroffer gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much."
