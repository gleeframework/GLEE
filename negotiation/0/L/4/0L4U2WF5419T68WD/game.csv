"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to go to $1,050,000, which is a significant step towards your offer and still within my budget. This price is fair considering the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a good compromise. Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a slight compromise from my previous offer. I believe this price is still a good reflection of the product's value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
