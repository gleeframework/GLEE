Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go as high as $100. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $125. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to come down further and it's better to secure the product at the known price from John.  You're saving $25 and avoiding further negotiation."
