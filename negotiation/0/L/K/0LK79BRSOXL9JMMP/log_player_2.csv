"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Interested:** The message remains polite and expresses continued interest in the product.  
* **Aiming for Under $80:** Ideally, we want to get the product for less than what it's worth to Alice ($80). This offer gives us a starting point to potentially achieve that goal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price we like, $82 is still a bit too high. We're aiming to get below her perceived value of the product ($80). We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  I'm getting closer, but $82 is still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing Negotiation:**  We're signaling to Alice that we are still interested but want her to come down further in price.
* **Targeting Below $80:** We're sticking to our goal of getting the product for less than what Alice values it at. 
* **Compromise Language:** ""Meet in the middle"" suggests a spirit of compromise and might make Alice more receptive to our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $82 is still a bit too high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $79. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $79, which is just below her perceived value of the product. It's a good price and within our budget, so it's time to accept and close the deal. Pushing for a lower price might make Alice walk away."
