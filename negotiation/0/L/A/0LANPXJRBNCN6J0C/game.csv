"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While $9,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal and allows us to move forward.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, and I'm happy to continue negotiating. While $9,800 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Would you be open to $10,150? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10150.0,Alice,5,
