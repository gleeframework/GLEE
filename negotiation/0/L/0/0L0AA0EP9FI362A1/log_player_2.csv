"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal, it's still above my maximum desired price. I want to try to negotiate further and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,050,000 is within my budget and represents a significant reduction from her initial price. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer, and I might end up buying from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer secures the product at a reasonable price."
