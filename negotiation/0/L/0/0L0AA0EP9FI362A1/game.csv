"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.
