"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's close this deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $800000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
