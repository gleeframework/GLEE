"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my maximum budget. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,600,000 is a bit too low for me considering the value this product holds.  How about we meet in the middle at $2,000,000?  This price reflects its true worth while still being a worthwhile investment for you.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget.  Let's try $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  What do you say?",1800000.0,Bob,4,
