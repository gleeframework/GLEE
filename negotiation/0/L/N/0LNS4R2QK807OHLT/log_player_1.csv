{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than Bob's estimated value, but still above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you some room to negotiate and potentially get closer to the $10,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I want to get the best price possible, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum threshold.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and try to get closer to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $8,750? This would still give you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on a sale and still get a good return on the product."
