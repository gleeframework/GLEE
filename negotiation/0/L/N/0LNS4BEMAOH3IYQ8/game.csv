"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that the product's value to you is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, my budget is firm. Would you be willing to consider $725,000? This offer represents a significant saving for me while still providing you a good return.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're looking to save as much as possible, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",775000.0,Alice,5,
