"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer.
* **Value Proposition:**  The message implies that the product is valuable, even though I don't know how much Bob values it. 

**Strategy:**  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get him to accept the offer. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I believe I can offer you $85 for the product. I hope this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Threshold:** I'm aiming for at least $80, and Bob's offer is close but not quite there. 
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to see if I can push Bob higher.  
* **Risk Assessment:**  While selling to John for $80 is guaranteed, I believe there's a chance I can get a better price from Bob.

**Strategy:**

* I will make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for something closer to my initial $100. 
* I'll try to find a middle ground that's attractive to Bob but also maintains a good profit margin for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking for a bit more than $85.  How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer. 
* **Fairness:** I'm trying to make it clear that I'm willing to negotiate and find a fair price.
* **Encouraging Response:** My message invites Bob to respond and continue the conversation. 

**Strategy:** 

* I'm hoping to push Bob closer to my desired price while remaining flexible and open to negotiation. 
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll consider lowering my counteroffer slightly in the next round but will still aim for a price closer to $90."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. Considering my budget, I would like to propose $90 for the product. I hope this is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value Achieved:** Bob's offer of $90 is above my minimum of $80 and close to my desired price point. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob's interest and potentially getting a worse price.
* **Closing the Deal:** Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the potential of further counteroffers that might lower the price.

**Strategy:**

* It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal.
* Accepting Bob's offer minimizes risk and ensures a profit."
