"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high value and quality, I believe it's worth $100. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within my budget, I'm aiming to save as much as possible. I'll counteroffer to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm ready to offer $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to Alice's perceived value of the product. This will hopefully initiate a negotiation that allows me to secure a good deal without immediately resorting to John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your offer, I would like to counter with a price of $90 for the product. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to my target, but I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject her offer and see if I can get her down further with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. I'm still feeling a bit high at $90.  How about we split the difference and go with $87.50?  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.  I'm also emphasizing my interest in the product to potentially create a sense of urgency."
