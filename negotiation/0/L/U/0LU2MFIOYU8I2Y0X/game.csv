"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm confident this product is worth a lot to me, and I'm ready to close the deal at $1,025,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it reflects the value of this opportunity.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
