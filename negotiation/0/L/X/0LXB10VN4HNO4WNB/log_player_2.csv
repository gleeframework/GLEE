# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and potential for you.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer.  However, the value of this product significantly exceeds $750,000. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm very motivated to sell, but I need to get a fair price. How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  John offers a guaranteed price at that level, making further negotiation pointless."
