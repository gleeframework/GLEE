Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. 

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is appealing to Bob while maximizing your potential profit.  Here's a balanced approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can make a real difference in your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Start with a positive tone, highlighting the product's value to Bob.
* **Fair Price:** $1,350,000 splits the difference between your minimum and Bob's maximum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **No Floor:**  Avoid revealing your minimum price (John's offer).

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship is important, a more generous offer might be suitable. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or walk away knowing you have John's guaranteed purchase."
