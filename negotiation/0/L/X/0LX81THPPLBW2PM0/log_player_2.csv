"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to start with a price of $10000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's maximum price of $12,000. It's best to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9500. Is that something you'd be comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still within Bob's budget of $12,000 and closer to his counteroffer of $9,000. Accepting the offer saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for Bob, especially considering he has limited rounds to negotiate."
