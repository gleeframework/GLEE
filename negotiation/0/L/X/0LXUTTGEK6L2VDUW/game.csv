"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point, and I'm open to further discussion.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  I could consider letting it go for $900,000. This is a substantial reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the reply. I appreciate you working with me, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $700,000? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a compromise here, but $700,000 is still significantly below my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final concession at $850,000. This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's true value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
