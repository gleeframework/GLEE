"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value I place on it. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,250,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,300,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm prepared to offer $1,275,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product, and it's closer to my budget. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,285,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,285,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower. I'm willing to offer $1,260,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  What do you think?",1260000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the price as low as possible, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to the product's true value. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to see some more movement from you. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,280,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1280000.0,Alice,7,
