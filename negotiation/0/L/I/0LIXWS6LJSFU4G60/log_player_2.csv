Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  He should counter-offer Alice and try to get a better price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what he can get from John.  He should counter-offer again and try to get closer to his target price."

Alice's offer:

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's offer of $11,250 is still higher than what he can get from John, and it's unlikely she will come down further. It's better to secure the product from John at a lower price."
