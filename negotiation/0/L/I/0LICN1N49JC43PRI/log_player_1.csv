I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident it's worth at least $15,000 to someone with your needs.  Given its value, I'm offering it to you for $13,500.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value you place on the product at $8,000, I'm willing to offer $10,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high for my budget. Considering your own valuation of $8,000, I'm prepared to offer $11,000. This price is fair, and I believe it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.
