"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm for this product. However, $200 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Would you be open to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $175? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my initial offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find another buyer who's willing to pay more.",100.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is still a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we try $155? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal on this product.",155.0,Alice,5,
