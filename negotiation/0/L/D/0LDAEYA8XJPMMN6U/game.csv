"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",11000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750?  That's a fair compromise.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,750 is a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,250. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",10250.0,Alice,5,
