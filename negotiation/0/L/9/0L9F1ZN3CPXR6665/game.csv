"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a price that allows us both to benefit.  I understand its worth to you is $800,000, and while I value it at significantly more, I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000.  This is a great deal for you, and allows me to achieve a good outcome as well.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
