{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could continue to negotiate, Bob is consistently moving upwards in price, and we are now above the $1,000,000 mark. Accepting this offer guarantees a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  Continuing to push for a higher price carries the risk of Bob walking away, leaving us with John's lower offer as the only option."
