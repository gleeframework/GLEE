"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  I know you're interested and that this product is worth a lot to you.  Let me know if you'd like to move forward.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than her product's value to her, it's still more than what John is offering. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can leverage John's lower price and maximize your savings."
