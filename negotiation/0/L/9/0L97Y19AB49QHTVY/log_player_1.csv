"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what I know the product is worth to me. This allows for potential negotiation and still gives me a good profit. I'm also being friendly and optimistic, hoping to create a positive vibe for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I'd like to make a sale, I won't settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  This is still a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still maintaining a price that's profitable for me. I'm also emphasizing fairness to encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $120.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I'll counter with a slightly higher offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $120 is still a bit too low. How about we split the difference and settle on $130?  I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
I'm proposing a price that's closer to Bob's last offer while still ensuring I get a decent profit.  I'm also emphasizing fairness to keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm still only able to go up to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay.  Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$125 is close to my minimum acceptable price and still leaves me with a decent profit. I'm running out of rounds, and it's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price."
