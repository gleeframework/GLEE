# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1050000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges your budget while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
