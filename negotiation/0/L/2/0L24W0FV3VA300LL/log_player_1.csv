Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a steal at $13,500. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($12,000) as possible while still making a profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $13,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, but still within a range acceptable to you.
* **Time Value & Certainty:** Selling to Bob quickly might be preferable even if you could make a bit more from John, as it avoids the potential delays and uncertainties of finding another buyer. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you don't know for sure if Bob would accept a lower offer. If you had information suggesting he might go up to $14,000, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
