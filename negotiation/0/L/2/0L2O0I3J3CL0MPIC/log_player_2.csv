"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a fair price considering the value you'll get out of it. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, paying $8,500 to Alice is not a good deal. You can get the same product from John for a lower price."
