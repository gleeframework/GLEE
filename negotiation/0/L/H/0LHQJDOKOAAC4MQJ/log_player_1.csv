Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I'm interested, $1500000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
