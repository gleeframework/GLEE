"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. However, $9,800 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $10,500. This reflects the value of the product and allows us both to have a fair deal.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $10,500, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. I think that's a fair price for the product and I'd be happy to make a deal at that price.",10250.0,Bob,4,
