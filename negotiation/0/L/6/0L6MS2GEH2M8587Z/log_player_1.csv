"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.  I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
My reasoning:

I'm aiming for the best possible price. While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to accept it just yet. I'll send Bob a counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better deal. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. John's offer is a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's final offer of $920,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm not willing to settle for a price lower than my minimum, and I still believe there's a chance to get a better deal. I'll counteroffer one last time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. If that fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm aware of your budget constraints, and I've made several concessions.  I'm willing to drop my price to $980,000, which is just a bit above your last offer.  This is my final offer. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note."", ""product_price"": 980000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $980,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $920,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions and my budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've made significant concessions, and Bob's final offer is still below my minimum threshold. It's becoming increasingly clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement.  Therefore, I'll take John's offer of $1,000,000 to ensure I get a fair price for my product."
