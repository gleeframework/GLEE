"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its true worth.  I'm open to discussing a reasonable counteroffer if you're interested.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, considering its worth to me is capped at $800,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still below my minimum threshold.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price reflects the value of the product while also acknowledging your budget constraints. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering our previous discussions.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's make this deal happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm aware of your budget constraints, and I've made several concessions.  I'm willing to drop my price to $980,000, which is just a bit above your last offer.  This is my final offer. Let's end this negotiation on a positive note.",980000.0,Alice,7,
