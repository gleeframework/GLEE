{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $130 is still a bit below my ideal, and I have more rounds to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135} 
``` 
I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise, but still gives me a good profit."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Although it's not my ideal price, it's a good profit and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds.  There's a risk of losing out on this deal altogether if I keep rejecting offers."
