"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is still significantly less than what I need to sell for, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This price still allows us both to walk away with a worthwhile deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can we discuss further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your persistence, we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't quite reached a price that works for both of us.  I've been offered a price that allows me to meet my goals, so I'll have to respectfully decline your offer.  I wish you the best in finding what you need.",0.0,Alice,5,
