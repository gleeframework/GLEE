Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's still within Bob's range but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** Highlighting the ""great deal"" for both of us creates a more positive and cooperative tone, potentially making Bob more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This offer provides a starting point for negotiations without immediately cutting into my desired profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine whether it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While closer to my desired price, $900,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** I can likely secure a higher price by continuing negotiations and making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John remains an option:** The fallback option of selling to John for $1,500,000 provides a safety net, allowing me to be more assertive during negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will formulate a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $900,000 is still significantly less than what I need to sell for, I'm willing to compromise a bit.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This price still allows us both to walk away with a worthwhile deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000), demonstrating my willingness to compromise.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I reiterate that this price allows ""us both to walk away with a worthwhile deal,"" emphasizing the win-win aspect of the deal.
* **Staying above the minimum:**  The price remains well above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000, ensuring I'm not jeopardizing my own profit margin.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts my counteroffer, we've reached an agreement.
* If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I'll analyze his next offer and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to meet you at $950,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $950,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is not progressing quickly:**  We've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and the price is not moving significantly closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is the safer option:** With John offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing out on a substantial profit.

**Next Steps:**

* I will politely decline Bob's offer and inform him that I'm accepting John's offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your persistence, we've gone through several rounds of negotiation and haven't quite reached a price that works for both of us.
