"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is significantly more than Bob is willing to pay.  It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm offering the minimum I'm willing to pay for the product. This gives Alice a chance to consider my offer, and hopefully we can reach a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer of $125 is still more than what I'm willing to pay, but it's closer to my limit. It's worth accepting this offer and getting the product, rather than risking that Alice will reject my next counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at $100."
