Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price of $175.  This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to make a sale, I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price to $125. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, but still above Bob's valuation and my minimum acceptable price.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
