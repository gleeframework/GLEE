Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to significantly enhance your business operations and streamline your workflow. Given its value, I believe it's worth more than $10,000 to you. Considering its worth to you and its true market value, I propose we start our negotiations at $12,000. I look forward to hearing your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above my limit:** I'm only willing to spend $10,000.  
* **Negotiation is necessary:**  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price. 
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $10,000 provides a safety net."
