"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a lower price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Could you do $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upward if needed while aiming for a price closer to our $12,000 maximum.
* **Polite and Open:** The message is framed politely to maintain a positive negotiation tone, expressing interest while clearly stating our budget limitations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but we're still very close to our backup option of buying from John for $12,000. We have a little more negotiating power and can try one more time to see if Alice will meet us closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price that splits the difference between her latest offer ($12,500) and our previous offer ($11,000).  This shows willingness to compromise.
* **Framing as ""Fair"":**  By calling it a ""fair compromise,"" we nudge Alice towards accepting without being overly aggressive.
* **Nearing Our Limit:** We're getting very close to John's price. If Alice rejects this offer, we'll likely take John's deal unless Alice makes a significant concession."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,750 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that offer. How about we settle at $12,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price of $12,000. There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as we've reached the same price John is offering. We've successfully negotiated a good deal!"
