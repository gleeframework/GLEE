"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",11750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $11,750 is closer, I'm still unable to accept that offer. How about we settle at $12,000? This price would be a fair compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,5,
