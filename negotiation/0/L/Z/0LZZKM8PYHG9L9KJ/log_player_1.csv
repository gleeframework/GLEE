""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your starting price is a bit high. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $650,000.  I think this is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $650,000 is significantly below the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This still reflects a substantial discount and I believe is a very reasonable offer."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I believe my offer is more than reasonable. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to increase my offer to $720,000. This reflects my serious interest in the product while acknowledging the need for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly below John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit harder to see how serious he is."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see we're making progress. While I appreciate your revised offer, the value of this product is truly significant.  I'm willing to accept $860,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very fair price."",
""product_price"": 860000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're getting closer to John's offer, but I'm adding a bit of pressure by stating this is my final offer. This might push Bob to accept or at least counter with a much higher number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your final offer is tempting, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Let's make this deal happen â€“ I'm willing to offer $775,000.  This is a strong offer, and I believe it meets both of our needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is clearly hesitant to meet our price, and his counteroffers are increasing slowly. We're getting close to John's offer, and it's not worth the risk of Bob's next offer being even lower or hitting a stalemate. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
