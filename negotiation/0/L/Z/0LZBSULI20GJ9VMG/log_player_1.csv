Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits for you.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, Alice knows it's worth $1,200,000 to her and has a guaranteed buyer at that price. Starting with a higher offer ($1,150,000) leaves room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high initial price, even if Bob isn't aware of the full extent of its worth.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** The message encourages a response from Bob, allowing him to counter-offer and keeping the negotiation open. 

**The Strategy:**

This approach aims to find a price point between Bob's valuation and Alice's minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can always fall back on her guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000."
