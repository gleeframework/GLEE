"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us.",8750.0,Bob,4,
