"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,500 is still above Bob's maximum budget, and he has 10 rounds to try to negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, and I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than what Alice would accept. This allows for negotiation room while also indicating Bob's serious interest in the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, he still has room to negotiate further.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit steep.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a compromise price that is closer to Alice's last offer, but still lower than her proposed price. This shows willingness to negotiate while maintaining some leverage. It also avoids going too low and potentially risking Alice walking away entirely."
