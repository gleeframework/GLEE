"Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and counteroffering.  You have room to negotiate down from $11,000 and get closer to your target price of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are also willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  A $9,000 offer is a good starting point as it's a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still potentially profitable for her."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to your target price, there's still room for negotiation. Continue rejecting and counter-offering to see if you can push Alice down to a price closer to your goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

You're close to your goal, but you can try to squeeze out a little more.  A counteroffer of $9,500 shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but are also serious about wanting the product."
