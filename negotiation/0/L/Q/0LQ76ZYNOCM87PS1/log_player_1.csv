I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's still significantly more than the product is worth to Bob, but it's also less than my minimum acceptable price.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob isn't happy with the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I believe this is a fair price that still allows for a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm selling the product to John for $12,000. Bob's latest offer is getting closer, but it's still not quite at the point where I'd be comfortable accepting.  It's better to secure the guaranteed sale with John and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
