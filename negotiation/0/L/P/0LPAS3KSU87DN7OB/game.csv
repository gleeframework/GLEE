"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm not quite ready to go that high. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?  It's a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
