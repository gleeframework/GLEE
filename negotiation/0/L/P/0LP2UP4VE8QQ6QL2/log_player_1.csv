"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $115. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also reflects the fact that the product is worth more to Bob than it is to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's higher than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

I'm going to counter with $110.  This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves some room for profit."
