"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to me.  This sets the initial bar and gives me room to negotiate if necessary.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay top dollar right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I need to hold firm and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a good price for Bob, as he values it at $1,000,000, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping we can find a compromise in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to try to get closer to $1,100,000. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $1,050,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer, and I'm hoping it will encourage him to meet me in the middle. I'm also aware that time is running out, and I don't want to lose this deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers aren't getting any closer to my minimum acceptable price.  To avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely, I'm going to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, it's important to secure a deal."
