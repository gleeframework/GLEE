"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a significant discount to consider it. Would you be willing to come down to $6,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a discount, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. How about we settle on $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $9,000, but I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below your fallback price of $8,000. It makes more sense to buy from John at your target price rather than risk Alice increasing her offer again."
