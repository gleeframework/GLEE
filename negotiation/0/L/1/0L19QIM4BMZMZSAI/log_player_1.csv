"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $12,500, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I believe I can get a better offer if I continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  That's a good compromise, and it's still below the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $13,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $13,250 is a good compromise. It's worth risking a lower price for the certainty of a deal, rather than continuing to negotiate with Bob or selling to John at a guaranteed $15,000."
