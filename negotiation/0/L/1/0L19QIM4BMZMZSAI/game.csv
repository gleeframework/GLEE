"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  That's a good compromise, and it's still below the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'd like to counteroffer at $13,250. I think this is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?",13250.0,Bob,4,
