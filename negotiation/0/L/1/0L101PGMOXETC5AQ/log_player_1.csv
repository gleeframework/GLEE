"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Could you consider a price closer to $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $17,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $11,500.  Do you think we can find an agreement around there?

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the increase in your offer, $11,500 is still too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $15,500?"", ""product_price"": 15500}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your counter offer. While $15,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  To be honest, the most I can go is $12,000.  I understand if that's not feasible for you, but I'm hopeful we can make a deal.
