"Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $725,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",725000.0,Alice,3,
