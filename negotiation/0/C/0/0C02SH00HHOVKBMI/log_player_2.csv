"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's worth $800,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still a significant amount of money. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to come down further, especially since she's already offered a discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  It's still a good deal for you, and I believe we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $700,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of meeting you halfway and offering the product to you for $725,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down to $725,000, which is a good compromise.  Bob is still saving $75,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for both parties, and it's unlikely Bob will get a significantly lower price in further negotiations."
