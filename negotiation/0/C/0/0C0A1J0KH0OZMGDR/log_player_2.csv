"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for you. You should counteroffer to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more to me than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a compromise that I think will benefit both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to purchase the product from John, as his offer aligns with your maximum price.  You've reached a point where further negotiation with Alice is unlikely to yield a more favorable outcome."
