"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe this would still be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your business, $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!",140.0,Alice,3,
