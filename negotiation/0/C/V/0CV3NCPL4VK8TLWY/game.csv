I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000.,12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering I'm already willing to pay more than what John is offering.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, so I'll make a counteroffer of $10500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $10500. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $10000, which would be a missed opportunity for you.",11000.0,Alice,7,
