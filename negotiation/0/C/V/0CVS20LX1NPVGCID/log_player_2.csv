Round 9
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Alice is very unlikely to come down to $12,000. She's sticking stubbornly close to her price, and we're running out of rounds. It's better to secure the product at a known good price from John than risk Alice not budging any further."
