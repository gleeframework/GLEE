"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for a reasonable price. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $105. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, you can still try to negotiate further. You are aiming for $100 and Alice has shown a willingness to compromise.  You have more rounds, so continue trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $105 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay. I'm really interested in this product, and I'd be happy to buy it from you for $100. That's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $100 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $102.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $102.50 is still above your target price of $100. While there are more rounds, it is unlikely that Alice will agree to your target price. You've already made your final offer, and her counter-offer suggests she is unwilling to budge further.  It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John at $100 and save yourself more negotiation."
