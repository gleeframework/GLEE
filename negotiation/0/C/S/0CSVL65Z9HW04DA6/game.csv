"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $100 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $88.50. It's a fair compromise and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",88.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $88.50 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $90? I think this is a reasonable compromise considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,
