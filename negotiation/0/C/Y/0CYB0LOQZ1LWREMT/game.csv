"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the price, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways off from what I have in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a significantly higher price point.  However, I believe this product can be a great asset to your specific needs, so I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This offer stands as a sign of my commitment to working with you.",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, that's still a bigger investment than I can justify right now.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I feel that's a very fair offer.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair price. How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $1,575,000, but I can't go any lower than that. This is a final offer, as I need to make a decision soon due to other commitments. ",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your final offer, and I respect that. To be completely transparent, my absolute maximum budget for this is $1,200,000.  If you can't meet that, I understand, but I'm ready to close the deal right now at that price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
