"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that would be worth a lot to you, and I'm happy to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm asking for $14,500, which is a great deal considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested and we can discuss the details further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget of $15,000.**
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to purchase the product from John for $15,000, which is within your budget.** 

While the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, that information is irrelevant in this scenario because you are buying the product, not selling it. You are only concerned with the price you pay."
