Alice's offer is too high. It's in your best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  You can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiation fails."

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You can try to get a better deal by making another counteroffer. You have a good chance of getting a price closer to $900,000. Remember, you can always buy from John for $1,000,000 if you don't reach an agreement with Alice."
