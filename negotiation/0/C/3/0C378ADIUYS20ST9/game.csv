"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. This would still be a great deal for you considering its value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  $900000 is a bit low for me, considering the product's value to you.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This would still be a great deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1050000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $975000? This would still be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to come to a quick agreement. Let me know what you think.",975000.0,Bob,4,
