"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's priced at $1,400,000, reflecting its high quality and potential.  I believe this represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This reflects its value to me while also offering you a fair return on your investment. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still provides me with a decent return on the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. It's worth continuing to negotiate and try to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise. This will allow us both to make a good deal. Let's finalize this."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is still a bit too low, I'm prepared to meet you halfway. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's reach a final decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. He has already rejected a price of $1,250,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating and try to push for a lower price. There are still several rounds left, and Bob might be able to secure a better deal, potentially closer to his target of $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $1,200,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone. I'm prepared to go up to $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise that would allow both of us to achieve our goals.  I'm confident we can finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $1,185,000. This offer is a small compromise from my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,185,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,185,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,185,000 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $1,175,000.  It's within a reasonable range of Bob's ideal price point and a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a slightly lower price, but the risk of losing the deal altogether increases.  With only three rounds remaining, accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price close to his goal and avoids potentially needing to buy from John at a higher price."
