,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a more reasonable price. How about $900000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss $1200000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1000000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin for you while staying within my financial limits.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is the best price for this exceptional product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1000000 and $1200000, so I'll propose a price of $1100000. This is my final offer, but I'm open to discussing it further if you're willing to meet me at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1050000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target price. I'll propose a price of $1150000. This is my final counteroffer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1150000.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'll make one last concession, but I need to be very close to my target price. I'll propose a price of $1190000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can meet at this price.",1190000.0,Alice,9,
