,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $110 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and I'll go down to $115?  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $112.50. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I need to get a little bit more for the product. How about $113.75? This would be a great deal for both of us!  Let me know what you think.",113.75,Alice,5,

"I'm still not comfortable with the price, Alice. I'm willing to go down to $111.50. Can you meet me at that price?",111.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're determined to get a good price, but $111.50 is just a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $112.00. It's the best I can do, and it's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to go above $110. I'm willing to meet you at $110, and that's my final offer. Can you accept it?",110.0,Bob,8,
