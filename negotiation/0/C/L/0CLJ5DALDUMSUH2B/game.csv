"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to make a great deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for starting the conversation, Alice. That's a tempting offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $800,000.  Would that work for you?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $950,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $950,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I think $1,050,000 is my absolute minimum. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm sensing we're getting close.  To avoid dragging this out further, how about we split the difference and close the deal at $1,000,000 even?",1000000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept $1,000,000 just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think $1,025,000 is my final offer. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,7,
