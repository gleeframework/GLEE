Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to sell it for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,800 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower and getting stuck with a deal that doesn't meet my minimum requirements.  John is a guaranteed sale at $10,000, so I'll go with that option."
