Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. Given the value I'm placing on this product, I'm willing to offer $12,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? This reflects its worth while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $12,000. This is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Bob is clearly unwilling to budge from his $12,000 offer.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Selling to John for $15,000 ensures a guaranteed profit without further haggling."
