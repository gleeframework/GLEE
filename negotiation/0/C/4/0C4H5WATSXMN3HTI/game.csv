"I'm interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While $7000 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $8500? This reflects the unique value of the product, and it's a price point that I think we can both be happy with. Let's see if we can close this deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $7500.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'm willing to go down to $8000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",8000.0,Alice,5,
