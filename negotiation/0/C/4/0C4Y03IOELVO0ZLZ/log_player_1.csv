"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage.
* **Room for Compromise:** This price allows for several rounds of negotiation before I have to consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, $140 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum value:**  $125 is below my minimum price of $150. 
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic rejection:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and maintain leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $132.50? It's a fair price that benefits both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 132.50}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and helps keep the deal moving forward. 
* **Positive and persuasive language:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the price and framing it as a win-win for both of us. 
* **Maintaining a reasonable margin:** $132.50 is still above my minimum value of $150, allowing me to earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $132.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $130. If that's not acceptable, I'll have to consider my other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value:**  $130 is still below my minimum price of $150.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer shows that I am not desperate to sell. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** There is still a chance that I can get Bob to increase his offer. 
* **Negotiation is a process:** I want to see how far we can go before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's try $135. It's a fair price for both of us and keeps the negotiation moving forward.  I'm open to discussing it further if needed."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a slight increase:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's last offer, but keeping it within a reasonable range.

* **Open to further discussion:**  This shows flexibility and willingness to find a solution that works for both of us.
