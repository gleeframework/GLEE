Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:** Offering the product for $125 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's also a price that could be perceived as a ""deal"" compared to a higher starting point.
* **Above Bob's Value, Below John's:** This price targets a point where Bob might be tempted to buy, even if it's slightly above his perceived value.  Importantly, it ensures Alice gets more than the $100 Bob values it at.
* **Securing a Profit:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John for $150. This strategy aims to maximize potential profit."
