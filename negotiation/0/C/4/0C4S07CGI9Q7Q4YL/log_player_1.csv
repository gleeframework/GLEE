{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it'll be a great investment. My asking price is $950,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. It's early in the negotiation, and I believe I can push for a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a price closer to my initial offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its potential.  Let's find a mutually agreeable price and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. This is the highest price I'm comfortable with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation, as I believe we can reach a price closer to $900,000.  I'll counter again with a slightly lower price, but not too far below my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $875,000 is a good offer, I'm still a little off on the price.  I'm willing to go down to $890,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial."", ""product_price"": 890000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued flexibility, but $890,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $880,000 is now only $10,000 away from my minimum acceptable price of $870,000.  At this point, I'm concerned about running out of rounds and being forced to sell to John for $800,000.  It's a good deal, and I'm happy to close it."
