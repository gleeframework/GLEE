"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $130. It's a great deal for a product that's worth a lot more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $130, which is still too close to your maximum. 
* **You want to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start low:**  Your counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a good starting point for negotiation.
* **Be polite:**  A friendly message helps to maintain a good relationship with Alice.
* **Be reasonable:** $110 is still within your budget and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. While I appreciate your offer, $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's closer to your target, it's still more than what you're willing to pay. 
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You're confident you can get a lower price.
* **You have more rounds left.**  It's worth continuing the negotiation to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible. $120 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get it for $115. That's a fair price that would benefit both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Increase your offer slightly, showing you're willing to compromise.
* **Maintain politeness:**  Keep the tone positive and respectful to encourage Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Reiterate your value:** Emphasize that $115 is fair for both sides, appealing to Alice's self-interest."
