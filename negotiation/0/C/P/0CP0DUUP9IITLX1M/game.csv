"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price for the value of this product. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm prepared to go down to $875,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it shows my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $875,000, which would be $862,500. Can you consider this price?",862500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. However, $862,500 is still a bit too low for me given the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $865,000 as a final compromise.  Let's close this deal at this fair price.",865000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",825000.0,Bob,8,
