"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my purposes.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a different valuation of the product, but $2,000,000 is still too far out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant move from my initial offer.  I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting to increase his offer, but it's still significantly below both my minimum and John's offer. I'll counteroffer again to see if I can push him higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we are getting closer.  While I appreciate your willingness to come down, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is making more substantial increases, but $1,200,000 is still less than John's offer. I believe there's room for him to go higher. I'll hold firm for another round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your approach to this negotiation.  To meet you halfway, I'm proposing a final offer of $1,500,000. This reflects the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. It's a fair deal considering its unique value."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm holding firm at my minimum acceptable price, which matches John's offer. This puts the decision firmly in Bob's hands and avoids leaving potential profit on the table if he's willing to go higher."
