"Alice, your initial offer is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This reflects the maximum value I see in the product for my purposes.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider the initial offer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you have a different valuation of the product, but $2,000,000 is still too far out of my range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, which is a significant move from my initial offer.  I believe this demonstrates my genuine interest in the product, and I'm hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
