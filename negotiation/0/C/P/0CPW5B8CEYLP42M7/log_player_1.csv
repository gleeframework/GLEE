"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $18,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not going to accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16500}
```

I'm counteroffering with $16,500. This is still a decent profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer, hopefully prompting Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has finally offered my minimum price.  While I'd love to push for more, it's better to secure the deal at this point than risk losing him and being forced to sell to John at the same price."
