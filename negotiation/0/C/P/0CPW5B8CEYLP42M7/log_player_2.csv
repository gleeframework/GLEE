{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is $18,000, which is more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to get the best deal possible while staying within his budget.  He starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, hoping to initiate a negotiation. This counteroffer is still below Alice's minimum value for the product, but it leaves room for compromise and potentially finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum.  Bob is still seeking to save as much money as possible, and he has 7 rounds left to negotiate.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows him to continue exploring the possibility of a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now at his maximum budget. By offering $15,000, he's indicating his willingness to close the deal, but he's still trying to get the best possible price. This is a firm offer, and if Alice rejects it, Bob can move to John and secure the product for the same price."
