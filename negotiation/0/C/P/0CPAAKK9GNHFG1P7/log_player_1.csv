I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate.  I'm confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000 to me, and I believe there's potential for Bob to find it valuable enough to pay a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's not even close to my minimum value of $1,500,000. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,750,000.  This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I place on the product.  I hope this encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not acceptable. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer. I'm starting to feel like I might be better off selling to John.  But I'm going to give Bob one more chance to come closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This is my final offer. I'm lowering the price again to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping Bob will finally accept. If he doesn't, I'm going to sell the product to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob.  I've made significant compromises, but he's still not meeting my minimum value. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John. While I'm not getting my desired price, I'm at least ensuring I get my minimum value for the product."
