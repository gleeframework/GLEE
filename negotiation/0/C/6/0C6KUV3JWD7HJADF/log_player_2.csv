Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```

At this point, Alice has shown she's unwilling to go lower than $110, which is still above my budget. It's getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk going another round and potentially losing the chance to buy from John.  I'll go with John's offer of $80."
