(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I think I've pushed Bob as hard as I can, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Bob's offer of $800,000 is already at the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him. I'll sell the product to Jhon for $800,000, which is still a decent profit for me."
