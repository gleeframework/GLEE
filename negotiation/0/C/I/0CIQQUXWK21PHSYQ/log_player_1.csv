Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of offering $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to take his offer, I can still hold out for a higher price, and I'm not desperate to sell.  I'm going to see if I can get closer to my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original asking price. How about $9,000? That gives you a good deal, and it's still fair to me."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm still holding out for a better price.  I'm not desperate to sell, and I think I can get closer to my original asking price if I keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I can't go below $8,750. That's a fair price for both of us, and it's still a good deal for you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $8,500 again? I think it's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is being stubborn and I've already offered a pretty decent price.  I'm worried that if I keep going back and forth, I'll end up selling it to him for even less than what I'd get from John.  It's better to cut my losses and sell to John now."
