"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth a substantial amount to you, and I believe we can find a price that benefits us both. I'm offering it to you for $1000000.  This is a significant price point that reflects the value it holds for you, while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit.  Consider this your chance to acquire a product that can bring significant returns.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Your Value:** $1,200,000
* **John's Price:** $1,200,000

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $200,000 compared to buying from John. While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, accepting her offer ensures a purchase at a price significantly lower than your maximum value."
