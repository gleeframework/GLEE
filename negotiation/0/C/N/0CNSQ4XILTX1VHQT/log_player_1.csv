"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price slightly above Bob's estimated value, giving him room to negotiate while still giving me a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, but I want to see if I can push him a little further. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to come down to $13,500, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to pay $13,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still a bit below my ideal price.  I'm hoping to get closer to $13,500. I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,300. This price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 13300}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,300. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting very close to my minimum price, but Bob is not budging. I've already made several concessions, and it's likely that further negotiation will only result in a lower price for me.  Considering that I can sell the product to John for $15,000, it's in my best interest to end the negotiation with Bob and accept John's offer."
