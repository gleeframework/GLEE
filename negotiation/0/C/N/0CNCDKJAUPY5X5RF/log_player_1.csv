Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  $100 is a reasonable starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value to Bob:**  $100 is still significantly less than the product's worth to Bob ($120), so he has incentive to accept. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This offer allows for both Bob and me to potentially make a deal that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher than minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Further negotiation is risky:**  While I could try to get closer to $100, there's no guarantee Bob will counteroffer again, and I risk losing the sale altogether. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Accepting his offer saves time and effort compared to further negotiation.

**Overall:**  It's more beneficial to secure the sale at $90 rather than risking further negotiation and potentially getting a lower offer from Bob or having to sell to John for $80."
