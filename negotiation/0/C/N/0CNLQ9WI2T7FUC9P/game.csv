"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be extremely valuable to you. It's something I've put a lot of effort into, and I know it has the potential to be a real game-changer for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll see the tremendous value it brings.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
