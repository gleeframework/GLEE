Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't rationally pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000. 

**The Strategy**

The key is to offer Bob a price that's attractive enough for him to accept, but also maximizes your potential profit.  Going too close to $1,200,000 leaves money on the table.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  Starting with a price closer to your guaranteed amount gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly reminds Bob of what's at stake if he rejects the offer.
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:**  This positions the price as reasonable and encourages a collaborative negotiation rather than a confrontational one. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters. You have some wiggle room, but don't go below your $1,500,000 guarantee.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While John provides a safety net, mentioning other potential buyers could create a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob closer to your initial offer."
