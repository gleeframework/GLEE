Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially offering it to you for $1,500,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing the price further."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, starting with a higher price of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit for Alice. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message indicates openness to discussion, signaling to Bob that there might be flexibility in the final price.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 from John, eliminating the risk of not selling the product. 

This strategy aims to maximize Alice's potential profit while ensuring the product is sold."
