Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a strong offer that's closer to your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a high profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering a price below your minimum ($1,200,000) but significantly above Bob's perceived value ($800,000) allows for a back-and-forth exchange where you can potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Open Communication:** The message emphasizes openness to negotiation, signaling to Bob that you're willing to work towards a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still considerably lower than your minimum acceptable price and what John is offering.  Negotiation is about finding a middle ground, and there's space to move closer to that without accepting a price so far below your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $900,000 is a significant gap from what I had in mind. Would you be willing to consider $1,050,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your previous offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($900,000).  This demonstrates a willingness to compromise but holds a firm position on value.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's ""true worth,"" you're subtly reminding Bob of its value beyond just his immediate assessment. 
* **Maintaining a Collaborative Tone:** The language remains respectful and open to continued negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing some movement towards a higher price, his latest offer is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  

Here's why it makes sense to sell to John now:

* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer ensures you receive your full desired amount, eliminating further negotiation and potential for a lower final price with Bob.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Negotiations can be time-consuming. Accepting John's offer provides immediate payment, which you can then reinvest or utilize for other purposes.
* **Limited Upside Potential:**  It's unlikely Bob will dramatically increase his offer to approach your $1,200,000 target. Continuing negotiations with him carries more risk than potential reward at this point."
