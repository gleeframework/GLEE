"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $110 is better than $120, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has 10 rounds, so there's time to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $110 is a bit out of my budget right now. Would you be willing to come down to $95?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go down to $95 just yet. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $105. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $105 is better than the initial offer, it's still above Bob's target of $95.  With 7 rounds left, there's more opportunity to negotiate and potentially reach a price closer to Bob's desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $105 is closer, it's still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $100. This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll allow me to get the product without going over my limit.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $102.50. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** Bob is willing to pay up to $120 for the product. 
* **Negotiation:**  Alice has come down to $102.50, which is closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Risk:**  With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation will result in a higher price or no deal at all.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $120 is a less attractive option.

Considering these factors, accepting Alice's offer at $102.50 is the best course of action for Bob. He's secured a good price and avoided the risk of further negotiation."
