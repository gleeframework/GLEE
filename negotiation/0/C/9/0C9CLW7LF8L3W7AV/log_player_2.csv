"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and we're eager to share its benefits with you. Let's make this a win-win situation. My initial offer is $95 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice is starting high. There's room for negotiation to get a better price. Let's see what she's willing to come down to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming for a price well below $95. Starting with a counteroffer of $70 gives us room to negotiate upwards while still potentially getting a great deal. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message keeps the tone positive and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your interest, Bob! I understand your perspective. To reach a fair agreement, how about considering my product for $80? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down $15, showing she's willing to negotiate.  However, there's still a gap between her offer ($80) and our target price. Let's continue negotiating and see if we can get closer to $70."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer suggests a compromise and aims to close the gap quickly. 
* **Direct and Clear:**  The message is straightforward and proposes a specific price point. 
* **Still Room to Negotiate:** While $75 is our target, we've left a little wiggle room in case Alice pushes back slightly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're finding common ground here, Bob. Considering your feedback, how does $77.50 sound for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $77.50 is a solid price, saving us $22.50 off the original offer and $2.50 off our target.
* **Time Consideration:** We're halfway through the rounds. While we could push for a few more dollars off, there's a risk Alice won't budge much further.  
* **Avoid Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Continuing to negotiate aggressively might lead Alice to walk away, and we'd have to buy from John for $100.

Overall, accepting $77.50 balances getting a good price with the risk of potentially losing the deal."
