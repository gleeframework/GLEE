""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, increasing your profit.
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John gives you leverage. You don't need to desperately lowball the price.

**Why not higher?**  While closer to $15,000 might be tempting, it increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer outright. 

**Why not lower?** Going much lower than $12,000 leaves potential profit on the table. Bob is clearly willing to pay a premium for this product."
