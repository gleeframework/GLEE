{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I begin with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation or for Bob to accept if he's eager. 
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency can nudge Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the higher price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Instead of focusing solely on the price, I highlight the product's value, subtly justifying the cost.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** If Bob is very price-sensitive, this initial offer might be too high. It's a balancing act between maximizing profit and ensuring a successful sale.
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net. Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm guaranteed to sell the product at my minimum acceptable price."
