Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to discussion. However,  $1,150,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.
