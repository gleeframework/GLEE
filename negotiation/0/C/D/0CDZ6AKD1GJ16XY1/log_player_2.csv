"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's ideal price range. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to agree to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his maximum budget. There's still room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Since Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, continuing to negotiate is the best option."
