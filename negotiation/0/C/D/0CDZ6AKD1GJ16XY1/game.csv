"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth, but I'm open to discussing further.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to discussion. However,  $1,150,000 is slightly higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which I believe is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to agree to.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant gain.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000.  This offer is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from the deal. ",1075000.0,Bob,4,
