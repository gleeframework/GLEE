"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product *is*. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  The option to sell to John for my minimum price gives me a strong fallback position, allowing me to be more assertive in the negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unacceptable Offer:** $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and even his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). Accepting would be a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:** There are still 8 rounds left, giving us ample opportunity to find a price that works for both parties. 
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000 allows me to confidently reject this low offer. 

I'll prepare a counteroffer for Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, your offer significantly undervalues the true potential of this product. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** While I'm lowering my price by $350,000, I'm still aiming high to leave room for further negotiation.  
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the ""true potential"" to nudge Bob closer to his $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer will help me understand how serious Bob is and how much he's willing to move from his initial lowball offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart. I can appreciate the value of this product, but I need a price that works for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached Bob's Valuation:** Bob has now reached his perceived value of the product. This is a good sign, but it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Potential for More:** There's a decent chance Bob might be willing to go slightly above his initial valuation, especially if I hold firm and highlight the product's benefits. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm still comfortable rejecting this offer because I know I have John as a guaranteed buyer at a higher price.

I'll use my next counteroffer to try and bridge the gap without going below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price. Let's find a middle ground. If you're serious about acquiring this, I'm willing to accept $1,700,000."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 from my previous offer but staying firmly above my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating ""If you're serious about acquiring this,"" I'm subtly introducing a sense of urgency and implying that this is a limited-time offer.
* **Seeking a Middle Ground:** The phrase ""find a middle ground"" suggests flexibility while still aiming for a price that benefits me. 

I believe this offer balances firmness with flexibility and might be enough to encourage Bob to make his final move."
