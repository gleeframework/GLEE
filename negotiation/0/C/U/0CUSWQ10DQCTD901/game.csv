"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $105.  What do you think?",105.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I can't go as low as $105.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",107.5,Bob,4,
