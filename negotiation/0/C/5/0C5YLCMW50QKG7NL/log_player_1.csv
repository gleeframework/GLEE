Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I make it available to others. Considering its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you seem more flexible if you lower the price later.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, you are subtly reminding Bob of its worth, justifying the higher price.
* **Urgency:**  By implying the product will go to someone else, you create a sense of urgency that could encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains conversational, implying you're open to discussing the price further should Bob counter-offer.

While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium to secure it immediately. This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still leaving you the option to sell to John for your minimum price."
