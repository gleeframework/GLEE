"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for concessions.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" without being overly specific. This helps justify the high initial price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I frame the price as a ""starting point"" and invite Bob's thoughts, signaling a willingness to negotiate. 
 
By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity.**
2. **Maximize potential profit** if Bob is willing to meet the price or close to it. 

Even if this offer is rejected, it sets the stage for a potentially favorable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is far above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, but I'm confident we can find a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's good to see him engaging in the negotiation, accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.

I'll reject his offer and prepare a counteroffer for Round 3. My counteroffer will aim to close the gap while still keeping the negotiation moving in a positive direction."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,200,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered and allows us both to walk away with a beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  I'm making a significant concession of $250,000 from my initial offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm still keeping my offer well above both Bob's offer and my minimum price. This reinforces the product's value and maintains a strong negotiating position.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  By moving to $2,000,000, I'm aiming to encourage Bob to make a more substantial counteroffer and move closer to a mutually agreeable price point. 
 
The goal is to signal that I'm serious about finding a deal but not desperate to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $2,000,000 is still outside my price range. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you've stated and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could potentially push for a slightly higher amount in subsequent rounds, there's no guarantee of reaching a better deal. 

Here's why accepting now is strategic:

* **Meeting My Minimum:**  This offer ensures I don't make a loss and aligns with the value I place on the product.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the risk of protracted negotiations and allows me to reinvest the capital sooner. 
* **Relationship Building:** Accepting a fair offer demonstrates goodwill and could lead to positive future interactions with Bob. 

While there's always a chance of getting slightly more, accepting the current offer balances potential upside with the certainty of a favorable outcome."
