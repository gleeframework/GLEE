"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen to buy, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your position.  However, $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value. Could we meet somewhere in the middle, say at $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  While $800,000 is a tempting offer, I can't go that low. I'm willing to make a significant move to $900,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering its potential value.",900000.0,Alice,5,
