Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $750,000. This is the final price I'm willing to consider.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Price is Right:**  $750,000 is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and a good deal overall. 
* **Limited Rounds:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation window. Pushing further risks losing the opportunity for a decent price.
* **Alternative is Worse:** John's offer at $1,500,000 is significantly higher. 

While we might be able to squeeze a little more out of Alice, it's getting risky. Accepting now secures a good deal."
