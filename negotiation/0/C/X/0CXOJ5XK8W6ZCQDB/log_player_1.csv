"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  This offer leaves $500 on the table for Bob, giving him an incentive to negotiate rather than immediately rejecting.
* **Strategic Backup:**  By having John as a backup buyer, I'm not pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Value:**  While Bob's offer is better than John's, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.
* **Negotiation Power:**  By rejecting, I demonstrate my willingness to walk away, which strengthens my position in the negotiation.
* **Potential for Compromise:**  There's still room for us to meet in the middle. A counteroffer gives me the chance to explore a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer splits the difference between my initial offer of $9500 and Bob's offer of $8500. 
* **Reasonable Compromise:**  It demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Maintaining Value:**  This price still gives me a decent profit while keeping Bob interested in continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value:** Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will walk away completely, leaving me with no sale.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, it's more advantageous to secure the deal and avoid the possibility of a long, drawn-out negotiation."
