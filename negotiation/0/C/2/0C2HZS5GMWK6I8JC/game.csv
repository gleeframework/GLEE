"I'm interested in the product, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and features.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest. While $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to come down to $19,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product.",19000.0,Alice,3,
