Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8750. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great compromise.

Alice's offer is $8,750, which is within your budget of $10,000 and saves you money compared to buying from John.  It is also a reasonable compromise after your counteroffer was rejected."
