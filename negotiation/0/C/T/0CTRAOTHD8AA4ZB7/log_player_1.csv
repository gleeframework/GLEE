"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him of the potential benefit he'll gain.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm ending with a friendly tone, inviting Bob to discuss the offer and potentially negotiate. 

This approach aims to secure a good starting point while also leaving room for potential counteroffers and concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  
* **Negotiation is Possible:** While Bob's offer is low, it's clear he's interested and willing to negotiate.  
* **Potential for a Better Outcome:**  I'm still early in the negotiation process, and I believe I can likely secure a higher price with a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain the potential to reach a more favorable deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This takes into account your interest in the product and allows us to potentially close a deal. Let's work towards a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Reasonable Reduction:** I'm lowering my price by $100,000, demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm on a price closer to my minimum. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm emphasizing that this counteroffer is a step towards finding a solution that works for both of us. 
* **Open Communication:** I'm maintaining a friendly and open tone, encouraging further dialogue and negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between getting closer to Bob's price while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and pay $950,000. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob has increased his offer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  The fact that Bob continues to negotiate shows he's genuinely interested. There's still potential to secure a better price.
* **Opportunity for a Counter:**  I'm still early in the negotiation process, and I have a few more rounds to work with. I can likely counter with a slightly lower price, pushing Bob closer to my desired range.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price exactly halfway between my previous counteroffer ($1,100,000) and Bob's latest offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:** I'm framing this offer as a ""fair compromise"" that benefits both parties. This appeals to Bob's sense of fairness and could make him more inclined to accept.
* **Open to Discussion:** I'm ending with a question, inviting Bob to engage in further discussion and potentially agree to the offer.

This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob closer to my target price while remaining reasonable and demonstrating a commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Is that something you'd consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:**  $900,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only four rounds left, the likelihood of reaching a mutually acceptable agreement with Bob is becoming increasingly slim. 
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

Given the current negotiation situation, it's more strategically sound to sell to John and secure my target price."
