Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your needs. I'm willing to part with it for $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it slightly below that at $950,000 creates a sense of a deal for Bob while maximizing your potential profit.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** Highlighting that this is a limited-time offer before you move to another buyer (John) encourages Bob to act quickly and perceive the offer as more valuable. 
* **Justification of value:**  While you don't want to reveal John's offer, implying that the product has high demand and other interested parties subtly reinforces the price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob. However, it's crucial to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate if he shows resistance to the initial offer."
