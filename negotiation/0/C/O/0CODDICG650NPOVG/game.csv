"Hello Bob, I have a unique opportunity to sell you a fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm open to negotiating the price, but I was thinking of starting at $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000.  This is my top offer, and if you're not willing to budge, I'll have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your top offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still too much for me.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $8,000.  If you're not willing to accept that, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise a bit further. I'm now offering the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still out of my budget.  I'm going to stick with my original offer of $8,000.  This is my final offer, and if you're not willing to accept it, I'm going to have to go with another seller.",8000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",10000.0,Alice,7,
