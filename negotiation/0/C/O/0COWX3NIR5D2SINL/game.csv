"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only consider a price closer to $5,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 was a bit of a stretch for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $9,000 is the lowest I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again.",9000.0,Alice,5,
