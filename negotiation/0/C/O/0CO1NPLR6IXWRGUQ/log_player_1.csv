Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $150,  selling to Bob at a higher price is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering a price of $145 is a strong starting point. It's significantly less than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob, while still netting Alice a profit above her minimum.
* **Open Negotiation:**  The message is phrased to encourage negotiation. If Bob rejects the offer, there might be room to go slightly lower while still staying above the $150 minimum."
