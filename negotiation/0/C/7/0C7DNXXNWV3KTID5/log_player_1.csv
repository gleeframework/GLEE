"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $10,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is too low for me, especially since I know it's worth $12,000 to him.  I have 8 more rounds to go, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the product's worth.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
