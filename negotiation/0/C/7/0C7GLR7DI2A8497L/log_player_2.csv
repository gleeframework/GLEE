"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.  You're willing to pay up to $800,000, and rejecting the offer allows you to explore if you can negotiate closer to that price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This will put pressure on her to negotiate.  I'm aiming for a price closer to my maximum of $800,000, but I'm leaving room for negotiation in case she needs to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still not quite where I want to be. I'm going to try to squeeze out a bit more by rejecting her offer and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 710000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about getting this deal done, but I'm still holding firm to my goal of getting the price below $800,000.  I believe this is a good middle ground that Alice might be willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price of $800,000. I'm willing to accept this offer since it's a good deal and saves me some money compared to buying from John. There's a chance I could negotiate further, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it at this point."
