Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $110, which is slightly higher than my minimum value of $100. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm phrasing the message in a way that suggests I'm open to negotiation, which may encourage Bob to make a counteroffer. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I will evaluate his counteroffer and consider whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.  I will also keep in mind the option of selling to John for $100 at any point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value.**  I'm not willing to sell the product for $65, as it's below my minimum price of $100.
* **Negotiation is still possible.** While Bob's offer is too low, it shows he's interested. I'll proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price point. 
* **Keeping John in mind.** I'm aware that John is a reliable buyer at $100, which gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest! $65 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $90? That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while protecting my interests.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob that $90 is still a good deal for him, encouraging him to consider the value of the product.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to maintain a good relationship with Bob during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $90 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you do $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.**  While he's shown some willingness to negotiate, $75 is still not acceptable.
* **John offers a guaranteed profit.**  Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is above my minimum and a more reliable option than further negotiation with Bob.
* **Limited Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could take more time and effort without a guarantee of a better deal. 

It's important to balance the desire for a higher price with the certainty of a sale and the time investment required.  Selling to John is the most sensible choice at this point."
