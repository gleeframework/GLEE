"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I believe this strategy will encourage Bob to engage in a counteroffer, allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still far below my desired price. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can potentially get closer to my desired price. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal with Bob, making it more worthwhile to continue the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. However, I'm staying firm at $1,000,000, which is still closer to my desired price than Bob's offer. This should encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price, especially since he's already shown interest in the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm determined to reach a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value. I believe with some strategic negotiation, I can potentially get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise, but also reinforces that I'm not desperate to sell at Bob's price. By keeping the price above $950,000, I'm leaving room for further negotiation while also pushing Bob closer to my desired price.  I believe this is a strategic move that will encourage Bob to accept my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Despite getting closer to my desired price, Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. With only four rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a satisfactory agreement with Bob is high.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John rather than risk losing out on a potentially better deal."
