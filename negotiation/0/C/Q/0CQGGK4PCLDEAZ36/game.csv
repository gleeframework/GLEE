"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it has the potential to significantly benefit your business. I'm confident the value it brings will far exceed the price I'm asking.  My initial offer is $1000000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, based on my current budget and assessment of the product's worth, I am unable to meet the price of $1000000. I would like to propose an offer of $850000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $850000 doesn't quite meet my expectations for this unique product.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $925000. This reflects the value I know this product can bring to your business, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",925000.0,Alice,3,
