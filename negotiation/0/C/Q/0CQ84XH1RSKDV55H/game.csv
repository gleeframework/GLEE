"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $800,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, I'm not quite ready to commit to $750,000.  I'd like to offer $700,000, as I believe that's a fair price considering my budget constraints. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $725,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll offer $712,500.  This represents a significant savings for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",712500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to save some money, but I'm still not willing to go below $725,000. I've already compromised a lot by coming down from my initial offer, and I'm not comfortable going any lower. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $722,500. I think this is a fair price that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",722500.0,Alice,5,
