Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130?

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'd like to make a sale, $130 is too low for me.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $130 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $155? That would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 155}

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $140 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - how about $145? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $142 is close enough to my minimum price and I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John at a lower profit."
