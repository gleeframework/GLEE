"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point as it's a significant profit for me, but still leaves room for negotiation and potential for Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and leaves less profit for me. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's slightly above my minimum, it's still not a profitable enough deal. I'll counteroffer again, hoping to get closer to a mutually beneficial price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is getting closer to Bob's offers, and hopefully encourages him to come closer to my desired price. I'm still confident in getting a good price, and don't want to risk losing the deal by delaying further."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,750. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, showing that I am willing to negotiate further. However, it's still above Bob's last offer and closer to my desired price. With only a few rounds left, I need to find a compromise."

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only two rounds remaining, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is high. While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and a profit above my minimum."
