"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer is way above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, I'm really interested in your product, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer of $150 is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $100.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price.  Buying from John for $100 guarantees Bob gets the product within his budget and saves time."
