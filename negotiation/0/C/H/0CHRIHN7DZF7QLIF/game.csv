"Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's make a deal!",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've placed on the product and the initial offer I made.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,000. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're still a bit apart on the price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I can offer you the product for $10,500. This is my final compromise, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a good compromise, and I'm confident that it's a fair price for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're still not quite there, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm not sure if we can go any lower than this, so I hope this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Alice,7,
