Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,900,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1900000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you come down in price. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, you're setting a high anchor point. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it can influence his perception of what's reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for John:** While you have a guaranteed offer from John, it's always best to try for a higher price. If negotiations with Bob fail, you can always fall back on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,900,000 price point. Would you be willing to consider a counteroffer of $1,400,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. You have some negotiating room before you need to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While we're getting closer, the value of this product to my business necessitates a higher price. Could you consider $1,700,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price significantly above both Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Maintaining Value:** The message reiterates the product's value, subtly justifying the higher price. 
* **Strategic Movement:**  By decreasing your offer by $200,000, you're signaling flexibility but also indicating that you're not desperate to make a deal at any cost."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value you place on the product, but unfortunately, I cannot exceed my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and provides a profit of $100,000. While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob might walk away.  It's generally better to secure a good deal than to risk losing it for a potentially small increase."
