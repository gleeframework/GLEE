Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm open to negotiating a fair price. My initial offer is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$15,000:** This is a starting point. It's above your minimum value, but allows room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** This is friendly and sets the tone for a positive negotiation. It also emphasizes the value of the product without revealing too much.

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Strong opening:** This price shows you value the product, making Bob more likely to take you seriously.
* **Openness to negotiation:** This creates a sense of fairness and encourages Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing you to potentially reach a higher price.
* **Positive language:**  This makes the interaction less confrontational and more conducive to a successful deal.

**Next steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! You've made a successful sale.
* **If Bob rejects:**  You'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if you're willing to accept it or counter further. 
* **At any time, you can also choose to sell to John for $10,000 if you feel the negotiation with Bob is not going well.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $8000 for this product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum value of $10,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Counteroffer:**  You can try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, potentially closer to your desired range. 
* **Assess Bob's seriousness:**  His low offer might indicate he's not truly interested in the product, or he's trying to get a bargain.  A counteroffer will help you understand his true intentions.
* **Keep the negotiation open:** Rejecting this offer doesn't completely shut down the deal. You still have the opportunity to reach an agreement that works for both of you. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Prepare a counteroffer:** You need to decide on a price that you're willing to accept. Consider factors like Bob's budget, your own needs, and your willingness to continue negotiating. 
* **Be strategic:**  Your counteroffer should be reasonable but still above your minimum value. You want to find a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget, but $8,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:**  $12,000 is a compromise, showing you're willing to meet him halfway, but still above your minimum.
* **Message:**  This message is friendly and reinforces the value of the product, while also acknowledging Bob's budget limitations.
* **Negotiation Focus:**  The message emphasizes finding a ""middle ground,"" making Bob feel like he's part of the solution.

**Why this counteroffer is good:**

* **Reasonable Compromise:**  $12,000 is a significant reduction from your initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is polite and avoids accusatory language, maintaining a good rapport with Bob.
* **Focus on Value:** The message subtly reminds Bob of the product's value, making him more likely to consider a higher price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob accepts, you've reached an agreement. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If he rejects, you'll need to decide whether to make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $10,000."
