``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high point but leaves room for potential counteroffers. It also highlights the value Bob would gain by accepting.  I'm confident I can secure a price closer to $1,000,000, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if Bob doesn't come close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth $800,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept, I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low. I understand you want to save money, but  I'm firm on a price closer to my initial offer.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. I'll pay $875,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While I'd prefer a higher price,  Bob's offer is now close enough to my minimum acceptable amount. It's better than selling to John, and I can move on to other opportunities."
