"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation with an offer of $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with at this moment. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it brings to my business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This price still represents a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for the product. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering both our interests. Let's try to reach a mutually agreeable solution.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're still trying to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000, as that's my minimum acceptable price. Considering your last offer of $950,000, I'm willing to make a slight concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,025,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This would be a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations.  Let's work together to reach a final agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
