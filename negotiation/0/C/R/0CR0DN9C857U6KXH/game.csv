"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price and allows you to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product and the negotiations we've had so far. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to counter back.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though.  How about $1,150,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset while still ensuring I get a price that reflects the product's worth. ",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit higher than my initial target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a good price for the product while I save some money. Let me know if you're willing to accept this offer or if you'd like to counter back.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
