"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it. Can you consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $9000.  This product is truly unique, and I believe you'll find it very valuable. Let's find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $9000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. Can you consider that?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $7500 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8500.  This is a fair price, and I believe you'll be very satisfied with the product. Let's finalize this deal!",8500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $8500. I'm willing to pay $7800 for the product. Can you consider that?",7800.0,Bob,6,
