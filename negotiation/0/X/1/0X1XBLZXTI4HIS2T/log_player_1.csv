"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000. This is an aggressive opening, but it establishes a high baseline and leaves room for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm aiming to maximize my potential profit. If Bob rejects this offer, we can then adjust the price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'll reject and see if I can push Bob closer to my ideal price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still keeps the price above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping that Bob is close to agreeing and will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has come up to $920,000. This is a good deal, as it's above my minimum value of $800,000. There's a risk that further negotiation might get me a higher price, but it's also possible that I could end up losing value or that the deal could fall apart entirely.  It's better to secure a good profit now rather than risk missing out."
