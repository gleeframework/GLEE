"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is no less than $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering the product at that price. While it seems like a good deal, there's no harm in trying to negotiate a lower price. You have nothing to lose by rejecting the offer and seeing if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the information about the product's value.  While I'm interested, I'm hoping to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into acquiring it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved from $12,000 to $11,000, which is a $1,000 discount. You're still within your budget, and it's a good price considering you don't know the true value of the product to Alice. There's no guarantee you'll get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  It's a reasonable price, and you're likely to save more money than if you bought it from John."
