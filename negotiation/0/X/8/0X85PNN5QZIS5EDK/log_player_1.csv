Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (Your value from John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Potential Profit Zone:** $200,000 (The difference between Bob's value and your minimum)

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that is:

* **Higher than your minimum:**  This ensures you get more than John's offer.
* **Lower than Bob's value:** This makes it attractive for Bob to accept.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I move forward with other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**
    * Creates a sense of exclusivity and urgency.
    * Highlights the product's value.
    * Mentions other potential buyers (without being too aggressive).
* **Price:**
    *  This price allows you to capture a significant portion ($150,000) of the potential profit zone while still leaving Bob with a gain ($50,000) compared to his perceived value.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point (John's offer) is crucial.
* **Relationship:**  Consider if a long-term business relationship with Bob is important. You might be willing to accept a slightly lower price for that benefit."
