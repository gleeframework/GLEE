Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on a product I think you'll love. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $120 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down a little, while still keeping us well above our minimum price.
* **Confident but Not Greedy:** The message aims to be persuasive by highlighting the product's value to Bob, but avoids appearing overly aggressive or greedy. 

By setting the initial price at $120, we increase the chances of Bob accepting and us securing a significant profit, while having John as a backup ensures we don't lose out completely."
