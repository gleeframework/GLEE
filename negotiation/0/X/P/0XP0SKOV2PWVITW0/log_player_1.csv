Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $12,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but also leaves room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to encourage him to accept a higher price. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** I'm not going straight for the highest possible price. This allows for a back-and-forth and potentially leads to a better outcome for both of us.

This strategy balances my desire for a high price with the need to remain open to negotiation and avoid losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to him. There's still room to negotiate.
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  I can always sell to John for $8,000, so I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer right away.
* **Negotiation opportunity:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a higher price.

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while keeping my goal of maximizing my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. Let's meet halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway (sort of):** My counteroffer is exactly halfway between my previous offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows willingness to compromise while still holding onto a decent profit margin.
* **Positive language:** I use positive language like ""great deal"" to highlight the value Bob will receive, encouraging him to accept.
* **Maintaining a profit:** $10,500 is still well above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.

This counteroffer should be attractive to Bob while also protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,500 is only $500 below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  
* **Limited upside:**  There's not much room for further negotiation, and it's unlikely Bob will go higher. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:**  If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, and I'd be left with selling to John for a lower price.

While $9,500 isn't ideal, it's a reasonable outcome considering the circumstances.  Accepting Bob's offer secures the sale and ensures a profit, which is more important than pushing for a higher price and risking a lost deal."
