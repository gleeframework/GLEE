"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $85.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

``` 

You're willing to pay up to $80, and Alice is offering it for $85. Since John is selling it for your maximum price, it's better to reject Alice's offer."
