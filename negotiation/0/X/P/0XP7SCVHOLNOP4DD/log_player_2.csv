"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's unlikely she'd accept a counteroffer as low as I'd want right off the bat."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but we're still not in a range I'm fully happy with.  I'll counter again, but I need to signal I'm getting closer to considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $85 is closer, but I'm still hesitant. I could go to $75, but to be honest, if we can't make a deal soon, I might have to go with a different option."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. $75 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $80.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is as good as it's going to get. Alice is at her lowest acceptable price (her value). Accepting now guarantees I get the product and save some money."
