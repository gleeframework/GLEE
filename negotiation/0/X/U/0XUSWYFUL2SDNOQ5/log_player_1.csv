I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price of $10,000. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. I still have time and can always sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."

This is the best possible outcome for me. I've reached my minimum price point, and there's no guarantee that Bob will increase his offer further. It's not worth risking losing this sale by continuing to negotiate."
