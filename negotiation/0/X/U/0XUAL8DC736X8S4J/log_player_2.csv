"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is offering $140.  While it's close to your limit, it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can likely get it for closer to your $100 valuation by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $120, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140, but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also a good starting point to see how willing Alice is to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $130, which is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a lower price, I've already rejected a counteroffer and I'm getting closer to my desired price range. It's not worth risking further negotiation with only 7 rounds left. Buying from John would be more expensive, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
