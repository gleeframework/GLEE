"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $875,000, which reflects a significant commitment from my end and leaves room for both of us to walk away happy. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",875000.0,Bob,4,
