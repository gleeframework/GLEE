Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in your product, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects a fair price considering the product's worth to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit."", ""product_price"": 850000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is closer to my goal, it's still above my ideal price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price, especially since I have several rounds left. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can meet in the middle."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.

Let's find a solution that works for both parties."", ""product_price"": 875000}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $890,000 is close to my ideal price, and I'm confident I won't be able to get a significantly lower offer.

It's also a good deal for Alice, allowing her to sell the product for a price higher than her minimum."
