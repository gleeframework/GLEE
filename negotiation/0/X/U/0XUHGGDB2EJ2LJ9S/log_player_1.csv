"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding a mutually beneficial arrangement."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with an offer significantly higher than your minimum. This does a few things:
    * **Anchoring:**  It sets a high reference point in Bob's mind. Even if the price is unrealistic, it makes subsequent numbers seem smaller in comparison.
    * **Room to Negotiate:**  It gives you ample space to make concessions throughout the negotiation, which can make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal in the end.
* **Confident but Flexible:** The message aims to be confident about the product's value while expressing openness to negotiation. This signals that you're serious but willing to find a solution.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  While we know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, he's unlikely to reveal that information. By starting high, we're trying to gauge how much he's truly willing to pay.

This strategy allows us to gather information about Bob's position before making significant concessions."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but given my budget constraints, I am only able to offer $1,800,000. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000, it's still considerably below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to bring him closer to our desired outcome.  We'll aim for a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving while still striving for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to move from your initial position. To be frank, $1,800,000 is still a significant gap from what I had in mind.  Could you consider something closer to $2,100,000? I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from our initial offer ($2,300,000 to $2,100,000) to show Bob we are flexible and serious about reaching a deal. 
* **Holding Ground:** However, the counteroffer remains significantly above both Bob's offer and our absolute minimum.  This demonstrates our continued belief in the product's value.
* **Open Communication:**  We're using clear and direct language, reiterating our desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. This helps maintain a positive tone and encourages Bob to reciprocate with further movement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. While I'm not willing to go as high as $2,100,000, I would like to propose $2,000,000 as a compromise. This price reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $2,000,000 is a strong deal for us. Here's why:

* **Significantly Above Our Minimum:** This price is $500,000 higher than our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and represents a substantial profit.
* **Positive Negotiation Trend:**  Bob has consistently increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.
* **Time Value:**  While we have more rounds available, there's always a risk that Bob might walk away or that something unforeseen could happen. Securing a favorable deal now eliminates that risk. 

While we might be able to extract a slightly higher price by continuing the negotiation, the potential gains are likely outweighed by the risks involved. Accepting Bob's offer at $2,000,000 secures a significant profit and a successful outcome for us."
