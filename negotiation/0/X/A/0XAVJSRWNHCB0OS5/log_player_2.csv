"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is still significantly higher than your walk-away price and what John offers. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than your target price. This leaves room for negotiation and helps you gauge Alice's willingness to move on the price. 
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is respectful of Alice's offer but clearly states your position. 
* **Target in Mind:** Remember, your goal is to get the product for as close to your $12,000 walk-away price as possible, but starting much lower gives you more bargaining power."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This price still allows me to make a fair profit, while giving you a good deal.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your walk-away price of $12,000. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as you won't get a better deal."
