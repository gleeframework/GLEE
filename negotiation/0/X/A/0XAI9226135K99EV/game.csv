"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $18,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'm placing on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $13,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $16,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise that still reflects its worth to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $14,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I hope we can reach an agreement. ",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a significant compromise for you, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to offer a counteroffer of $15,500 for the product. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I place on it, and I hope you'll consider it.",15500.0,Alice,5,
