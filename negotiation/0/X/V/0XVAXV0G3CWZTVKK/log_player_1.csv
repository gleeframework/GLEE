Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a suitable offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000
* **Potential Profit Margin:** $500,000 

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the offer.  Offering a price closer to $1,000,000 increases the chance of Bob rejecting it. 

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a chance to acquire an asset worth significantly more to you, at a price that reflects its exclusivity."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Fair:**  The offer of $1,350,000 leaves Bob with a $150,000 gain, a significant incentive to accept.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" justifies the premium price.
* **Confidence:**  You don't want to appear desperate, so avoid mentioning your deal with John.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is dynamic. Bob might counter-offer. Be prepared to adjust within the range that keeps you above your $1,000,000 minimum."
