"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if we can get closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum desired price.  While I'd love to get more, it's a fair deal. Accepting it ensures I don't lose out and ensures the sale."
