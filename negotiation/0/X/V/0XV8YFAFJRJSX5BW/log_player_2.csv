Bob should reject Alice's offer.  It's above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for less.  Rejecting allows him to counter-offer and potentially save more money."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, he can still buy the same product from John for a lower price. Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1150000 is still a bit low. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $1175000. It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy. Let's seal the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

Bob should accept Alice's offer. This is the best deal he can get, considering the following:

* **It's a better price than John's:**  Alice's offer is $25,000 lower than what John is selling the product for.
* **Further negotiations are unlikely to yield a much better price:** It's possible that Alice will reject another counteroffer, and the negotiation could continue indefinitely. There's no guarantee that Bob will be able to get a lower price than $1,175,000.

Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product for a price that's below his initial budget and still saves him money compared to John."
