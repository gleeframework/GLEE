"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above what the product is worth to me. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's closer to my value of the product but still leaves some room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying and will be willing to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.
