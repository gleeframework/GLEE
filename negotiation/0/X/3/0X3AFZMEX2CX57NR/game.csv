"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $15500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $14000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $14800. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. What do you think?",14800.0,Alice,5,
