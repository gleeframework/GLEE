"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,800. I'm confident that's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $7,800 is better than my minimum of $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,800 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,500, but I'm still a bit higher than that. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is just above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation rounds potentially leading to a lower price or a sale to John at a lower price."
