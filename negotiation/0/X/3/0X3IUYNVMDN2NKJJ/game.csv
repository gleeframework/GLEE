"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for the product. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $125. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to pay $105 for the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $105 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise and sell it to you for $115. It's a great opportunity to get this amazing product, and I think you'll really benefit from it.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $115 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and agree on $110?  I'm ready to finalize this deal.",110.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not ready to give up on getting a better price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell it to you for $112.50. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",112.5,Alice,7,
