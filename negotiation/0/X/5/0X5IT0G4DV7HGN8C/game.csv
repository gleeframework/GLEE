"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price. Let's compromise at $10,500. This still represents a significant saving for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. ",10500.0,Alice,3,
