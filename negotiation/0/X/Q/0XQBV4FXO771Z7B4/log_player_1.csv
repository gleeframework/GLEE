Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves some room for profit on your end. Let's make a deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. While it's a step closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $900,000 is a good deal, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob.  It's also significantly more than what John is offering."
