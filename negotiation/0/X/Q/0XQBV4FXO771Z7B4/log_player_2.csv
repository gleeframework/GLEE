"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is a good deal compared to buying from John, it's still significantly higher than the product's worth to her. There's room for negotiation, and I can likely get a lower price."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However,  $850,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This still gives you a significant profit margin and is closer to my desired price point. What do you say?

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in price, which is good. However, $950,000 is still a lot higher than my ideal price. I want to continue negotiating and see if we can reach a price closer to $850,000."
