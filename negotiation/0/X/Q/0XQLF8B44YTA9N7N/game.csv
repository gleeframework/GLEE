"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, the $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the true worth of this product and the value it can bring.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I believe this is a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
