"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay the full asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  You can get the same product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
