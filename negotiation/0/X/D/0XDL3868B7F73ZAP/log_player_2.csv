"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,350,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  It's too high, and there's room for negotiation. He should try to get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value the product at more than $1,100,000, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? This price reflects the value of the product while also being fair to both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He's already shown Alice that he's willing to walk away, so there's still room to push for a better deal.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is always an option, but it's better to see if he can get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,162,500?  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1162500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $1,162,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not quite there. How about $1,187,500? This price is still within a reasonable range and allows us to close this deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,187,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,187,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already pushed the price down significantly from the initial offer, and Alice is clearly not going to go lower.  He can get the product for $1,187,500, which is a good deal compared to buying from John at $1,200,000.  It's a good time to close the deal and avoid further negotiation."
