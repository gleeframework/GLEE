"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $6,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise. While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $7,500? I'm hoping we can make a deal.",7500.0,Bob,4,
