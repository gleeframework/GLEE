{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer to $912,500, it's still too high for my budget. I'm getting closer to a deal, but I can still push for a lower price before considering buying from John. I'll reject the offer and counter with a lower price in the next round."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $905000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer of $915,000 is still above my target price. While I'm getting close to a deal, it's risky to keep pushing as I might miss out on the product entirely. Considering I only have one round left, it's wiser to purchase the product from John for $1,200,000 to guarantee I get it.  Although it's a higher price, it's better than potentially losing the opportunity altogether."
