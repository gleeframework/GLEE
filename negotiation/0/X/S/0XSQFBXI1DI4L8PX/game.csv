"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for a product that's worth significantly more to me. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I am willing to pay $10,000 for your product. Let me know if this works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $11,000 to make this worthwhile. Let me know if you're interested in that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am still interested in purchasing your product and would like to propose a price of $10,500. Please let me know if this is something we can work with.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in my product.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but $10,500 is still not enough for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,750?  That's a fair price for both of us.",10750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my offer. I am willing to pay $10,600 for your product. This is the highest amount I can afford, given my budget constraints. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",10600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still unable to accept $10,600.  How about we compromise at $10,800?  This is a good price for both of us and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",10800.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your efforts to accommodate my budget. However, I am unable to increase my offer beyond $10,600. I hope this proposal is within your acceptable range.",10600.0,Bob,8,
