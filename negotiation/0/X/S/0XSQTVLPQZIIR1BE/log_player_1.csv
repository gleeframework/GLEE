"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  By opening at $2,300,000, we signal that we value the product highly. While this is significantly above both Bob's valuation and John's offer, it leaves room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""mutually beneficial agreement"" clearly signals our willingness to negotiate. 

This strategy sets the stage for us to potentially secure a price well above Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, while keeping John's $1,500,000 offer as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not *that* good. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and our starting offer.  Accepting this would be a substantial loss. While we want to negotiate, we also want to signal that we're serious about the product's value. We'll use the next round to bring the price closer to a more reasonable range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my best offer for now.  It's a significant discount and a deal you won't find elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Reduction:**  We've lowered our price by $400,000, showing flexibility. However, we're still significantly above both Bob's offer and our safety net of John's $1,500,000.
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing the ""true value"" and framing the reduction as a significant concession on our part. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Subtle):**  By saying ""my best offer *for now*,"" we imply that this offer might not be on the table indefinitely, subtly encouraging Bob to act sooner.

We're aiming to create a sense of progress in the negotiation while keeping the price anchored well above Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer but still have a ways to go.  $1,900,000 is just not feasible for me. I could maybe stretch my budget to $1,100,000 if that would get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer has increased, but it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We're making progress, but we need to keep pushing towards a more favorable outcome. We'll use the next round to nudge him closer to our target while keeping John's offer in mind as a potential alternative if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,650,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're dropping our price by a substantial $250,000, signaling flexibility and a desire to close the deal.
* **Above the Minimum:**  Importantly, the offer is still $150,000 above our minimum acceptable price (John's offer).
* **Framing the Offer:**  We're emphasizing our compromise and presenting the offer as a win-win, encouraging Bob to accept.
* **Time Pressure (Implicit):**  With each round, we're getting closer to the end of the negotiation, which creates a subtle sense of urgency. 

This offer aims to secure a deal that's significantly better than our backup option while still being potentially acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said,  $1,650,000 is still a bit rich for my blood.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I think that's a very fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're in a delicate stage of the negotiation. While Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting as it's above our absolute minimum, we are still in a position to negotiate further. Accepting at this point would leave potential profit on the table. We need to assess if Bob is willing to go higher. Rejecting keeps the door open for a better deal while still leaving us the option to accept John's offer if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I can tell we're both eager to see this deal go through. How about we settle this right here and now at $1,450,000? It's a small adjustment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):**  We're coming down by $100,000, which is slightly more than half the difference between our previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This signals a willingness to compromise but holds firm on getting a significant return.
* **Finality:** The language ""settle this right here and now"" creates a sense of urgency and suggests this is our final offer.
* **Positive Framing:** We're highlighting the positive aspects of the negotiation and emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome.

This offer aims to close the deal quickly at a price that's still significantly above our safety net while acknowledging Bob's efforts in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a good product, but we're running out of time here.  My absolute final offer is $1,200,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,200,000 falls below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While we've made progress in the negotiation, Bob's ultimatum and mention of John suggest he's not willing to move significantly higher.  

At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending up with a worse deal or no deal at all outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher offer from Bob. John's guaranteed offer of $1,500,000 provides a secure and favorable outcome. 

It's time to exercise our backup option and sell the product to John."
