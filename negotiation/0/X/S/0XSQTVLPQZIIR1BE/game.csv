"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product is good, but not *that* good. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, my initial offer reflected the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, but that's my best offer for now.  It's a significant discount and a deal you won't find elsewhere.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer but still have a ways to go.  $1,900,000 is just not feasible for me. I could maybe stretch my budget to $1,100,000 if that would get this deal done.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a workable figure.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,650,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. That being said,  $1,650,000 is still a bit rich for my blood.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? I think that's a very fair offer.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you've been a pleasure to negotiate with, and I can tell we're both eager to see this deal go through. How about we settle this right here and now at $1,450,000? It's a small adjustment, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us both to walk away happy.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a good product, but we're running out of time here.  My absolute final offer is $1,200,000.  If you can't accept that, I'll have to go with John.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
