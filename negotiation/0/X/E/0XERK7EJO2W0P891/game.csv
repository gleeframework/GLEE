"Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both some room to move. What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear your budget concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This would give you a great deal, and I would be closer to my goal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
