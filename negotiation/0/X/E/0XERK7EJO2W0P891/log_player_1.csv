Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me, and I'm still hopeful we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Let's try $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it gives us both some room to move. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

While I appreciate Bob's offer, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear your budget concerns, but I'm still a bit far from your offer. Let's meet at $1,000,000. This would give you a great deal, and I would be closer to my goal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
