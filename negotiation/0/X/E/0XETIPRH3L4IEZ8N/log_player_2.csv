"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you would really be interested in. It's worth at least $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better price elsewhere. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $150 maximum.
* Alice is offering it for $140, which is still above your maximum value.
* You have a fallback option with John who will sell it for $150.

It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy from John, even though it's slightly more expensive, because you can still stay within your budget."
