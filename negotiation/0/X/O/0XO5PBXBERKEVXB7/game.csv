"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be a valuable asset to you. I'm asking for $20,000 for it. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $17,000 is still a bit too steep for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11,500? I feel that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your patience. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm committed to finding a fair price, I can't go as low as $11,500.  Let's settle at $15,500. This feels like a reasonable compromise.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $15,500 is still a bit beyond my budget.  Could you do $12,500?  I feel this is a fair offer considering it's closer to my initial price range.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. How about we split the difference and call it $14,000? That's me coming down significantly, and I believe it's a very fair offer.",14000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate you coming down.  Would you consider $12,800?  I feel that's a very competitive offer and reflects my absolute limit.",12800.0,Bob,8,
