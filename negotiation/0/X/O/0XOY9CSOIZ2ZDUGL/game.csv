"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the maximum I can afford while still finding it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 represents the high-end of its value range, coming down to $850,000 is a significant gap. Could you consider $1,000,000? This price still reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
