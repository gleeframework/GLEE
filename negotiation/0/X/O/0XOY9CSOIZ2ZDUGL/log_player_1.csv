Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which reflects the maximum I can afford while still finding it a worthwhile investment. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 represents the high-end of its value range, coming down to $850,000 is a significant gap. Could you consider $1,000,000? This price still reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging your interest."", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is the absolute maximum I can offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob has twice reiterated that $850,000 is his absolute maximum.  Continuing to negotiate is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from him. Accepting $850,000 would be a $350,000 loss compared to selling to John.  Therefore, the best course of action is to cut negotiations short and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
