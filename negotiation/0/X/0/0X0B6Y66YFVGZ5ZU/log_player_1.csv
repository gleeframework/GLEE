""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, giving us room to negotiate above our minimum.
* **""Take it or Leave it"" Approach:** By making it a one-time offer, we increase the perceived value and urgency. 

This offer aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving him with a net benefit ($100,000) from the purchase."
