"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. You can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go down to $1,080,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $1,080,000 is within your budget and represents a significant improvement from her initial offer. While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might become less willing to negotiate further, or you might end up in a stalemate. Accepting her offer ensures you get the product at a price you're comfortable with and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
