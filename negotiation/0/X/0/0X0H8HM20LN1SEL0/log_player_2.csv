"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is a decent price, Bob can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. There are 9 rounds left, so Bob has room to try and lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $10,500. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $10500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $11,000 is closer to his target, he still has room to negotiate and get a better deal.  There are 7 rounds left, providing opportunities to continue lowering the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit high. How about $10,750?  That's a fair compromise that I think we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his desired price range but still sees potential for a better deal. He has 5 rounds left to negotiate. He can continue to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $11,000 or even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I appreciate your offer, I'm still hoping to get the price down a bit more. How about $11,100? This is a fair compromise that's closer to where we both want to be."", ""product_price"": 11100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the price down, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $11200. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $11150. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Alice's offer of $11,150 is very close to Bob's desired price range. It's only $150 more than his last counteroffer, which indicates that they're close to an agreement.
* **Time Constraint:** With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching a deal with Alice increases.  
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer of $12,000 is still an option, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $850. 

By accepting, Bob secures the product at a price that is within his budget and significantly lower than John's offer."
