"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm going to start with my absolute maximum budget of $8,000. This will establish a strong baseline and see if Alice is willing to negotiate significantly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is still above my budget, but she is getting closer.  There's no reason to jump at this offer, as I believe I can get the price down further with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $9,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price. It's a compromise, but it's still within my budget, and hopefully, it's closer to what Alice is willing to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. There are only 5 rounds left, and it's still worth trying to push for a lower price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target with another counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer again, but only by a small amount. I'm trying to signal to Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm not willing to go much higher. With only a few rounds left, I want to see if we can reach a compromise quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,250 is getting closer to my budget, I'm still not willing to pay that much. We're down to the final rounds, and I'm confident I can get a better deal if I keep pushing. It's worth trying to get closer to my desired price before considering the fallback option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $9,750, which is still within my budget and represents a significant compromise from my previous offer.  With only two rounds left, I want to see if Alice will accept a price that's closer to what I'm willing to pay. If she rejects this offer, I'll be forced to consider buying from John in the final round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round left and Alice still significantly above my desired price point, it's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed price from John.  While I'd prefer to get the product for less, I'm running out of time and bargaining power. Buying from John ensures I get the product within my budget."
