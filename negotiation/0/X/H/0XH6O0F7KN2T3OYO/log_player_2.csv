"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price. Given its value to you, we believe it's worth every penny. We're offering it to you for $100, which is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you is $120. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is less than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially come back with a lower price, getting you a better deal."
