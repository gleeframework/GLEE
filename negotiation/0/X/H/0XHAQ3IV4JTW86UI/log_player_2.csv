"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob, so Alice's initial offer is too high.  It makes sense to reject and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
``` 

Bob is starting with a significant discount, trying to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. He's offering a price that's significantly below his maximum, but still potentially attractive to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice has come down to Bob's maximum price.  Accepting is the best option as this is the best possible deal for Bob and it ensures he doesn't run the risk of losing out on the product or wasting more time negotiating."
