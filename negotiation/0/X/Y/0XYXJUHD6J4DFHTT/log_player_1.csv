Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $15000 for it. Would you consider accepting this lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Since Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's best to accept it and avoid further negotiation.  Any counteroffers might lead to a stalemate, and you risk losing the sale to Bob entirely. Selling to John is also an option, but it guarantees the same price as Bob's offer, and there's a chance Bob might change his mind if you reject him."
