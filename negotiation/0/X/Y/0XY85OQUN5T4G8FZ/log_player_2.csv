"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good price, Bob can still save money by negotiating further.  He can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $10,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's initial offer of $12,000. This price is still within Bob's budget and leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,500 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than his initial budget and leaves room for a decent profit.  While there is a possibility that Bob could negotiate further and get an even lower price, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $15,000 is not worth it.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without risking a higher cost."
