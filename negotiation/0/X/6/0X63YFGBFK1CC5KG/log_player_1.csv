"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit margin. I know it's unlikely Bob will accept this right away, but it sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me room to maneuver."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and continue the negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still leaves me with a profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."

While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can push for a better price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to close the gap further."

{""product_price"": 1600000}
