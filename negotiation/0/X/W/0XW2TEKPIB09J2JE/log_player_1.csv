Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I think it's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, she should aim for a price higher than that with Bob.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering the product slightly below John's price ($11,999) creates the illusion of a bargain for Bob. While it's a high price, it leaves a small window for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Psychology:** The specific price of $11,999 is a common psychological pricing tactic. It feels significantly cheaper than $12,000, potentially making Bob more receptive.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, Alice is securing her minimum profit of $12,000 from John if this happens."
