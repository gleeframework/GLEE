"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $90 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between $90 and $120. How about $100? It's a good middle ground that I think we can both agree on.",100.0,Alice,3,
