"Thank you for your initial offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $900,000 undervalues the true worth of this product and the benefits it can bring you. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,000,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise and offer $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm confident this product will yield significant returns for you. Let's settle at $975,000 and close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
