Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. Given my budget,  I'm  willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and hopefully gives you some room to negotiate. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the product's worth while still offering you substantial benefit."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,300,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm firm on $900,000. This is a fair price given the value I see in the product, and it gives us both a chance to close this deal. Let's try to find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of him not reaching our desired price within the remaining rounds. Selling to John guarantees us our minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
