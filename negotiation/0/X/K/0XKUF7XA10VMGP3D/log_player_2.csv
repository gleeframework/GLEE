"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its high value to us, let's start with an offer of $10000. We're confident it's within your budget and would significantly enhance your operations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is within his budget, it's not the best possible price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your feedback. To better align with your budget, I propose a counteroffer of $9500 for the product. This still allows us to cover our costs while making the product more accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,500, which is within Bob's budget and closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,000.  While he could continue negotiating, accepting the offer saves him time and ensures he gets the product without having to go to John.  It's a good compromise that allows both parties to benefit."
