"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  Given its value, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Aim high to establish a strong position. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to both parties, there's room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence can influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Open to Agreement:**  The message implies a willingness to negotiate while still emphasizing mutual benefit. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,500,000 is simply too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  While selling to John is an option, I still believe I can negotiate a better deal with Bob. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for a price this low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I must admit it's a bit lower than I envisioned. This product truly is exceptional and holds immense value. How about we meet halfway? I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob's Offer:**  Start by acknowledging Bob's offer to show you're taking his perspective into account.
* **Reiterating Value:**  Subtly remind Bob of the product's high value without being overly aggressive.
* **Compromise (Meeting Halfway):**  A significant reduction from the initial price demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but still holds firm to a price above my minimum.
* **Strong Counteroffer:** $1,200,000 allows for further negotiation while remaining a desirable outcome for me.

This counteroffer aims to bring Bob closer to my target while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your product has value, but $1,200,000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree, I'll have to look elsewhere. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $1,000,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay.  While I might have been able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees I make my minimum desired profit."
