"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth $175. Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150) to leave room for negotiation.  
* **Message:**  A friendly and direct message sets the tone and establishes my desired price.

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I can potentially maximize my profit. However, I'm aware of the risk that Bob might reject this offer. I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit too steep for me, though. How about $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. It's not worth it to sell at that price.  I'm also confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price range. I'm not yet willing to sell to John for $150, as I'm hopeful I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $130, significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility while still being within my acceptable range.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while also stating my own price point and emphasizing the need for compromise.

**Strategy:**

I'm trying to find a middle ground to bridge the gap between our desired prices. This counteroffer shows that I'm willing to negotiate and makes Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's a good product, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $105 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm not desperate to sell and believe I can still get a better price.

**Strategy:**

I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to $130. I'm still confident that I can negotiate a better price and avoid selling to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? I'm confident this price will give you great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer is $120, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $130 and Bob's offer of $105.  This shows that I am willing to meet him halfway. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and reaffirm my belief in the product's value. I'm also using positive language to emphasize the benefits of accepting this price. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move to keep the negotiation moving towards a potential deal. By meeting Bob halfway, I hope to convince him that it's in his best interest to close the deal. I still have a few rounds left to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I need to stick to my budget.  My absolute highest is $100. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I've been willing to negotiate but have reached a point where it's no longer worth it to continue.

**Strategy:**

It's better for me to sell the product to John for $150 than to accept Bob's low offer. This ensures that I meet my minimum price requirement and avoid losing money on the deal."
