"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,200,000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle at $1,700,000? This recognizes the product's true value while offering you a significant discount from my initial proposal. ",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still feel that $1,700,000 is a bit high for me. I would like to propose $1,500,000 as a counteroffer. I believe this price reflects the product's value while staying within my budget. I hope this suggestion is acceptable to you.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
