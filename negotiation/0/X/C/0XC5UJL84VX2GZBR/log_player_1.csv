Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  How about we split the difference and call it a deal at $1,425,000?

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting Bob's offer at $1,425,000 is a strong outcome. It surpasses my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiations."
