"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to sell it for, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
