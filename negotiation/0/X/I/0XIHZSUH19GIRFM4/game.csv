"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",95.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,85.0
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",92.5,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,
"Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a common ground.  How about $93.50?  That's a small step closer to your offer, and we're almost there. What do you think?",93.5,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $93.50. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",92.0,Bob,6,,
