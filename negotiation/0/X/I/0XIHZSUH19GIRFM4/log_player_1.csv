"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Confidence:** Expressing confidence in the value of the product to Bob can subtly influence him. 
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  The message shows I'm open to discussion, making Bob more likely to counteroffer.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or sell to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. 
* **Potential for Better Outcome:**  I believe there's room for further negotiation.  I'm willing to try and get closer to my minimum by counter-offering.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John for $100 is a guaranteed deal, but I'm not willing to accept a loss at this stage.

**Next Steps:** I will counter-offer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a middle ground price, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Fairness:**  Framing $95 as a ""fair compromise"" can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This price is still above my minimum of $100, ensuring I don't lose money. 

**Next Steps:** I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer. If he rejects it, I'll have to re-evaluate and decide whether to lower my price further or move on to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $92.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum of $100, I'm still not willing to settle for a price that's less than $95. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I believe there's still room to negotiate a slightly higher price. 
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Selling to John is always an option, but I'm not desperate to sell at a loss.

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with $93.50, which is a small step closer to his offer. It's a strategic move to test if he's genuinely willing to compromise.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a bit low for me. Let's try to find a common ground.  How about $93.50?  That's a small step closer to your offer, and we're almost there. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 93.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Concession:**  I'm making a small concession by moving my offer closer to Bob's, showing willingness to compromise.
* **""Almost There"" Frame:** I'm emphasizing that we're nearing an agreement to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Strategic Move:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I'm prepared to either move on to John or counteroffer again with $94.  

**Next Steps:**  I'll closely analyze Bob's reaction to this offer. If he still rejects it, I'll weigh my options and decide whether to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $93.50. I'm willing to meet you at $92, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $92 is only $2 away from my minimum acceptable price of $90.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it's unlikely that I can get much more from Bob.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  While selling to John is a safe option, there's a risk that Bob might change his mind if I reject his offer.  

**Next Steps:** Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale and ensures I don't lose money."
