Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $120 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my budget.  Could you do $95? That would make it much easier for me to say yes."",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

It's time to cut our losses.  Alice seems unlikely to go much lower than $110. Buying from John for $100 gets us the product at the best possible price."
