"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  I'm asking for $18,000 to start negotiations. I know it's a significant investment, but I believe the value it brings will be well worth it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering, but $12,000 is too low for what this product offers.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, so I'm offering $13,500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I understand your budget constraints, but the value of this product is undeniable.  Let's settle at $14,250. This is my final offer, as I need to make a decision soon.",14250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but $14,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $13,500, so I'm offering $13,750. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm getting close to considering John's offer, though.",13750.0,Bob,6,
