"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to start by rejecting Alice's offer. There's no information about the product's value to Alice, so there's a chance she might be willing to accept a lower price.  By rejecting, you open the door for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.  This price reflects my current budget and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $1,500,000 to $1,350,000. This is a significant reduction and brings the price closer to your initial counteroffer of $1,200,000.  While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice might not budge further. Buying from John would cost you $1,500,000, making Alice's offer the better deal. Accepting her offer allows you to secure the product at a reasonable price and avoid potentially further negotiations that might not lead to a better outcome."
