"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1200000.  This price reflects my current budget and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1350000. This price still reflects the product's value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach an agreement. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
