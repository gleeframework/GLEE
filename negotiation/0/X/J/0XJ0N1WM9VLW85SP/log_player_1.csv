Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1200000.  This price reflects my current budget and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
