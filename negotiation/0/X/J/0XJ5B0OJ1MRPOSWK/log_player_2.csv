"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to start with an offer of $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You're willing to spend up to $120, but Alice's offer is too high. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $108? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $108 is within your budget and a better deal than buying from John. It's a good compromise, so accepting the offer is the best choice in this round."
