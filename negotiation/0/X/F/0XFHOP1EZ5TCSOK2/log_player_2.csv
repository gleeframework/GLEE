"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product, and John is selling it at that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice. Buying from John is the most efficient way to get the product."
