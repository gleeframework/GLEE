"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $750000, which reflects the product's value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I believe the product's value is higher than that. Considering your willingness to pay $750000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, $825000 is still a bit steep for me.  I believe a price of $800000 reflects the fair market value of the product given its worth to both of us.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're close to your target price, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the potential benefits it can bring to you. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I get a good return on my investment. Let's try to find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a good return, but $850000 is still above my desired price point. I'm willing to go to $825000. This shows a genuine effort to compromise, and it's a price that would be beneficial to both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both parties.",825000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $825000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $825000. I'll counteroffer at $837500. This price still reflects the product's value to me, but it's a fair compromise considering your efforts to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",837500.0,Alice,7,
