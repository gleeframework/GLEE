Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit beyond my minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a strong offer, giving Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for me. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By mentioning listing it publicly, I create a sense of urgency and make the offer feel exclusive, potentially swaying Bob."
