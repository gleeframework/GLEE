"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but is lower than your minimum acceptable price. This allows for room to negotiate, and hopefully encourages Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I think it's a great product and I'd love to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and even lower than my initial offer. It's not in my best interest to accept this offer. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I appreciate his interest, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is still too far from my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $10,000.  This is a fair price for a high-quality product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to spend $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss and will continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $9,500 simply won't work for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product.  This way, we both get a good deal, and I can ensure you're getting a high-quality item."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I've already been negotiating for several rounds and have lowered my price significantly. While I'd rather sell to Bob, I'm not willing to accept such a low offer. It's better to sell to John and secure the full $15,000."
