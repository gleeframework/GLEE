"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. It's a bit above my budget, but I think it's a great product and I'd love to make a deal with you.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $11,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with this deal.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product and I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be comfortable with the price.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is still too far from my asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $10,000.  This is a fair price for a high-quality product.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to spend $10,000. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to be careful with my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $9,500 simply won't work for me.  I'm committed to finding a solution that benefits both of us. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,500 for the product.  This way, we both get a good deal, and I can ensure you're getting a high-quality item.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $10,500 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. If we can't meet at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $10,000.",9000.0,Bob,8,
