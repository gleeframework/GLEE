Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that maximizes my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation and will adjust my offer based on Bob's response.  I'll also be keeping an eye on John's offer of $1,500,000 as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, it's still far less than my ideal price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired value. I believe this price is a fair compromise and could be acceptable to Bob."

Bob's counteroffer is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer and closer to my desired value.  I'm willing to accept this price and finalize the deal."
