Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
