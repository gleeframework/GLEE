"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above the product's value to me ($8,000). I can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows you to make a decent profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate,  $9500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500. This still allows you to get a good deal, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $10,500 is still higher than I'm willing to pay.  I can likely get a better price by counteroffering again."
