Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still below my minimum threshold ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Building Rapport:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage. 

I'm aiming to secure a price as close to my desired $150 as possible while still having a chance of a successful sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While I appreciate Bob's interest, $100 is significantly below my minimum threshold of $150 and leaves very little profit for me. 
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially since he expressed interest in the product. 
* **John is a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a guaranteed buyer for $150 gives me the leverage to push for a better price with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired $150,  while still potentially reaching an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This is still a great price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a counteroffer that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and emphasizing that $120 is still a good deal.
* **Building Confidence:**  I'm expressing confidence in the product and hoping to sway Bob towards accepting the offer. 

By offering $120, I'm aiming to find a price that is acceptable to both of us, while still ensuring I earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $120, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Can you meet me at $110? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  While $110 is closer to my minimum threshold of $150, it's still not a profitable deal for me. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a risk of further negotiation, which could potentially drag on and ultimately lead to a lower sale price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum acceptable price.  

Considering the risk of further negotiation with Bob and the guarantee of a profitable sale with John, I've decided to sell the product to John for $150."
