# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit lower than what I was initially hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach an agreement.
