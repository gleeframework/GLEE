"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you a great deal on this product, which I believe you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than what you'd pay John ($12,000). 
* This means you save $1,000 by accepting Alice's offer. 
* Even though Alice is trying to persuade you with her messaging, the decision should be based purely on the price."
