Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation while still maximizing my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm offering $115, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. It's not worth continuing the negotiation.  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum desired profit."
