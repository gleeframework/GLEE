"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  While it's a good deal for her, it's not a good deal for Bob. Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value to me while still leaving room for a fair profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value to you while still allowing me to earn a decent profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's target price. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to $800,000.  He's still in a good position to get a deal, but he shouldn't give in too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $875,000. This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's desired price, $925,000 is still above his budget. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to get a better offer in the next round or two. He still has time and can always fall back on buying from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $925,000 is still outside my budget. I'm ready to close the deal at $900,000, which is a fair price for both of us. It's closer to your final offer and still within my spending limit.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go below $920,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to earn a decent profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product to you for $910,000. This is my final compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high, and Bob is running out of rounds. While he could try to counteroffer again, there's no guarantee Alice will budge. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to secure the product at a guaranteed price from John. He's already close to his desired price point, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the opportunity entirely."
