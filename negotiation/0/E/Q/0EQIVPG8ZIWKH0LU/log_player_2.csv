"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You're trying to save money and Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  You know you can get the product from John for the same price, so rejecting Alice's offer means you'll likely get a better deal later. There's no reason to accept her offer at this point."
