"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $700,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that $760,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to find a middle ground. I'll offer the product to you for $795,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $800,000. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
