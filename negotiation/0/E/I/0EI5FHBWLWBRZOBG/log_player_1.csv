Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95.  It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than Bob's perceived value, which might encourage him to accept. However, it's still above my minimum acceptable price of $80, ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to pay $90 for the product? That would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about $87 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $87 is close to my minimum acceptable price and  I'm happy to accept it.  I'd rather sell to Bob than to John for a slightly lower price."
