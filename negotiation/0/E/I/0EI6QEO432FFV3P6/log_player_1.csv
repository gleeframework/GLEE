{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair and reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, aiming higher with Bob allows us to potentially earn an additional $350,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  The price of $1,350,000 is carefully chosen:
    * It's significantly lower than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000), making it an attractive deal.
    * It's considerably higher than John's offer, ensuring a substantial profit even if Bob declines.
* **Confident Messaging:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" adds appeal and justifies the high price. 

**Important Note:** This is a strong opening offer. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation tactics, we might slightly adjust the price downward if needed. However, we always want to stay above the $1,000,000 safety net John provides."
