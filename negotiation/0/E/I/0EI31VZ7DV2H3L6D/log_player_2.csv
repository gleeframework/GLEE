"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $11,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice is offering $11,000. 
* This is a good deal for you, but you can potentially get it for less. 
* Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has moved closer to your desired price.
* You can buy the product for $10,500, which is still a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000.
*  There's a chance Alice might not budge further, so accepting this offer is a good strategy to avoid missing out on a good deal."
