Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a little higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a higher price. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to Bob in my message, hoping to make the deal more appealing."
