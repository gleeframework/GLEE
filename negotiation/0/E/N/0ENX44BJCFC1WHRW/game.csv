"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great price for such a valuable product.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to buy the product.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $11,250. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
