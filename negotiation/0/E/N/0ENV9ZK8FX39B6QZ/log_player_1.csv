{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation while still being above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see value in the product and be willing to pay something closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's better than selling to John for the same price.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, so I'll take this deal."
