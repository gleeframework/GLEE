"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering current market conditions.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the market,  I believe $900,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product offers.

"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still aiming for something a little lower. Would you consider $950,000? I believe that's a very competitive offer and represents a fair deal for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
