"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a decent profit while recognizing your interest in the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
