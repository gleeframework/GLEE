Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is significantly lower than both my valuation and John's standing offer. It makes no sense to accept it. I'll counter, but I'll stay firm to signal the product's value.
