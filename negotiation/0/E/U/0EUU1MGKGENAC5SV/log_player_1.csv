"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly.
* **Not Too High:** While starting high, we don't want to alienate Bob with an unrealistic price. $22,000 is a significant markup from his perceived value, but might be justifiable depending on the product's nature.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential benefits, aiming to influence Bob's perception of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Difference:** Bob's offer of $10,000 is considerably lower than our minimum of $15,000. Accepting would mean a substantial loss.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's a large gap between our initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, suggesting room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Option:** We have the security of John's offer at $15,000, so we're not desperate to accept a low price.

By rejecting Bob's offer, we signal that we're serious about the negotiation but open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $19,000.  This is a serious offer reflecting the product's worth."", ""product_price"": 19000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** We lowered our price from $22,000 to $19,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Still Above Minimum:** The new price remains comfortably above our $15,000 minimum and John's offer.
* **Justification:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the price, aiming to shift Bob's perception and create a sense of urgency.

We're moving closer to a potential agreement while still protecting our interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I can offer $12,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects our respective needs. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to our $15,000 minimum but still falls short. 
* **Upward Trend:**  Bob has increased his offer, indicating progress and a willingness to pay more than his initial offer.
* **Time for Leverage:** We're not in a rush, and we have John's offer as a safety net.  Rejecting this offer maintains a position of strength and allows us to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay. 

We'll reject this offer to encourage Bob to make another, hopefully closer to our desired range, but we are now getting closer to considering selling to John if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I see we're getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $16,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a very fair deal considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 16500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant move down to $16,500, showing a strong willingness to find a compromise. This might encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer.
* **Close to Minimum:** This price is still slightly above our guaranteed $15,000 from John, but it leaves a small margin for potential further negotiation.
* **Time Constraint:** With half the rounds remaining, creating a sense of urgency becomes more important. We want Bob to understand this is a limited-time offer and a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your effort, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints, I can offer $14,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above our guaranteed $15,000 from John. It's a profit, even if it's less than our initial target.
* **Strong Counteroffer:** This counteroffer suggests Bob is serious and likely close to his maximum price.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation further with only four rounds remaining risks losing Bob altogether.  Accepting now secures the sale.

While we could push for a slightly higher price, the risk of losing the deal outweighs the potential for a small additional gain. Accepting $14,000 represents a good compromise and a profitable outcome."
