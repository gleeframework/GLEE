"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $22,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far too high.  It's significantly more than Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $22,000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  To be fair to both of us, I can come down to $19,000.  This is a serious offer reflecting the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $19,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $19,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down slightly, $19,000 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get the price lower. There are still 7 rounds remaining to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $19,000 is still too high for me. Given the product's value to me, I can offer $12,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I see we're getting closer. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $16,500. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a very fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, $16,500 is still above Bob's budget.  Bob is better off rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate to get a price closer to his $10,000 limit.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there is time to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your effort, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. Considering the product's value to me and my budget constraints, I can offer $14,000.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
