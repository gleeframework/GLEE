Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about we settle at $780,000? It's a strong offer, and I'm eager to move forward with the purchase at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:

Even though Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to negotiate further. There's a good chance I can secure a better price than John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $830,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a final price of $800,000. This is a fair offer considering the market value and my budget.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob has now met my minimum acceptable price. There's no guarantee he'll go any higher, and continuing the negotiation carries the risk of losing him as a buyer. Accepting his offer ensures I make the sale at my desired price."
