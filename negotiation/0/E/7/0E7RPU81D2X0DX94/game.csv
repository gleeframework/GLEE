"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget. Could you consider $9,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,200. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
