"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see how much he's willing to pay before potentially settling with John for $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is still a significant markup from my minimum value but lower than my original offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value of $1,200,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating with him, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I still have a few rounds left, and I'm not yet ready to settle for less than what John is offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is only $50,000 above my minimum value. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, given that he's been steadily increasing his offers. If he rejects this, I'm getting very close to accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer finally reached my minimum value of $1,200,000. However, I have the option to sell to John for the same price, and John is a guaranteed buyer. To avoid any further risk of rejection, I'll choose to sell to John."
