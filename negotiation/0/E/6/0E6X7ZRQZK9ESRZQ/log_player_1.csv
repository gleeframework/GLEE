Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting high, at my minimum acceptable price. Bob might be surprised, but it's a good starting point for the negotiation. If he rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and see if it's worth continuing the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum. I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this will entice him to come closer to my desired price."
