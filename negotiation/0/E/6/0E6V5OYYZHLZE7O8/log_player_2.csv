"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $1,000,000 is less than what John is offering, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and try to lower the price further. 
* **No immediate urgency:**  There's no indication that Bob needs the product immediately, so he has time to negotiate."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets both of our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's ideal price:** $950,000 is closer to Bob's budget, but it's still a significant amount above his preferred price. 
* **Further negotiation is possible:**  Bob can make another counteroffer, potentially bridging the gap between his desired price and Alice's offer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Bob still has the option to buy from John, providing leverage during negotiations with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm thinking $975000 is a more reasonable price for this product. It's a fair compromise that should satisfy both of us.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the gap:** Alice's offer of $975,000 is getting closer to Bob's preferred price range, and it's within his budget. 
* **Limited room for further negotiation:** Another counteroffer might not lead to a significantly lower price. There's a risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.
* **Value for Bob:**  While it's not the ideal price, buying from Alice at $975,000 is still a better deal than paying $1,200,000 to John."
