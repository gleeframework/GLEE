Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I believe this price reflects its worth and potential for a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start negotiations significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The offer of $1,450,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" aims to justify the high price, even though you know it's worth less to Bob directly. 

This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still leaving a slight chance for Bob to accept the offer. If he declines, you'll still secure your minimum desired price from John."
