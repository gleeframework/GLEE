"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice,  $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $800000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $1000000? This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal. ",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1200000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll offer the product to you for $1100000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I'm really trying to make this work, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000, which is a good compromise.  If this isn't acceptable, I may need to go with another seller. ",950000.0,Bob,6,
