"Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point. However, considering the product's value to me and the market price, I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. I'm confident this price is still fair and beneficial for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to sell the product at $1,000,000. Considering its value to you and the market price, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to you, and I believe it's a good compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
