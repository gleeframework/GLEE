Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,700,000.  Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high initial price:** Since the product is worth $1,500,000 to both you (your minimum) and Bob, starting higher leaves room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The message hints at potential flexibility (""discussing this further""). 
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price. 
* **Backup plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while acknowledging Bob's valuation and leaving the door open for a mutually beneficial deal."
