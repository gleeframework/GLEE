"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating with Alice.  Since Bob has a clear alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000, he has leverage in the negotiation.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Considering the potential value to me, I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's initial counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's offer. It's aggressive but still leaves room for further negotiation. Bob is aiming to get as close to his $1,000,000 limit as possible while still showing a willingness to negotiate. This sets a strong foundation for the next round of the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and prove to be a valuable investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than his alternative with John. Bob should continue negotiating, aiming to get a price closer to $1,100,000 or even lower.  There's still room for Alice to move further, and Bob wants to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is closer, I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we settle at $1,150,000?  This would be a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is offering a middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's last offer. He is demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to his target.  This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving towards a potential agreement."
