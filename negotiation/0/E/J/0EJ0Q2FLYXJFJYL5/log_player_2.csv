"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $150, but Alice is asking for $120. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  You can likely get a better price.
* **Going to John is a last resort.**  You'll pay more, so it's better to exhaust negotiations with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer:**  A $20 drop from Alice's price shows you're serious about negotiating and sets a lower starting point.
* **Leave room for compromise:**  You're still well within your budget, and this gives Alice space to meet you halfway. 
* **Don't go too low:**  A drastic drop might make Alice feel you're not taking the deal seriously."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still too high.**  While she lowered her price, she's still asking for more than you want to pay.
* **You're getting closer.** The negotiation is progressing, and you're likely to reach a deal closer to your desired price.
* **You're not desperate yet.**  John is still your backup, but it's better to continue negotiating with Alice for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet Alice halfway:**  Her latest offer was $115, so this counteroffer is a compromise that shows your willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay within your budget:**  $105 is still within your limit of $150. 
* **Show progress:**  By increasing your offer slightly, you demonstrate that you're serious about reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is close to your desired price:** $110 is only $5 above your ideal price of $105. 
* **You've made progress:** You've managed to negotiate down from $120 to $110 in just a few rounds.
* **Time is a factor:**  You're already halfway through your rounds, and continuing to negotiate might risk running out of time and having to buy from John at a higher price.

**This is a calculated risk:** You could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price. However, there's a chance Alice might become stubborn, and you could end up with a worse deal.  At this point, accepting the offer seems like the most reasonable strategy to get the product within your budget."
