{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I understand your perspective on the value, but  $800,000 is quite a ways off from what I can accept.  To be frank, I have another offer lined up, but I believe in giving you a fair shot. How about we meet halfway at $1,500,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and you're already at risk of losing the deal to another buyer. It's best to take the guaranteed deal with John."
