"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment to the terms.

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm sticking to my original proposal of $11500 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given our previous discussions. If you can agree on this price without the additional extras, I'd be happy to proceed.",11500.0,Bob,8,
