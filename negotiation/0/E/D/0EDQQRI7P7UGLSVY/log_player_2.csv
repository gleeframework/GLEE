Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a reasonable price for this valuable asset.
