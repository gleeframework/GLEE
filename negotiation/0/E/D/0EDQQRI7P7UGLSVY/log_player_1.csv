Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's estimated value but still lower than my minimum. This gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and frames the offer as an opportunity.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to discussing the price further.

**Next Steps:**

Depending on Bob's response, I will:

* **If he accepts:** Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If he rejects and makes a counteroffer:** I will analyze his offer and decide if it's close enough to my minimum. If it is, I'll likely accept. If not, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum.
* **If he rejects or we can't agree on a price:** I'll stop negotiating and sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While it's good to see he's interested, I'm not willing to accept such a low price at this point.  

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum. I want to gauge his flexibility and see if we can find a middle ground.  If he continues to be far below my price, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a reasonable price for this valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:**  I show respect for his position and understanding of his budget.
* **Highlight the value:**  I reiterate the importance of the product to remind him it's not just an ordinary item.
* **Counter with a compromise:**  Instead of going back to my initial $900,000, I offer a middle ground at $850,000. This shows willingness to negotiate and increases the chance of reaching an agreement.
* **Frame it positively:** I emphasize the ""good deal"" he'll get if he accepts, making it more appealing.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts this counteroffer, I've secured a good deal. 
* If he rejects, I'll need to assess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or selling to John. If he offers a price closer to $850,000, I may be willing to negotiate further. However, if he continues to offer significantly lower amounts, I'll likely move on and sell to John for the guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $775,000 is an increase from his previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm not willing to risk losing a substantial amount of money just to close the deal.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my minimum. However, I'll be prepared to walk away and sell to John if this final offer is rejected."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $900,000.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this valuable asset, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 837500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm making it clear this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to decide.
* **Focus on Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Compromise:** While I'm not going as low as $775,000, I'm offering a compromise at $837,500, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Urgency:** The message implies a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to make a quick decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good deal.
* **Reject:** If Bob rejects, I'll move on to selling the product to John for $1,000,000.  There's no point in further negotiation if he's not willing to meet me closer to my minimum."
