"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to negotiate.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and understand your budget constraints.  However, $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to work with you, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? This gives you a good deal and still allows me to get a reasonable price for this valuable asset.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $775,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While $775,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there.  To make this work, I'd need to be closer to $900,000.  If you're truly serious about acquiring this valuable asset, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $837,500. This is my final offer. Let me know your decision.",837500.0,Alice,5,
