"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to get the product for as low as possible, and $100 is still above your maximum.  It's worth seeing if you can negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's close to Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  This shows good faith in negotiating while also giving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $95 is within my budget and is getting closer to my desired price.  It's not ideal, but it's a good deal compared to buying from John for $120.  With only 7 rounds left, it's more likely that I won't be able to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
