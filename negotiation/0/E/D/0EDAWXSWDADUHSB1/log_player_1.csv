Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the significant returns you'll see."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I can afford to start high with Bob.
* **Justification for Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" and ""significant returns"" to justify the high price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate down. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my minimum acceptable price."
