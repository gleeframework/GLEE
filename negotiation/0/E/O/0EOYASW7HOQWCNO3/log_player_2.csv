"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to both of us. Let's make this transaction smooth and beneficial for both parties. I suggest we start at $85 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is good, but there's room for negotiation. You want to save as much money as possible and aim for a price closer to your maximum. Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $85 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's start at $75 and see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle? I propose we set the product price at $80. This still gives us a good margin while being reasonable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, you're still aiming to save more. You've already rejected $85, so accepting $80 wouldn't be the most financially beneficial. Rejecting allows you to continue the negotiation process and potentially get the price even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice.  $80 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $75. How about we settle on $77.50?"", ""product_price"": 77.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see your point, Bob. Let's try $79. This price reflects a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $79
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $79 is very close to your ideal price of $75, and it's likely you won't be able to get much lower. You've already rejected several offers, and continuing the negotiation process risks running out of rounds or Alice getting frustrated and sticking to her price. It's a good deal for you at $79, so accepting is the best choice."
