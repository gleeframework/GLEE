Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can't commit to $14000. How about we aim for a price closer to $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can secure a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a great deal for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still not comfortable settling for that. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can secure a price closer to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I believe there is still room for compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This price reflects the value of the product to both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
