Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair offer. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Testing the Waters:**  A significantly higher offer (in this case, 50% above your minimum) helps you gauge Bob's eagerness and potential for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, potentially still landing you a price well above your minimum.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's value, aiming to pique Bob's interest and justify the high price without revealing specific details.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his response. If he outright rejects the price, you can gradually decrease it, using your $1,500,000 safety net from John as leverage."
