"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that could significantly benefit your operations and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a substantial discount considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
