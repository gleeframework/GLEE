Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.
