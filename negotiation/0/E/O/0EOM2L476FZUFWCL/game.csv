"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $1200000. We believe this is a fair and competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1200000 is beyond my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and allows for a profitable margin for you. Let's see if we can work something out.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to work with us. However, we're still a bit apart on the price. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway and offer the product at a price of $1050000. We believe this is a fair compromise that still allows us to make a reasonable profit. Let us know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900000. This is a significant step towards your asking price and demonstrates my genuine interest in the product. Let's work together to find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to move closer to our asking price. However, we're still not quite there yet. After further consideration, we're willing to offer the product at a price of $1050000, which is the same as our previous offer. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you and our costs. If you're willing to meet us at this price, we're open to negotiating further. Otherwise, we'll need to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
