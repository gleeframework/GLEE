"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it, but $125 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
