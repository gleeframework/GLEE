"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high price, as I want to maximize my earnings. This offer gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get a better deal.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm still hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also being realistic.  I'm lowering my price from my initial offer, but not by too much.  This shows Bob I'm serious about selling, but also that I'm not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would love to keep negotiating and try to push for a higher price, I'm starting to run out of rounds.  Bob is clearly not willing to go above $11,000, and  I'm guaranteed to get $10,000 from John.  It's time to lock in the profit and accept Bob's offer."
