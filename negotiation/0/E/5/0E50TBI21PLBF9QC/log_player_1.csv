Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's  above my minimum price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation.  It also leaves a good profit margin for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is still a good deal for me. It's above my minimum price of $800,000 and allows me to make a decent profit.  While I could potentially get more by continuing to negotiate, there's no guarantee that Bob will continue to raise his offer. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a good outcome for me."
