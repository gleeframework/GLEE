"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1300000 is a bit too low for me at this stage. To demonstrate my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to come down to $1375000.  This represents a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would be a great investment for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $1350000. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
