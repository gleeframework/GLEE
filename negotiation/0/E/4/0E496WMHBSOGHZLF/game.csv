"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and leaves me with a comfortable profit. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While $1,300,000 is a fair offer, I need a little more to make this work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is still a great deal for you, and allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a good compromise, and allows us both to get closer to our target prices. What do you think?",1325000.0,Bob,4,
