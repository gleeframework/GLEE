# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1250000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident this price will be mutually beneficial. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a discount from the product's true value to Alice, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  He can get the same product from John for $1,000,000, saving $250,000."
