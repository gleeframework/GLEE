"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer, but $85 is still significantly lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm willing to come down to $100, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to pay $90. This is a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $95.  This is a fair price that would allow both of us to walk away happy. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,5,
