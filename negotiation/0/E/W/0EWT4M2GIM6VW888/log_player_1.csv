"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting high, at $10,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,000 is my minimum, I'm not eager to settle just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more, especially since Bob is willing to offer something close to my minimum.  I'll reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I still think the product is worth more than $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still above my minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer again and try to see if I can get him to budge closer to $8,000. I have a few more rounds to try and close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,500.  I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to meet me halfway. I'm also starting to run out of rounds, so I want to see if I can get a deal done before I have to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. Bob's offer is getting too low, and I'm running out of time.  While I'd prefer to get a bit more than $8,000, John is a guaranteed sale, and I need to ensure I don't lose out on the opportunity to make at least my minimum."
