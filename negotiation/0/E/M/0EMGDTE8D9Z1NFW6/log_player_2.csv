# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $100. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and there is room for negotiation. You should try to get a lower price."

""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! However, $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $85?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92

While closer to your desired price, you can still try to negotiate a bit further down from Alice's $92 offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $88 is still a bit below my target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $90? I think that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:

``` 

Alice is likely not going to budge much from $90, and it's a reasonable price within your budget. It's better to accept the deal now than risk the negotiations breaking down and having to buy from John for $120."
