"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $100 doesn't quite work for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses down. Could we possibly agree on $105 for the product?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To make this work for both of us, I'd need to stick to $112. It's the absolute lowest I can go, but it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let me know if you're able to meet me there.  If not, I'll need to explore other options.",112.0,Alice,5,
