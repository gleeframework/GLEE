Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer.  I'm prepared to offer you the product for $1,050,000.  This still leaves room for you to gain significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a strong return on your investment.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.
