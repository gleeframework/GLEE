"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I can do $11,000, and that's as low as I can go. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with it.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, $10,000 is still a bit short of my target. I can meet you halfway at $12,500, and that's as high as I can go. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close, but that's still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
