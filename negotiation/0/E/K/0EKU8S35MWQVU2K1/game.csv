"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $13,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500.  This is a fair price considering the value we both see in the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
