"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $80 is tempting, it's simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $90, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're willing to come down to $90, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer!  While I appreciate your offer, $85 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's a significant reduction from my original asking price, and it reflects my desire to reach a deal with you. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $95, but I'm still not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $92.50, and that's my final offer. If I don't get it, I'll have to go with John's offer of $80.",92.5,Bob,6,
