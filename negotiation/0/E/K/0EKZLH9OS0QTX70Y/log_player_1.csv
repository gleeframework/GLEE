Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price point. This is a win-win scenario for me if Bob accepts, as it's my minimum acceptable price. If he rejects, I can always sell to John for the same amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $95 is more than I'd get if I sold to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $110. This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's also more appealing to Bob than my previous offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good profit margin for me, and it's closer to my desired price than my previous counteroffer. I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely by continuing to negotiate."
