Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a price closer to my product's true value.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value and fairness, encouraging Bob to consider the offer seriously."
