"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us off on the right foot. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $850,000. How about we try $875,000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great price for this amazing product.",875000.0,Alice,3,
