"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is my final counteroffer, so please let me know if it works for you.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
