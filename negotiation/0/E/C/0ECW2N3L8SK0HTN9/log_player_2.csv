"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good starting point, it's still above my target of saving as much money as possible.  There are still rounds available to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $1,400,000, it's still not within my target range.  I believe I can still negotiate a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This would allow us to reach a deal that's fair to both of us and would bring us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.
