"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to own a truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below what I consider its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects a willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the product's worth.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,250,000.  This would allow us to reach a deal that's fair to both of us and would bring us closer to a final agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but I need to be firm on the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,275,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,275,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,262,500.  I'm confident this would be a mutually beneficial deal, allowing you to make a good sale and me to get a great product within my budget.",1262500.0,Bob,6,
