,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I value your interest, that price undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000. This represents a significant discount from my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a fair agreement.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $1,850,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,700,000. I believe this price reflects the product's value to me and is a reasonable compromise.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Let's find a way to close this deal. How about we settle at $1,775,000?  This represents a significant compromise on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done.",1775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,725,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
