"Hi Alice, thanks for offering! $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $65 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, Alice. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer.  $75 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  Would you be willing to go to $80?  That's a fair price for both of us and would let us close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
