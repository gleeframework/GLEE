"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic deal, and it's worth $8000 to you, so you'd be getting a great value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than the $12,000 value to her, it's still more than Bob is willing to pay. He can get the product for $8,000 from John, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
