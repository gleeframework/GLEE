I'm starting with a high price, aiming for a good profit.  I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer, but I'll also be ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 if it looks like I'm not going to get a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

$800,000 is too low for me. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway, but still aim for a price that's closer to my initial offer. I'm hoping this counteroffer is more appealing to him, and that we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price,  $900,000 is a decent offer and  it's still significantly better than selling to John for $1,000,000.  I'll take it."
