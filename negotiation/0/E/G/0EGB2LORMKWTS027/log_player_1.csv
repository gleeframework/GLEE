Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget of $1,000,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000

While continuing to negotiate with Bob might yield a slightly higher price, it's becoming clear that he's anchored to his budget of $1,000,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiation tactics wasting valuable time."
