"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,900,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,600,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,600,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? ",1300000.0,Bob,4,
