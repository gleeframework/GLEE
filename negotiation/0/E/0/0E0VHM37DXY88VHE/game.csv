"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset worth $800,000 to you, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. Let's start our negotiation.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for this valuable asset.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This reflects the value of the product for both of us, and hopefully, we can close the deal at this price. ",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to meet in the middle, but $875,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit lower than where I need to be. Let's compromise: I'm willing to lower my price to $860,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. I'm hoping we can close this deal in the next few rounds.",860000.0,Alice,5,

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $840,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so I'll offer $830,000. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",830000.0,Bob,8,
