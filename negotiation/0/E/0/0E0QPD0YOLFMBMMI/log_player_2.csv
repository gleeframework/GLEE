"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $22,000 is way above his budget.  He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $22,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should still reject the offer.  $18,000 is still more than he's willing to pay.  He can continue to negotiate with Alice or buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you value the product highly, but $18,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, $12,000 is still quite a bit lower than I can accept. To be honest, I have another potential buyer lined up for $15,000.  I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a price that reflects the product's value. Would you consider $16,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice is clearly not willing to negotiate much lower than $16,500, which is still above Bob's budget. It's better to cut his losses and buy from John for a guaranteed price of $10,000."
