,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $75 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $82.50? It's a fair price considering the value of this product.",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $78 for the product. Can we meet in the middle again?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle again. I'll offer the product to you for $80. This is my lowest price, and it's still a good deal considering the value of the product.",80.0,Alice,5,
