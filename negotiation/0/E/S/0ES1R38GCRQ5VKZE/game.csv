"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this offer?",8200.0,Bob,4,
