"I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need at least $160 to make this work. Let's find some common ground.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I understand that $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. Can you consider this revised offer?,140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $145?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $135. Can you consider this revised offer?",135.0,Bob,6,
