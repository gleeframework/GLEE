"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $180.  It's a steal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a relatively high price, aiming for a good starting point for negotiation. It's above Bob's perceived value but still gives him some room to bargain.  I'm also trying to create a sense of urgency by suggesting it's a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a big loss. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but  I need at least $160 to make this work. Let's find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 160} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price slightly, demonstrating flexibility. However, I'm still holding firm to a price that's above my minimum threshold.  I'm also trying to be encouraging by saying ""Let's find some common ground""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $140. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target. I'm not willing to sell for less than $150, so I'll reject his offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $140 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $145?  That would be a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 145} 
```

I'm proposing a compromise to Bob, meeting him halfway at $145.  It's still above my minimum acceptable price but shows flexibility. I'm also trying to appeal to his desire for a ""fair compromise""."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but $145 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $135. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to risk further negotiation with Bob.  I'm confident I can get a better price from John."
