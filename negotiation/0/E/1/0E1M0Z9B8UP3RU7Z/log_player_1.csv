Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a reasonable deal.  Going in too aggressively (close to $1,500,000) might make him walk away.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Price:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate while still being significantly above your minimum.
* **The Message:**
    *  It's positive and highlights the product's value.
    *  It positions the price as ""fair,"" encouraging Bob to engage in good faith. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate. Bob might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how low you're willing to go. Remember, you always have John as a backup buyer."
