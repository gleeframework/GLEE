"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** By starting with an offer significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a better deal.
* **Confident Tone:** Expressing confidence in the product's value might influence Bob's perception and encourage him to consider a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, the message implies willingness to negotiate, indicating flexibility to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting would mean a substantial loss for me. While selling to John is an option, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection & Justification:** I politely reject Bob's low offer, emphasizing that it doesn't reflect the product's true value. 
* **Significant Reduction but Above Minimum:** I make a substantial price reduction from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but staying well above my minimum acceptable price and leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** I continue to highlight the product's value and potential benefits to Bob, aiming to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his perceived value ($1,200,000) but is still significantly under my minimum. While I could sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm willing to gamble on one more counteroffer to see if Bob will budge closer to a price point I find acceptable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle this right now - how about $1,600,000?  This offer stands for this round only; otherwise, I'll have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Urgency & Scarcity:** I'm introducing a sense of urgency by presenting this offer as time-sensitive, pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **Firm but Fair:**  I'm holding firm on a price above my minimum but offering a small concession to show I'm willing to compromise.
* **Implied Alternative:** I subtly mention ""exploring other options"" as a reminder of my guaranteed offer from John. This reinforces the idea that Bob might miss out if he doesn't accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate the movement you've shown.  However, that last offer is still a bit too rich for me.  To be frank, I can get this product elsewhere for $1,200,000.  So, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Limit Reached:** Bob has revealed his absolute maximum price ($1,300,000), which is still below my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No Further Negotiation:**  His tone (""that's my absolute limit"") suggests he's unlikely to budge further. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my desired profit of $1,500,000. It eliminates the risk of further unsuccessful negotiations with Bob and potential loss of time.

Continuing negotiations with Bob at this point carries more risk than potential reward.  It's time to move on to the guaranteed deal with John."
