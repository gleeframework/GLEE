"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that it will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a purchase closer to  $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value while still offering you a fair deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $1,750,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems we're getting closer. While $1,250,000 is a significant jump, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Let's settle this right now - how about $1,600,000?  This offer stands for this round only; otherwise, I'll have to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate the movement you've shown.  However, that last offer is still a bit too rich for me.  To be frank, I can get this product elsewhere for $1,200,000.  So, I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, but that's my absolute limit.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
