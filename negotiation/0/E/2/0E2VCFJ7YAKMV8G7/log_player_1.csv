Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I still feel that $8,000 is a reasonable price given the current market conditions. Could we possibly get closer to that figure? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Reasoning:

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. He's consistently hovered around the $8,000-$10,000 range. Waiting for him to potentially offer closer to $12,000 is risky, and we have a guaranteed offer from John. It makes the most financial sense to take the sure $12,000 now."
