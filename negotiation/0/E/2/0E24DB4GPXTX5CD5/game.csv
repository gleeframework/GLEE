,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is significantly below what this product is worth.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  How about $975,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $975,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,012,500. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for you. ",1012500.0,Alice,5,
