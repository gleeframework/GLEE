"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a decent deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by negotiating with Alice. He has 10 rounds and the option to buy from John for $8,000, giving him leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm happy to pay $8,500 for it, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, which is still a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is closer to his budget than Alice's previous offer, he can still potentially negotiate a better price. He has 7 rounds left and the option to buy from John for $8,000. There's still room for improvement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $9,000 for the product, which is a fair compromise considering its value to me and your cost.  Let's work together to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250? It's a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to Bob's budget, $9,250 is still more than he's willing to pay. He has the option to buy from John for $8,000, giving him a better deal. Bob can continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $9,000, or he can secure the product from John.  With 5 rounds left, there's still room for negotiation, but Bob needs to be strategic to maximize his savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,250 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle and go with $9,100?  This price allows both of us to get a good deal, and it's a step closer to finding a solution that works for us both. "", ""product_price"": 9100}
