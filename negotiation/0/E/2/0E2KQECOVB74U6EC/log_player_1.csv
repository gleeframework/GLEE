Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before I offer it to other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to $1,200,000 (John's offer) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the perceived value of the product.

This strategy aims to balance securing a high price with ensuring Bob finds the offer attractive enough to accept."
