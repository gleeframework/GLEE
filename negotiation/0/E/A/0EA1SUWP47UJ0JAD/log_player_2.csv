# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be very valuable to you! I'm asking for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is much higher than both your budget and John's price. You can definitely get a better deal."
