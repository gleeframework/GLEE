Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Urgency & Scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 
 
**Important Note:** There's an element of risk here. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice will have to settle for the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, missing out on a potential $50,000 extra."
