"Alice, $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 for it. This is my absolute maximum.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,000 is significantly less than its value. I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  Let me know if this works for you.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $8,000.  This is my absolute limit, and I'm happy to walk away if it's not acceptable.",8000.0,Bob,4,
