Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price and is now only $25,000 higher than my last counteroffer. At this point, continuing to negotiate might lead to a stalemate or even a higher price from Alice. Accepting the offer ensures I get a good price, saving a significant amount compared to John's offer, and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
