Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product that I know will be a valuable asset to your business.  My initial offer is $900,000. I believe this price reflects the value of the product and offers you a great opportunity for a significant return on investment."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend no more than $800000 for this product.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price.**  You've stated the product is worth at least $800,000 to you, so accepting this offer ensures you don't lose money.
* **There's no guarantee of a better offer in future rounds.**  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Bob will walk away, or that you'll waste rounds and still end up with the same price. 
* **Selling to John offers no advantage.**  John is also willing to pay $800,000, so there's no reason to switch buyers. 

By accepting Bob's offer, you get your minimum desired price and close the deal quickly."
