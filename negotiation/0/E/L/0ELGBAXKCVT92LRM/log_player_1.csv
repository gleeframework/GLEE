Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $75?

While Bob is showing interest, his offers are too far below my minimum price. It's unlikely we'll reach an agreement that works for both of us.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum price."
