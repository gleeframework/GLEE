Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, though. I'll meet you at $800,000, but I'll throw in some additional value-added services worth $20,000. This way, you'll get the product and some extra benefits to help you get the most out of it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** Alice has explicitly stated she won't go below $800,000, which is her value for the product. 
* **Added Value:** While the additional services might not be worth the full $20,000 to you, they represent some extra benefit.
* **Time Saved:** Accepting now avoids potential back-and-forth and secures the product.

It's unlikely you'll get a better deal from Alice at this point, and continuing the negotiation might lead to an impasse."
