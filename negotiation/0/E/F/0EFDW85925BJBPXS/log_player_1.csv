I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good deal for both of us: 

* I get a price closer to my value of $15,000.
* Bob gets the product for a price significantly lower than what he'd be willing to pay ($8,000).

If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for $15,000, ensuring I meet my minimum price."
