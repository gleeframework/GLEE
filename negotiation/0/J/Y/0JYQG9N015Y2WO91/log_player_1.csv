{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer represents a good starting point:

* **It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum acceptable price:** This leaves you room to negotiate downwards if necessary. 

I'm aiming for a win-win situation here. Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to get the best price possible, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a figure closer to $1,100,000 to make this work.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a solution that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

This counteroffer attempts to:

* **Show flexibility:** I've lowered my price from $1,250,000 to $1,100,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Appeal to Bob's sense of fairness:** I'm emphasizing that a mutually beneficial agreement is possible.

Let's see if this counteroffer is more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $1,050,000 is still below my ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and this offer is closer to my minimum. Accepting it allows me to avoid the risk of further negotiation or a potential deadlock, while still securing a significant profit."
