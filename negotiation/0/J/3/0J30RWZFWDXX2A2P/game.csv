"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly exceptional. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and exclusivity.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950000 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $1050000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make another serious offer of $980000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",980000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to make a serious offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $980000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer: $1025000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting nowhere. I'm willing to make one last serious offer of $990000. I think this is as high as I'm willing to go, and I'm starting to think that buying from John might be a better option for me. I'd like to hear from you before I make a decision.",990000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand that you're willing to make a final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $990000. I'm willing to make one last counteroffer: $1010000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm confident we can finalize the deal.",1010000.0,Alice,9,
