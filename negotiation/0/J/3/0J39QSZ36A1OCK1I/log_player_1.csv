{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $10,000 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** This price is lower than your minimum of $12,000 but gives you some flexibility. 
* **It's a strong opening:**  It shows you're serious about selling but also leaves room for compromise. 

By starting at $10,000, you can gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price, while still being able to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $8,000. Would you consider selling the product to me for $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value, but it's closer to my desired price.  I'll reject it and counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit lower than I can go.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows us both to get a good deal. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still aiming to keep my investment within $8,000. Could we possibly agree on $9,000? Thank you for considering my request. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is insistent on his $9,000 offer, and while it's closer to my minimum, it's still below it. I'm not willing to go any lower, and I can't risk another round of negotiations.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum, so I'll sell to him."
