"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. It's an excellent value considering its worth to us is $150 and its high quality. I believe this price reflects both the value we place on it and the value you would derive from it. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $80. Our product is valued at $150 to us due to its quality and unique features. We're unable to match that price point, but I encourage you to consider our product's long-term benefits. If you're interested in discussing further, please let me know.

Alice rejecting our offer and increasing the price to $150 shows she's not willing to negotiate within a reasonable range of our budget. It's better to secure the product from John at $100 than to continue haggling with Alice."
