"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the information about the product.  However, I'm working with a tighter budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. While I understand your budget constraints, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer of $80. Our product is valued at $150 to us due to its quality and unique features. We're unable to match that price point, but I encourage you to consider our product's long-term benefits. If you're interested in discussing further, please let me know.",150.0,Alice,3,
