Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a price that's higher than my minimum value of $100, giving me a good profit if he accepts. However, it's also not so high that it's likely to be rejected out of hand. If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell it to John for $100, ensuring I don't lose money."
