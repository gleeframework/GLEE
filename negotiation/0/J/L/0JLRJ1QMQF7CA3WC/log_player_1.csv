Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is closer to my desired price point. This allows for negotiation room.
* **Appeal to Value:** I emphasize the value of the product to Bob, hoping to motivate him to accept a price closer to my asking price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open-ended, inviting Bob to respond and start a dialogue. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I've made a good profit.
* **Bob Rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. If his offer is too low, I'll move on to John for my guaranteed $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. I am willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This price aligns more closely with its value to me. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than my desired value for the product. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I can likely get closer to my goal by making a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but it's not my ideal outcome. I'd rather see if I can get closer to that amount through negotiation with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While it's closer to my asking price, it's still a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer to show I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:**  I'm framing the price as ""fair"" to both parties. 
* **Maintain Leverage:** I'm not giving too much away, still aiming for a price above $850,000. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** My message is positive and inviting, suggesting a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great!  I've secured a good price. 
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide on my next move. If he goes too low again, I'll likely sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but I must stick to my budget. I am willing to pay $860,000 for the product. This price reflects its value to me while staying within my financial limits. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $860,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $860,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $860,000 is only $15,000 away from my last counteroffer of $875,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal of $900,000, continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether. 
* **Time Factor:**  Further negotiation could be time-consuming, and selling to John is always an option, but his guaranteed $1,000,000 might not be worth the risk of losing Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will accept Bob's offer, securing a sale and a reasonable profit."
