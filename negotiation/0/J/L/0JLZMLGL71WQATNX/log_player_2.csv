You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $115?  This is still a fair price for both of us.

Alice is coming closer to your price, but there's still room for negotiation. You can try countering again to see if you can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  How about we split the difference this time and go with $111?  That way we both get a little closer to our desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $111

Alice is very close to your maximum price, and further haggling might make you lose the deal. Accepting at $111 gets you the product for less than John's price."
