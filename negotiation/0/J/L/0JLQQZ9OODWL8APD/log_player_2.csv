"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this is a great deal. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy from John for $12,000. Rejecting this offer might lead Alice to propose a lower price, closer to her product value of $8,000.  You stand to save $1,000 by potentially negotiating a better deal with Alice."
