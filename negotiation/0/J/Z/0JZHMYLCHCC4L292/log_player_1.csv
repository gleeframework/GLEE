Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find quite valuable.  I'm asking for $130. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $150 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **John as Backup:** You have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob refuses.

By offering the product at $130, you aim for a price significantly higher than your minimum while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal ($20 less than his perceived value). This strategy maximizes your potential profit while still making the offer attractive to Bob."
