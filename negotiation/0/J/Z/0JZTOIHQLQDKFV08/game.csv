"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1300000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Considering the value to me, I'd be comfortable paying $1150000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1150000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1250000 to make this deal work.  This price still reflects the value of the product to you, and allows for a fair profit for me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer $1200000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for my business.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
