"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I understand your perspective on the value, the  $20,000 price reflects the true worth of this product and its potential benefits for you. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value you'll gain.",17000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000, but I'm still not convinced that's a good deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $14,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
