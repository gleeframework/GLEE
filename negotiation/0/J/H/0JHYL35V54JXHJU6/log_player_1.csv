Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,375,000 is fair for both of us. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, our goal is to maximize profit.  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so there's room for negotiation.
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $1,375,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant gain above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:** The message implies the product's value and encourages Bob to consider the offer seriously. 
* **Alternative:** If we started too high (close to $1,500,000), Bob might walk away immediately. This offer gives him a reason to engage in the negotiation."
