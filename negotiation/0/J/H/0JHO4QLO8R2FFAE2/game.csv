"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly, and I'm confident it would be a great addition to your collection. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you won't be disappointed. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
