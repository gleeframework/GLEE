"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",850000.0,Alice,1,,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $750000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $820000. This is the best I can do at this time.",820000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $780000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",780000.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I've already compromised by meeting you halfway and then again by offering $810000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $810000, but I need you to meet me at this point. This is my final offer.",810000.0,Alice,5,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm not interested in going over that price, and I'm starting to think about buying from John.",800000.0,Bob,6,,
