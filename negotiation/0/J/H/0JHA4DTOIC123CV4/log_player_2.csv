"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll see the value it brings. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. He can get the product for a lower price from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to save as much as possible.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'm looking for.  Let's see if we can make a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but unfortunately, $950000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $1025000? It's a fair price that still allows you to save a substantial amount, while also ensuring I get a fair return on my investment. Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob can get from John. It makes more sense for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiations."
