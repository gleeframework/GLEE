Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $14,000. I think it could be very beneficial for you, and this offer is a steal compared to what others might pay."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible without going below our minimum ($15,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer.  He may be willing to pay more than $8,000, and we want to give him the opportunity.
* **Strong Alternative:** We have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, which gives us a strong position. We don't need to desperately lowball Bob.

**The strategy is to anchor Bob's perception of the price at a higher point while leaving room open for negotiation that could lead to a sale above our minimum.**"
