**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above what you're willing to pay. You can definitely negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of 1100000 for the product. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to your target price, but there's still room for negotiation.  You can try to get the price down a bit further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1,050,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below 1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. Let's meet at 1080000 and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and the current price of $1,080,000 is a good deal for you.  It's significantly less than what John is offering, and you've already established that this is a valuable product.  You can likely make up the difference through the product's potential benefits.  There's not much more to gain by continuing to negotiate at this point."
