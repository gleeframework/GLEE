"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this time. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1000000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of 1100000 for the product. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference and settle on $1050000. This would be a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your proposal, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not comfortable going below 1080000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. I'm willing to make one more concession to reach a deal. Let's meet at 1080000 and see if we can come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
