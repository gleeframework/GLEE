"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's start the negotiation off strong!",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $900,000?  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and still leaves room for you to make a profit.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be closer to $900,000. How about $887,500? This would allow both of us to walk away happy with the deal.",887500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get closer to your desired price, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $882,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",882500.0,Bob,6,
