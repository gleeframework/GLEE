"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than both your maximum price and John's price. It makes sense to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer! However, I believe the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

This counter-offer starts the negotiation significantly below Alice's asking price but still leaves room for negotiation while staying above Alice's value for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $70 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a price you'd accept, $90 is still above your target. It's worth countering again to see if you can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $80? That feels like a fair deal to me."", 
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer:

* **Aims for a price you're comfortable with:** $80 is a good price point for you and leaves you with some savings.
* **Presents it as a fair deal:** By framing it as a fair compromise, you increase the chances of Alice accepting.
* **Is firm but polite:** You're clear about the price you're willing to pay without being aggressive."
