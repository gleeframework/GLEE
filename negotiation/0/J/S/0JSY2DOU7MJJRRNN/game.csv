"Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a good price, and I get a fair return on my investment. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me as well.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which still gives you a significant value for the product. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
