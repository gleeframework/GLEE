Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and highlights the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option, so I'm not desperate to close with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product for a good price.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $800,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. There's a chance we can reach a compromise through further negotiation.
* **John is a safe backup:**  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so I'm not under pressure to accept a bad deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired price range. I'll aim for a compromise that's acceptable to both of us, but I won't settle for anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a great deal for you. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) but still significantly higher than Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to negotiate.
* **Compromise:** I'm framing the counter offer as a compromise and a ""good deal"" for Bob.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product for Bob and using positive language.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Excellent! We've reached a mutually agreeable price.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll need to carefully analyze his counteroffer.  Depending on the price, I may make another counteroffer or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price.  How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $1,000,000? That seems like a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** $1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation has stalled:**  Bob's offer is not significantly better than his initial offer, indicating he's unlikely to go higher.
* **John is my backup:** John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will go with John.  It's a much safer bet to get my desired price without the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a stalemate."
