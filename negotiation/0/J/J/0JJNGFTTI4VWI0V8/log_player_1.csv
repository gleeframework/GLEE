Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While I agree it could be useful, $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be a fair price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I value the product at.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $9,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $9,250?"", ""product_price"": 9250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. While $9,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider $7,800?

You have three options:

Bob is not showing a willingness to meet near my minimum price.  It's time to move on to John who is offering a price that guarantees my minimum."
