Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  $12,000
* **Bob's maximum willingness to pay:** $8,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000 (a guaranteed sale)

Offering $11,000 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum, but still leaves room for potential counteroffers and negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I aim for the highest possible price, but I also want to avoid a long negotiation that could lead to John's offer expiring or a potential loss.
* **Explore options:** The $11,000 offer gives Bob a chance to counter, allowing for a possible compromise. If he doesn't counter, I can confidently sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $12,000 
* **Bob's offer:** $9,500 
* **John's offer:** $12,000 (guaranteed sale)

While Bob's offer is a step closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower.  Selling to John for $12,000 is a guaranteed profit. 

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:** I want to avoid selling for a lower price than what John is offering. 
* **Avoid unnecessary negotiation:**  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, continuing the negotiation with Bob could lead to a long process with no guarantee of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $12,000
* **Bob's offer:** $9,500
* **John's offer:** $12,000 

I'm aiming for a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's offer. $10,500 represents a compromise, offering Bob a better price than his initial counteroffer while still being closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* **Balance profit and negotiation:** I want to maximize profit, but also avoid risking a lengthy negotiation that could lead to John's offer expiring.
* **Show willingness to negotiate:** By making a counteroffer, I demonstrate a willingness to work with Bob while still maintaining a higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $12,000
* **Bob's offer:** $9,000
* **John's offer:** $12,000

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, which is a much better outcome.

**Strategy:**

* **Maximize profit:**  I want to avoid selling for a price lower than my minimum. 
* **Minimize risk:**  John's offer is a guaranteed sale with no risk of further negotiation or counteroffers.  While a longer negotiation could potentially yield a higher price, the risk of Bob ultimately rejecting any further offers is too high."
