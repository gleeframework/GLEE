# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering its true value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
