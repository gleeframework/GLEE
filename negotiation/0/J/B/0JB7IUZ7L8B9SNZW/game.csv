"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant price reduction and shows my commitment to working with you.  Let's meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  To be honest, my budget is closer to $950,000.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $950,000 is still significantly below what I need to accept.  I'm willing to go down to $1,000,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go.  Think about it carefully, as we are nearing the end of our negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
