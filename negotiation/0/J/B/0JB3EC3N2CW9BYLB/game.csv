"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in my product. After considering your proposal, I believe there might be some room for negotiation.

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. While I appreciate the additional benefits, they do not justify the increase in price. Given my current budget, I am unable to accept $120. I would like to make one final counteroffer at $110. This price reflects the value I see in your product while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",110.0,Bob,4,
