# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While I'd love to strike a deal with Bob, it seems like we're at an impasse.  I've already made significant concessions, and I don't want to risk losing out on a guaranteed higher price from John."
