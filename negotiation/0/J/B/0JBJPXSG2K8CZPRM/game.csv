"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but I'm not able to go that high. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a significant investment for me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you've come down in price, and I appreciate your efforts.  I'm still limited to $1,150,000, and I really don't want to go any higher. If you can come down to that number, we can finalize this deal. Otherwise, I might have to consider other options.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
