"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love! I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110. It's a great deal for a product you value at $150! Let's find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a good price for Bob. While Bob could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  It's a good deal for Bob, and he's still saving $40 compared to buying from John."
