Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $1,000,000 is higher than what Bob thinks the product is worth, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum value:** $1,000,000 is still higher than your minimum of $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects the offer.
* **It's a clear and direct message:** The message is concise and focuses on the value proposition for Bob.

By offering this price, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further. If he rejects the offer, you can then decide if you want to counter or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  There's a substantial gap, and accepting it would result in a significant loss for you. 

While you're willing to negotiate, it's important to maintain a strong position. Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a more favorable price, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial agreement. You could also ultimately choose to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $900,000? This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal as well."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:**  $900,000 is still below your minimum of $1,200,000, so you're not losing money. 
* **Middle ground:** $900,000 is a midpoint between your previous offer of $1,000,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $600,000, demonstrating your willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasize value:** The message reiterates your desire to ensure a fair deal for both parties. 

By offering $900,000, you show flexibility while still maintaining a strong position.  It will be interesting to see if Bob accepts this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $850000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal for you considering you could sell to John for $1,200,000 but would have to pay any associated transaction fees. 

While you could try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee you'd get a higher price, and you might risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, which is a good outcome in this situation."
