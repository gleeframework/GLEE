"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, Bob can likely get a better deal. It's worth exploring counteroffers before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $120 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $105 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive but not too aggressive. He's offering a price closer to Alice's minimum value, hoping to close the deal quickly while still getting a good price for himself."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 was a bit high, but I'm still looking for a good profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is better than $120, Bob still has room to negotiate.  There's no need to rush into a deal, especially with John's $150 offer as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $115 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $110.  If you're serious about selling, I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's desired price, but he's still trying to squeeze out a bit more.  He's showing that he's serious about buying, but he's not going to give in easily."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $112. It's a great product, and I think it's worth a bit more than that. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now offering $112, which is only $2 more than Bob's last counteroffer. This is a good deal for Bob considering his maximum price is $150.  The risk of further negotiation could lead to Alice walking away, or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price.  It's time to close the deal."
