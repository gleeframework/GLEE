"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",92.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $92 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $88.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $88 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $91. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'll be happy with the product.",91.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go any higher than $92, Bob. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's agree on $92 and call it a deal.",92.0,Alice,7,
