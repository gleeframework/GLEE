"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $90. This means Bob can potentially save $30.
* It's worth exploring if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to work with me. However, $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at the moment.  I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $85 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $92? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $92 is better than $120, it's still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer of $85. 
* There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try for a price closer to his desired range."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $92 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you closer to the middle at $88.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident I'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 88}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $88 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

*  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $95 is better than $120, it's still higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $88 and getting closer to the price of John's offer.
* There's still a chance to negotiate further, and rejecting allows Bob to continue bargaining for a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $95 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and agree on $91. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure I'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 91}

Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has consistently been willing to negotiate, but seems firm on $92.  
*  Rejecting and counteroffering again could lead to a stalemate, as Alice has already rejected a lower offer.
* Accepting the $92 offer allows Bob to get the product for less than what John is selling it for, and is a reasonable compromise."
