"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. This product would be valuable to me, but $900,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $700,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. While $850,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be open to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing to discuss the price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider meeting me in the middle at $800,000? This would be a win-win for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,6,
