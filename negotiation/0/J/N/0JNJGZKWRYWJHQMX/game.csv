"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $11,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",11500.0,Alice,3,
