Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to secure a price closer to my minimum.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** $1,400,000 allows for negotiation, giving Bob a sense that he can get a better deal.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing fairness and encouraging a dialogue, rather than being confrontational. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll analyze his counteroffer and assess whether it's worth continuing the negotiation.
* **If Bob accepts:** I've achieved a satisfactory outcome. 
* **If negotiation stalls:** I'll exercise my option of selling to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.**  I cannot afford to sell for $1,100,000 as it's below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **I need to explore counteroffers to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.** I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I might be able to get a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* **I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, likely somewhere between his offer and my initial offer.**  I'll try to find a middle ground that is still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1,100,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for some flexibility. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards Middle Ground:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Still Profitable:**  $1,300,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring that I don't sell at a loss.
* **Maintaining Positive Tone:** I'm continuing to emphasize collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial solution. 

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:**  I've achieved a successful negotiation.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**
