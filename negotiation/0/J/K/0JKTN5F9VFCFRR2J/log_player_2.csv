"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exclusive opportunity worth $10,000 to me, but I understand its value to you is $8,000. To start, let's aim for a fair deal. How about we discuss it at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,000 is a decent price, it's still more than Bob's maximum value. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I believe this price would be fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
