Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's an exclusive opportunity worth $10,000 to me, but I understand its value to you is $8,000. To start, let's aim for a fair deal. How about we discuss it at $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your understanding of my budget. However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to come down to $8,500? I believe this price would be fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
