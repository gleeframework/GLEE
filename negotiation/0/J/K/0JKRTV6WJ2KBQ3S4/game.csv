"Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 isn't quite high enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000? This gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
