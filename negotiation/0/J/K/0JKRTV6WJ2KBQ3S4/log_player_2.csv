"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above Alice's minimum value.  There's room for negotiation to get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to get a better price. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is still a good profit for you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 isn't quite high enough for me.  Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,050,000? This gives you a significant saving compared to your estimated value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Bob is aiming to save as much as possible, so continuing to negotiate and aiming for a price closer to $950,000 is still worthwhile."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  I'm still looking for a slightly better price. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
