"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $12,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While I'm willing to negotiate, $9,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm happy to come down to $10,500. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need for the product. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $9,750 is still too far below my desired price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,250. This offers a good compromise for both of us. What do you say?",10250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $10,250 is the best price for me. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,6,
