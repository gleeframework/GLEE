Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $800,000. I can do $825,000, which is my final offer. If you're not interested, I have other buyers waiting

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice seems firm and the difference is becoming smaller.  It's better to secure the deal at $825,000 than risk her selling to someone else and having to pay John $1,000,000."
