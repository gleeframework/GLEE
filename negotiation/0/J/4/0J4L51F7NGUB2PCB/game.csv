"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd be a great fit for it. I'm offering it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to make a deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $9,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,5,
