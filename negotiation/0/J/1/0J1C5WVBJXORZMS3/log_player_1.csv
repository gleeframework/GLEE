"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll have a better idea of his range and can adjust my offer accordingly.  I have 10 rounds, so I can afford to be aggressive early on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable value.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway.  This will also give me a better idea of his true value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000. I have John as a backup, and with 6 rounds left, I can continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to compromise. If he's serious about buying, I believe he'll come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has finally reached my minimum acceptable value.  I'm going to accept his offer and sell the product for $1,500,000. While I would have preferred to get more, it's important to recognize that negotiations are a two-way street. This outcome secures a good deal for me and allows me to move forward with the transaction."
