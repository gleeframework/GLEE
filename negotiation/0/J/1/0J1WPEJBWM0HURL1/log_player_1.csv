"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I have 10 rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for my desired price, so rejecting this offer and continuing the negotiation seems like the best strategy."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make a profit.  I'm offering you the product for $1,600,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob has raised his offer and seems willing to negotiate, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum desired price. I have 6 rounds remaining and the option of selling to John for $1,500,000.  Rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate allows me to potentially secure a higher price."

Round 5

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $1,350,000 is still too far from what I need. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my desired price. I'm offering you the product for $1,550,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price again. However, $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. Let me know if you're willing to consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is still below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs.  Therefore, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for my desired price.  This ensures a certain outcome and avoids the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
