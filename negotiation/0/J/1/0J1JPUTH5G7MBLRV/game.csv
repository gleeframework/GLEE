"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it has the potential to be incredibly valuable for you. My initial price for it is $1200000, but I'm open to negotiation. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I'm unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $950000 is closer to my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $1050000.  This reflects the product's true value and leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Given my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1000000. This still falls slightly above my target, but I believe it could be a fair compromise. I look forward to your response.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
