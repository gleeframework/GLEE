"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145?  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $137.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",137.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $137.50 is still below what I need to get for this product. I'm willing to come down to $142.50. This is a final offer, and if you're not able to meet me there, I'll have to move on.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to make a profit, but $142.50 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",140.0,Bob,6,
