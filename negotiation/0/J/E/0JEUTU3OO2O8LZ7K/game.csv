"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me for this product, but  $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know if that's a possibility for you.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $16,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that high.  I'm happy to meet you at $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it's the absolute maximum I can spend.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to sell it for that low. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is as close as I can get to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
