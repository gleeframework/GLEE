"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" and emphasizing the value to Bob. This helps build a positive rapport.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm asking for Bob's thoughts, showing I'm open to negotiation and willing to find a mutually agreeable price.

**Strategy:** 

I'm aiming for a quick deal, but I want to leave enough room for negotiation in case Bob pushes back.  I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response in the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $8,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $8,500 is significantly below my minimum price of $10,000.  I'm not willing to settle for that low of a price right now. 
* **Negotiation is Needed:** I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a price that works for both of us. I'm not ready to sell to John yet. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm going to make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with Justification:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. I'm providing a reason for my price, focusing on the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm emphasizing my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. 
* **Strategic Approach:** By offering a lower price but still keeping it above my minimum, I'm trying to gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. This would be a good compromise and a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While $8,750 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  I'm not yet ready to settle for that price. 
* **Negotiation is Ongoing:**  We're making progress, and Bob's counteroffer shows he's willing to move up.  I believe there's still room for negotiation to find a more favorable price for me. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:**  I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price. 

**Reasoning:**

Selling to John for $10,000 would be the easiest option, but I believe I can still get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation.  $8,750 is a decent offer, but I'm willing to risk another round or two to see if I can push Bob a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,750 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,875.  This price is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away with a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8875}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a Compromise:** I'm making a counteroffer that's only slightly higher than Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Focus on a Fair Deal:**  I'm emphasizing that this price is a ""fair compromise"" and a good deal for both of us. 
* **Strategic Approach:** I'm aiming for a quick deal by offering a price that's very close to Bob's.  I believe this might encourage Bob to accept.

**Reasoning:**

I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I don't want to risk losing Bob entirely by pushing for a much higher price. Offering a compromise that's only a little higher than Bob's last offer might be enough to get him to agree, allowing me to close the deal sooner.  I'm still willing to walk away and sell to John, but I'm also trying to be flexible and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,000.  Let's split the difference and go with $8,500. This would be a win-win for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:** While Bob has offered to ""split the difference,"" $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum price of $10,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We are halfway through the negotiation process, and I need to start considering the time factor. However, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm going to make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to my desired price.  I'll need to be more aggressive in my counteroffer to signal that I'm serious about getting a better deal.

**Reasoning:**

While selling to John for $10,000 would be the easiest option, I'm still holding out hope for a better deal with Bob.  I'm confident I can push Bob a little higher with a more assertive counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're aiming for a price closer to $8,000. However, I'm firm on my minimum price of $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. If you're serious about making a deal, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,900. This would be a good compromise and allow us to both walk away satisfied. "", ""product_price"": 8900}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Firm on Minimum:**  I'm stating my minimum price clearly, demonstrating that I'm not willing to go lower.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to Bob, justifying my minimum price.

* **Strong Tone:** The message has a slightly more assertive tone, emphasizing my desire to reach an agreement but also showcasing my resolve.

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, I need to be more assertive in my approach. I'm making a substantial concession to show my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still holding firm on my minimum price. By stating my minimum clearly and offering a final compromise, I'm hoping to convince Bob that this is the best deal he's going to get. If he rejects this offer, I will seriously consider selling to John."
