"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm definitely interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000? I think that's a fair price.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget.  How about $7,000?  That's a solid offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stick to a budget, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
