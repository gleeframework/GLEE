"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $1200000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $950000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $1000000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
