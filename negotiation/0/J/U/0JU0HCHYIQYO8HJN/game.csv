"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,200. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm willing to bump my offer up to $7,800. However, I think that's a fair final offer.",7800.0,Bob,6,
