"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it's fair considering the value it brings.  Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay closer to my original offer.  How about $1,000,000?  This would still allow you a good profit, and it's closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our offers. How about $950,000? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway, but $950,000 still leaves me too far from where I need to be.  If you're serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end.  Let's see if we can finalize this negotiation.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're making a compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,020,000, but no higher. I think this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your effort, $1,020,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,040,000, which is a compromise on both sides.  Let's get this done.",1040000.0,Alice,7,
