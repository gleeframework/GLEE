Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your budget constraints. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice has come down in price, but it's still above John's offer. There's no guarantee Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation risks exceeding my budget."
