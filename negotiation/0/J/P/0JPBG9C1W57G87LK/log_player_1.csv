Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that still leaves me with a good profit margin. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but might be tempting enough to avoid him risking losing the deal. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, avoids potential delays in selling to John. 

This offer balances the desire for the highest possible profit with the understanding that Bob might reject a very high offer."
