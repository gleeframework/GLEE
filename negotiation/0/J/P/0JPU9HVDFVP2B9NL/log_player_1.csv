"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100, a bit higher than my minimum, to see if Bob is interested in paying a premium.  I'll adjust based on his response and the number of rounds remaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price, especially since I have 8 rounds left. I'm going to try to counter-offer and see if I can close the deal at a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm counter-offering with $95. This is a compromise, but it's still a bit higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects this, I'll consider lowering my price further in the next round, but I'll keep in mind the option of selling to John for $80."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $85 is a fair compromise and better than selling to John for $80. With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate."
