Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,300,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob, while also setting a clear price point.

**Why this approach?**

* **Initial High Offer:** Starting high allows for room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Room for Compromise:** There's still a decent gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value, leaving space for counteroffers and potential agreement.
* **John as Leverage:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a strong fallback position.  This knowledge will help me push for a higher price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value the product holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell for such a low amount, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who will pay much more.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer of $1,300,000, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us.  I will use the knowledge of John's offer as leverage to encourage Bob to increase his bid."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to a fair value for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:**  I'm offering $1,100,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $900,000. 
* **Message:** My message remains friendly but firm. I acknowledge Bob's desire for a good deal while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for mutual benefit. 
* **Leverage:**  I subtly remind Bob that I have other options, but I'm still willing to work with him. This keeps the pressure on while showing a desire to negotiate.

**Why this approach?**

* **Reasonable Counter:**  This counteroffer is a logical step, showing a willingness to compromise without completely surrendering my position.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, ensuring I don't lose too much money.
* **Keeping Negotiation Open:**  This counteroffer keeps the dialogue open and allows for further negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $950,000. I think this price is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your concession to $1,050,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget, and I'm willing to go one step further. I'm offering $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $975,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to further compromise my financial goals.  

Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) who is willing to pay my minimum price, it's in my best interest to sell the product to him.  This ensures I receive the maximum value for my product and avoid any further negotiation with Bob."
