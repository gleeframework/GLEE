"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, considering the value the product holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the product's value and the potential it holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  I'm proposing $1,100,000. This price still gives you a significant discount from my initial offer, and it's closer to a fair value for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits everyone.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $950,000. I think this price is a fair middle ground that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued efforts to find a compromise.  However, $950,000 is still not in the range I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product for you.  Let's make this deal happen, but we need to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to this offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your concession to $1,050,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget, and I'm willing to go one step further. I'm offering $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle again.",975000.0,Bob,6,
