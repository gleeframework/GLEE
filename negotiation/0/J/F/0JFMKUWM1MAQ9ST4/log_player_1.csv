Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a decent profit margin. Let's see if we can work something out.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However,  $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can offer. This is a fair price that provides a good margin for you and allows me to achieve my budget goals. Let's see if we can close this deal.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $1,000,000 is a good price and represents a significant profit. It's better than selling to John for $800,000 and I'm confident I can use the funds to invest in my own business."
