Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $100."", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $80 from John, so any offer below that is pointless.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Starting at $100 allows room for negotiation downwards while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between a price appealing to Bob while still maximizing your potential earnings."
