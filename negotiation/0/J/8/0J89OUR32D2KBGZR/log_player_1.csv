Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110, which is a great deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 
 
I'm offering Bob a price of $110. This is above his perceived value of $80 but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows me to make some profit while not entirely ruling out a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer because it is below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I want to try to get a better price, but I will also keep John in mind as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal. "", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $100. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable price, but it shows that I am willing to negotiate and reach a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer, if you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. Bob's comment about going with John is a clear signal that he's not willing to budge much. It's time to secure a guaranteed deal with John at $120, ensuring I don't lose out on potential profit."
