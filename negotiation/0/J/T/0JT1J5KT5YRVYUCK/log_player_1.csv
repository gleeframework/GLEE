{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving you room to negotiate.  It's important to be polite and positive while remaining firm in your desire for a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $900,000 is unfortunately below my minimum selling price.  I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $950,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  It's becoming clear that further negotiation with Bob may not lead to a satisfactory outcome.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
