"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make sure this product is a good fit for you.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is a very competitive price for a product of this quality.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $15,000 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're getting close! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and settle at $13,250? That's my final offer.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While $13,250 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit over my budget. I can offer you $10,500 as my final offer. If that doesn't work, I might have to consider other options.",10500.0,Bob,6,
