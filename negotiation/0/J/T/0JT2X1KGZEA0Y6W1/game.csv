"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would give you a great deal while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the value of this product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
