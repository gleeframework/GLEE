Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,200,000:**  This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, which allows me to potentially accept a counteroffer. 
* **Message:** A friendly and encouraging message that emphasizes the value of the product and leaves the door open for discussion.

**Strategy:**

* **Starting high:** This sets the initial expectation and allows for potential concessions later.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This encourages Bob to counteroffer, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Having a backup plan:** The option to sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a safety net if negotiations fail. 

I'll wait for Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can reach a price closer to my desired range. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for higher price:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to push for a higher price in the next round. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The fact that I have a backup buyer in John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage in negotiations. 
* **Testing the waters:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to gauge his seriousness and willingness to compromise. 

**Next steps:**

I will now send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your offer, $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This would give you a great deal while ensuring I can fairly compensate for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer meets Bob halfway between his offer ($900,000) and my previous offer ($1,200,000). This shows my willingness to negotiate and reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Justifying the price:**  I reiterate the value of the product and highlight the benefit Bob would receive by acquiring it for this price.
* **Leaving the door open:**  The message encourages further discussion and potentially leads to a final agreement.

**Strategy:**

* **Focusing on a win-win:** This approach emphasizes that both parties can benefit from a successful transaction.
* **Positioning myself strategically:** This price is closer to my desired range but still within a reasonable distance from Bob's offer.
* **Using persuasive language:**  The message highlights the value and benefits for Bob, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.

I will continue to analyze Bob's responses and adjust my strategy accordingly to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's my final offer. I really want this product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm tempted to continue negotiating, Bob's offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  It's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.  Given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,000,000, it's in my best interest to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a stalemate:**  Bob's ""final offer"" indicates that further negotiation is unlikely to result in a higher price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,000,000, which meets my minimum requirement.
* **Minimizing risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of a prolonged process with an uncertain outcome. 

**Conclusion:**

By selling to John, I can secure a profitable sale quickly and efficiently, eliminating the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
