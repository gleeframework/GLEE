"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is motivated to sell.** She has other interested parties, meaning she's likely to negotiate. 
* **You have a fallback option.** John offers a safety net, ensuring you can get the product even if you reject Alice's initial offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  Alice's offer is closer to your maximum budget than it is to her minimum acceptable price. There's a decent chance she'll come down to avoid losing the sale."
