Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a good starting point because it's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but it also leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my ideal price, but still higher than what John is willing to pay. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer. I want to secure a higher price, but I need to be careful not to push him away completely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward and shows a willingness to be flexible while still aiming for a profitable sale."
