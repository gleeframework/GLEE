Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would significantly benefit you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This offer stands for a limited time as I already have a strong offer from another party."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for a price close to your minimum ($1,200,000) maximizes your potential profit.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning another buyer creates urgency and may encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting slightly higher than John's offer allows for potential negotiation if Bob attempts to counter-offer.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are willing to risk losing Bob as a buyer to potentially secure a higher price. If you prioritize a guaranteed sale, offering a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($800,000) would be a safer approach."
