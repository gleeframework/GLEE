Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation but still represents a significant profit for me. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, $1,000,000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if we can find a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping it's a more reasonable price for Bob. I'm willing to come down from my initial offer, but I won't go below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a price I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to accept a slight loss to avoid further negotiation, and John's offer of $1,200,000 is a better option at this point."
