"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $8,500? This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this deal work.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $7,800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be within my budget.",7800.0,Bob,4,
