"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I can't go as low as $115.  How about we meet in the middle at $122?",122.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice, but $122 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $118. That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy.",118.0,Bob,4,
