"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the product's value, that price point is too high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $600,000 is a bit below your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $900,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. However, I need to be closer to my minimum price to make this deal worthwhile for me. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,
