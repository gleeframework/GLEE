"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I appreciate your offer,  $850,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $900,000,  which is still a significant value for you.  This offer reflects a compromise and demonstrates my commitment to working with you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $875,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still committed to getting as close to $900,000 as possible. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $887,500. This is a fair compromise that will allow us both to benefit from this deal.  What do you say?",887500.0,Alice,5,
