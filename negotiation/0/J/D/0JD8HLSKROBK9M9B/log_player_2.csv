"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While $8,000 is significantly lower than Alice's asking price, it's a strong opening move in the negotiation. It establishes your budget constraints and leaves room for bargaining.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states your position.
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer will help you understand how willing Alice is to negotiate and how far apart your valuations truly are."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:**  Alice moving down to $12,000 shows flexibility. This suggests there's a good chance of meeting somewhere in the middle.
* **Target Price in Sight:** Your goal is to get the price as close to $10,000 as possible. With some back-and-forth, you can likely reach a price that saves you even more money compared to buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Steady Progression:**  This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to move toward a deal while still aiming for significant savings.
* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** By suggesting $9,500, you're essentially splitting the difference between your previous offer ($8,000) and her current offer ($12,000), but with a slight lean in your favor. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will help gauge how close Alice is willing to get to your $10,000 walk-away point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Alice is only moving down $1,000 at a time now, while you're still aiming to save as much as possible. 
* **Leverage John:** You have a strong alternative with John's offer at $10,000.  Alice needs to get closer to that price for a deal to make sense.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's a risk Alice might walk away, but the potential reward of getting the price closer to $10,000 is worth the calculated risk at this stage."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, I've found a similar product for $10,000. I'm still very interested in yours, but I need to be realistic about my budget. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Introducing Competition:** By mentioning the offer from John (without revealing his name), you create a sense of urgency and competition for Alice.
* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer effectively becomes your ""take-it-or-leave-it"" price. You're clearly signaling that you're willing to walk away if Alice doesn't meet your target.
* **Strong Position:** You're now in a strong position. Alice knows you have a viable alternative and that you're serious about your budget constraints."
