"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $8,000. Let me know if that works for you.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need to make this work. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go down to $11,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. To be honest, I've found a similar product for $10,000. I'm still very interested in yours, but I need to be realistic about my budget. If you're able to meet that price, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
