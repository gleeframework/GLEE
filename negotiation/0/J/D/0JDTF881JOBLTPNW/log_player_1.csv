"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $18,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This offer reflects a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your persistence. I understand where you're coming from on price.  How about we split the difference and settle at $15,250? I think that's a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 15250}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise again. However, $15,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

While I could continue negotiating, Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $13,500 is a reasonable profit above my minimum, and it avoids the risk of him walking away entirely."
