Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. This gives me the best chance of maximizing my profit. If he rejects, I can then explore other options, like selling to John or negotiating further with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price of $11,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it's a more reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm willing to accept it.  While it's not ideal, it's a good deal considering I could potentially get a better price in the next round, but there's also a chance of a further price reduction.  Selling to John would ensure $12,000, but the risk of a better deal in the next round is too tempting."
