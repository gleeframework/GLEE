{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting very close to your limit, and we only have two rounds left.  This counteroffer is a significant increase, but it still keeps the price slightly lower than her offer.  It's a calculated risk, aiming to push for a final deal within your budget.  If she rejects, buying from John might be your best option, but you're trying to get the best possible price."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final round of negotiation with Alice, and her offer is now at your maximum budget.  While there is a small possibility that Alice could accept a lower price, the risk of not closing a deal outweighs the potential savings. Buying from John for $12,000 is the most sensible option to ensure you get the product."
