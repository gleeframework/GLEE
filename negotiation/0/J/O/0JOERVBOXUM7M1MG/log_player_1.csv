Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to try to get a better price.  I know the product is worth more to Bob, so I'll try a counteroffer."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and it's likely that we'll continue to haggle if I reject it again.  It's best to secure the sale now."
