"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm open to offers, but I know it's worth at least $80 to me. What would you be willing to pay for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good deal, it's still above your desired price point of $150.  You have room to negotiate and should attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still shows you're serious about buying the product."
