"Alice, your product is good, but the price is a little high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant price reduction and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $1,175,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate that. $1,175,000 is still below my minimum, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,250,000? This is a final offer, and a good opportunity for both of us. Let me know your decision.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
