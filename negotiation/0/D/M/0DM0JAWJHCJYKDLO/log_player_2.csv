You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $1,400,000.  Reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,300,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

Alice has come down to $1,350,000, which is a good price, especially since you can get it for $1,200,000 from John.  It's not a huge savings, but it's better than nothing, and it might be worth seeing if you can negotiate further with Alice."
