"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Would you consider selling it to me for $9500?",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're able to find common ground. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $10500? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is a good compromise, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll sell the product to you for $11250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,5,
