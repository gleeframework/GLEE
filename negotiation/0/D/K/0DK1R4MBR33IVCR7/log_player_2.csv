"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  You're aiming to get the product for under $10,000. Alice's offer is too high. It makes sense to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's price ($12,000) shows your willingness to negotiate and provides room for compromise. A $9,000 offer is still within your budget and leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer that might be acceptable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your target of $10,000.  It's worth rejecting and continuing to negotiate. You've already lowered the price from $12,000, and Alice is showing a willingness to compromise.  A counteroffer from you might bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Since Alice is willing to come down to $11,000, it seems like a reasonable middle ground would be $9,500. This shows a continued commitment to negotiation while still aiming for a price lower than $10,000.  It leaves room for a possible compromise if Alice is still willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above your target price of $10,000. It's worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price. You've already lowered the price from $12,000 down to $10,500, and Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. A counteroffer from you might bring the price down to your target or very close."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is clearly willing to compromise, as seen by her offer of $10,500. This is a good opportunity to make a final counteroffer at your target price of $10,000.  At this point, Alice has two options: accept and sell at your target, or reject and risk you going to John."
