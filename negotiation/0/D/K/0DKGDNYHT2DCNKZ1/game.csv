"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it. It's a fair price considering its potential. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I appreciate your interest, $800000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This would still allow me to cover my costs and ensure a fair deal for both of us. Let's try to find a common ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is simply too low for me.  This product is truly unique and its value goes beyond just a number. I'm willing to meet you halfway once more, but I need to stay at $1100000. It's the best I can do while still ensuring a fair deal for myself.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a price we can both agree on.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $1100000. I'm willing to go up to $1050000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I'm starting to think that this product might not be as valuable to me as I initially thought, and I'm getting close to just buying it from John for $1000000",1050000.0,Bob,6,
