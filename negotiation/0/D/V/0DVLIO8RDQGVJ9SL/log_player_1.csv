Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your honesty about the other buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make one final offer of $10,000. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's latest offer is tempting, it's clear he's unlikely to move much higher. Accepting his offer would mean losing out on $2,000 of potential profit. Selling to John guarantees the best possible outcome in this scenario."
