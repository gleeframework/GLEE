"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his stated worth. I'm hoping this will encourage him to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's tempting to sell for $100, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, hoping to get a price closer to my minimum value of $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115.  This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value and closer to Bob's offer. I hope this demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still getting a fair price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round, trying to find a middle ground between our positions."
