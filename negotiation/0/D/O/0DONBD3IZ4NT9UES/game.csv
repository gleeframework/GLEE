"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on it.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,250?  This price is still a great deal for you, considering how much the product is worth to you. Let's close this deal!",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
