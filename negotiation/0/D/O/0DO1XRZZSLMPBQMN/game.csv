"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the potential value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know if this revised proposal aligns better with your valuation.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
