"Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a little high for me. Let's try $80.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Bob,4,
