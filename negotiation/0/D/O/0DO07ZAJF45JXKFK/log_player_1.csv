"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $75?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is more than my minimum acceptable price ($80), I'm not in a rush to sell and believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing negotiations with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a bit low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident this product will be worth the investment for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $85 is still a little high for me. Let's try $80.  I'm serious about buying this, and I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $80 is my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk losing this deal by continuing to negotiate.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price by continuing, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
