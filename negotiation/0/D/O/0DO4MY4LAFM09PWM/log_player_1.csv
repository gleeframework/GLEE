"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I believe the product is worth closer to my initial offer, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true value of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $875,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is consistently trying to meet in the middle, which is a reasonable negotiation tactic. However, we're still significantly above our minimum sale price. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can secure a higher amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for both of us. Let's aim for a win-win. How about we settle at $900,000?  This price reflects the value of the product while acknowledging your initial offer."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has twice offered to ""meet in the middle."" By round 5, it's strategically smart to signal a willingness to compromise by accepting his previous offer. This shows flexibility and aims to close the deal quickly at a price still significantly above the minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we could push for more, Bob is clearly demonstrating that he has a budget ceiling. Accepting $880,000 is a significant profit margin above our $800,000 minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away completely. It's a strong win in a negotiation to secure a deal quickly and efficiently."
