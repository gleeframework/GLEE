``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping he'll be willing to pay a little extra to secure it.  I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, which will give me some leverage during negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only able to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While I'm happy with $10,000, I think I can potentially get a little more from Bob. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $10,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I think it's still a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still unable to go above $10,000 for the product. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price,  $10,250 is still a good deal and it's likely I won't be able to get more from Bob.  It's better to take the deal than risk him walking away completely."
