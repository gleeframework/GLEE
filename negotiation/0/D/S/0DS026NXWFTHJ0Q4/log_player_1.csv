"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly lower than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still maximizing my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get even closer to the value I have in mind. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is a decent price, I can likely do better.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue negotiating and potentially secure a price closer to my initial target of $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $13,000 to make this work.  Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $12,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not willing to accept it.  I believe I can push for a better deal, and I'm not yet at a point where I would consider selling to John for $10,000.  I'll continue the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500 as a final compromise.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're willing to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $13,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and the price is getting closer to my desired price.  While I could try to push for $13,500, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with only the $10,000 offer from John.  Accepting $13,250 is a good compromise that secures a good deal for me without risking a lower price."
