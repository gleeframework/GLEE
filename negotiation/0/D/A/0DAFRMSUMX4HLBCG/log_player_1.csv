Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth at least $100 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $125.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation, but still lower than the product's value to Bob. It shows I'm willing to compromise while also aiming for a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $125 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $100 is my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $125 by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While I understand $100 is your limit, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about $115?  This would give me a little more breathing room, and still be a good deal for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $107? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $107 is closer to my desired price of $125 than my minimum of $100.  It's a reasonable compromise that allows me to earn more than selling to John."
