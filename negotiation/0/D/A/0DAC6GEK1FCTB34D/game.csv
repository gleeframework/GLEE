"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  It's still a good deal for both of us. Let's try to finalize this, I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,3,
