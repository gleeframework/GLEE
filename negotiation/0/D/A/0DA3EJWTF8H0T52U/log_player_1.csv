Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the market value and I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.

Bob is unlikely to budge from his $850,000 offer and I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John at this point."
