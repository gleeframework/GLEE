"Alice, I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Given my understanding of the market, I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. It's a fair price considering the market value and I'm confident this is a win-win situation for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,
