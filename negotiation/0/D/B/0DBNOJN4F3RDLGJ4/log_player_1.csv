Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $10,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so I need to offer a price lower than his perceived value to make it attractive.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $9,500 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John at my minimum price.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
