"Bob, I'm offering you my product for a price that's fair for both of us. I know it's worth a lot to you, but I also need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000.  This gives you a significant savings while ensuring I get a fair price. Let me know your thoughts!",12000.0,Alice,1,
