# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.  However, if you decide to decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1,200,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.
