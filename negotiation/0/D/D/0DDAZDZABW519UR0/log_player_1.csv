"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price accurately reflects the significant returns you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This allows room for negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $2,200,000, we set a high anchor. Even if Bob rejects this offer, his counteroffers are likely to be influenced by this initial high number, potentially landing closer to my target.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's value and potential return on investment helps justify the high initial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant jump from his perceived value, it's still considerably below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to give away the product.  I'll use the next round to try and steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, the value this product brings is truly substantial. I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $2,000,000.  This is a fair offer considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Meeting Bob ""halfway"" is a strong negotiating tactic, even though the reduction from my initial offer might seem large. It shows willingness to make a deal while still reinforcing the product's value.
* **Psychological Price Point:**  $2,000,000 is a clean, round number. These often have a psychological impact and can make the offer seem more appealing.
* **Focus on Value:**  I continue to emphasize the long-term benefits and value proposition rather than just the price itself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,900,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still in a range where I believe I can negotiate a better deal.  Selling to John is becoming a more appealing backup plan as the rounds progress, but I'm not ready to concede just yet. I'll make another counteroffer to test Bob's willingness to move closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about getting this deal done, I'm willing to come down to $1,975,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's more than fair given the value you're receiving."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  I'm making a smaller concession this time ($25,000) to signal that my price is firming up.
* **Final Offer Tactic:** Introducing a sense of urgency with the ""final offer"" can push Bob to make a decision.
* **Justification:** I'm subtly shifting from focusing on his potential gains to emphasizing the fairness of my offer from my perspective. This is a classic negotiation tactic to create a sense that I'm reaching my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I'm getting close to your price, but I still think it's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,950,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to my psychological threshold. While I could likely push him a little further, the gains would be minimal and risk losing the deal entirely.  $1,950,000 is a strong return, and accepting now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
