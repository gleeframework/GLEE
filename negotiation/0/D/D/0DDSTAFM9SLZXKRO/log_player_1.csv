"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $115, which is close to my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm being friendly and optimistic to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while also leaving room for negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied with the initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $90 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120, and even below the value Bob himself places on the product ($100). Accepting it would be a major loss.
* **Negotiation potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it shows he is interested. Rejecting it opens the door for further negotiation. 
* **John is an option:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $120 provides a safety net. I can be more firm with Bob without worrying about losing out entirely. 

**Next Round Strategy:**  I will counter with a price closer to $100, but still above Bob's offer.  The goal is to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $105. This still gives me a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for you too. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer, but still significantly above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still protecting my interests.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth $100 to him, making $105 a fair price.
* **Positive language:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make the negotiation feel more collaborative. 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground and potentially secure a deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $97? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $97 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still not enough.
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is clearly interested and has shown he's willing to move towards my price. This suggests further negotiation could be productive.
* **John's offer is still an option:** I have a safety net with John's offer, allowing me to be more assertive in negotiations without risking a loss.

**Next Round Strategy:** I will counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still above Bob's offer.  The goal is to continue closing the gap and find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $97.  I'm still looking for a bit more, though. How about $101? It's a good deal for both of us, and it's just a small step closer to where we need to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 101}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:**  I'm making a small concession by dropping from $105 to $101, showing I'm willing to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""good deal"" for both of us, making it seem like a win-win situation.
* **Focus on proximity:** I'm highlighting that $101 is ""just a small step closer"" to where Bob wants to be, making it feel more achievable for him.

This strategy aims to  close the gap further and potentially reach a deal in this round. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be prepared to make another small concession in the next round, but I will keep John's offer in mind as a backup."
