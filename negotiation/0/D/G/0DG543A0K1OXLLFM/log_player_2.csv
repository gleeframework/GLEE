"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and rejecting the offer allows him to potentially get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price as close to his maximum budget of $1,200,000 as possible. Starting with a counteroffer of $1,250,000 is a reasonable starting point. This leaves some room for negotiation while still being a significant discount from Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's closer to Bob's desired price, but there's still potential to negotiate further.  Rejecting this offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now getting closer to his maximum budget.  By offering $1,300,000, he's showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product but also wants to find a middle ground. This counteroffer is a compromise, increasing the offer from the previous round while still staying within a reasonable range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is now above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that Bob is willing to accept.  It's more advantageous for Bob to purchase the product from John at $1,200,000, as this ensures he gets the product within his budget."
