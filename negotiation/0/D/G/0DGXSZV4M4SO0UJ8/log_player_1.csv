"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  How about we start with $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's offer immediately. Although his offer is already equal to the value of selling to John, I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob. There's no guarantee I can get a higher price, but it's worth exploring for a few more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $10,000 is a good starting point, it's a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product for you. Let's see if we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer for now. While it's getting closer to what I want, I'm still hoping to get at least $12,000. I'll make another counteroffer and see if I can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still not quite there at $11,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?  This would give us both a fair deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $11500 is still outside my budget. How about we meet at $11250?  That's a small increase from my last offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $11,250 is close enough to my desired price point. While I could try to push for a bit more, we're nearing the end of the negotiation, and I'm not confident I can achieve a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a good return and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether."
