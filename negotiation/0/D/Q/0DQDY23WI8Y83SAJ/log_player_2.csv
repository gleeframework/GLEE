Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests. What do you think?

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $825,000. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $800,000 and avoid further negotiation."
