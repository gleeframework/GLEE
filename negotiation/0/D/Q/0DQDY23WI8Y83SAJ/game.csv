"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, as it's still above my minimum value of $800,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get as close to your target as possible. However, I'm still not willing to go below $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to prioritize my own interests.
