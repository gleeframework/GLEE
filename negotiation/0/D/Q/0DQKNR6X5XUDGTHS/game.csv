"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $11,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $9,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's make this work. How about $9,750? That's my final offer and a very competitive price for what you're getting.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, I am serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me. $9,750 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle at $9,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",9500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be firm on this. I can do $9,600, but that's my absolute bottom line.",9600.0,Alice,7,
