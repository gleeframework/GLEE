"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm initially proposing a price of $11,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting price is too high. It leaves little room for negotiation and is already close to your maximum budget. It's worth seeing if she's willing to come down significantly in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if we can settle on a price closer to $9,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Signals Serious Interest:**  By stating a specific price and expressing continued interest, we show Alice that we're serious about buying but need a more appealing price point.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that John's offer of $12,000 is our fallback plan. As the rounds progress, we'll need to adjust our strategy based on Alice's responses and how much closer we get to our 10-round limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $11,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $10,000? This would represent a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is moving in the right direction, but it's still too slow. A $1,000 reduction isn't enough to warrant accepting yet. We'll continue to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you consider $9,250?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 9250
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($10,000) and our previous counteroffer ($9,000) to show a willingness to move closer to her price. 
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By sticking firmly to our desired price range, we're letting Alice know we're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have six rounds left. While there's still time, we should start considering slightly larger concessions if she doesn't budge much in the next round or two."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you're clearly serious about this product and I respect that. Let's make this work. How about $9,750? That's my final offer and a very competitive price for what you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Alice is likely using a common negotiation tactic by stating this is her ""final offer"" to try and pressure you. Don't let this sway you. We're still not in our desired price range.
* **Small Concession:** Her price reduction of $250 is minor. We still have room to negotiate a better price.
* **Time Remaining:** With five rounds left, we have time for a couple more counteroffers, even if it means accepting a slightly less ideal outcome than our initial target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, I am serious about this product, and I appreciate you working with me. $9,750 is close, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Could we settle at $9,500? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  We start by recognizing Alice's efforts, building goodwill for the final stages of the negotiation.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm on getting closer to our target price, but the offer isn't unreasonably low given the negotiation history. 
* **Time Pressure:**  We're getting close to the halfway point. Offering $9,500 now increases the chance of a deal while leaving us some wiggle room if needed in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I've tried to be flexible, but I need to be firm on this. I can do $9,600, but that's my absolute bottom line. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:**  Alice has now used ""final offer"" twice and emphasized her ""absolute bottom line."" It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Acceptable Price:**  $9,600 is a good deal, saving you $2,400 compared to John's offer and $400 off your ideal target.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only three rounds left, continuing to push for a slightly lower price carries the risk of Alice walking away, leaving you to purchase from John at a higher cost."
