{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation with a price that is slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, leaving room for potential compromise. I'm also being friendly and positive, hoping to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I understand its value to you, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little to $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, could we possibly agree on a price of $8,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. It's a good deal for both of us, and there's no need to risk a further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a deal falling through."
