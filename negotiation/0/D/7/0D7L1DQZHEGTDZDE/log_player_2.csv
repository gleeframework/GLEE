Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a much lower price.  This is a bold move that might be rejected, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation.  The target price is still within Bob's budget, but also significantly below Alice's perceived value."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for improvement. Bob wants to keep negotiating to potentially secure an even lower price.  The potential savings are still significant compared to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering a price that is in the middle of his previous offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that he is serious about closing the deal.  This price is still very attractive to Bob, and it's possible that Alice might accept it, given she's already moved closer to Bob's target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has a few things to consider:

* **Time:**  The deal could fall through if Bob keeps rejecting offers, and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Progress:** While Alice has moved closer to Bob's target price, there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate. 
* **Savings:**  $1,325,000 is a good deal for Bob, saving him a substantial amount compared to buying from John.

While there might be a small chance to negotiate further, accepting the offer is the most logical choice. It secures the product at a good price and reduces the risk of running out of time or a breakdown in negotiations."
