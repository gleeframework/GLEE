Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I've considered your offer, and while I appreciate your persistence,  $750000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. My absolute final offer is $900000. This price reflects the significant value of the product and allows for a healthy margin for you. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If you are not able to accept this offer, I will unfortunately have to move forward with another buyer who has already expressed interest at my minimum asking price.
