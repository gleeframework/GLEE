"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let's see if we can work something out."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $10,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high. I'm happy to go to $9,000.  This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,750? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice has come down significantly in price, $9,750 is still above Bob's ideal price point of $8,000.  Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, it's the best choice to avoid overspending."
