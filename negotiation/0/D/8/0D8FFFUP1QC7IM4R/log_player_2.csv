"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $9,500 is a good price, it's still possible to get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount.  Offering $8,500 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still above Alice's minimum value of $10,000, but significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This establishes that Bob is serious about getting a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,800 is closer to Bob's desired price point, there's still room for negotiation.  Alice is willing to lower the price, suggesting she may be open to a better deal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly, demonstrating that he's willing to compromise. However, he's staying below Alice's last offer, showing that he's still actively negotiating.  $9,000 is a good middle ground and increases the chances of Alice accepting the counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price again, and this offer is very close to Bob's desired price range.  While there's still room to negotiate, the potential for a better deal is getting smaller. Given the limited number of rounds remaining, it's more beneficial for Bob to accept this offer and secure the product at a good price.  Rejecting the offer could lead to further negotiation, but there's no guarantee Alice will lower the price further, and Bob risks having to buy from John at a higher price."
