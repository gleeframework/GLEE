"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's a good chunk below what the product is worth to Bob, but still significantly higher than my minimum. This should incentivize Bob to negotiate but also give me room to maneuver in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I want to see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still a significant margin above Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to compromise and move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,300,000 is tempting, it's still a bit below my ideal. I'm going to see if I can push for a bit more, as we're halfway through the negotiation and John is always a possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

I'm offering a slightly lower price than my previous counteroffer, but it's still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will signal that I'm willing to be flexible while still aiming for a price closer to my desired amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Bob's offer is just $80,000 below my minimum, I'm still going to reject it.  There are a couple of reasons:

* **We're nearing the middle of the negotiation:** I have a few more rounds to work with, and with John as a backup, I don't need to settle just yet.
* **I think I can still get more:** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round.

I'll make a counteroffer, but I'll need to be careful not to get too greedy.  I want to keep Bob engaged, but I also want to get as close to my ideal price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1325000} 
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still higher than Bob's.  It's a small compromise that signals my willingness to negotiate, but I'm hoping Bob will meet me halfway and close the deal.  This feels like a good point to solidify the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell to John. 

While Bob's offer is tempting, we're getting close to the end of the negotiation and I don't want to risk running out of time and getting nothing. John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum price, and it's better to secure that than to gamble on Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
