# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

It's always worth trying to negotiate a better price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.

You're still saving $150,000 by going with Alice's offer, but there's a chance you can get it for even less.  Let's see if we can get closer to your target price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000.

You've already managed to save $125,000 compared to John's price. While you might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's likely that Alice is holding firm at this price.  It's time to lock in the deal before you risk losing the opportunity."
