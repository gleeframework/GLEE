"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into acquiring it.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about $1,025,000?  It's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,025,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my initial asking price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
