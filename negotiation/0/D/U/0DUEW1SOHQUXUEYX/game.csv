"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $9,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,500. Would that work for you?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $7,500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and meet you at $8,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
