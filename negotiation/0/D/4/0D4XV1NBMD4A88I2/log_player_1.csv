{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with great potential. I believe it's a fair price, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room to potentially lower it if needed. It also emphasizes the product's value and the potential for negotiation, encouraging Bob to engage in a dialogue. Remember, you have the option to switch to John at any point if you feel the negotiation with Bob is not going in your favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum value of $800,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, $750,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $850000, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $800,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, it seems unlikely that we'll reach an agreeable price.  John is a guaranteed buyer for $800,000, which is a much safer option at this point."
