"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it for a fair price. How about $100?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $100 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the value of the product to Bob helps him understand the potential benefit of the deal.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""How about $100?"" keeps the conversation open and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for negotiation:** Bob's offer of $90 is still higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but it's closer to my starting point. I believe there's still room to increase the price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. This shows him that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a mutually beneficial price. 
* **Staying above minimum:** While I could sell to John for $80, I want to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob.  There's still time to reach an agreement within my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a middle ground. How about $95? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer, but not too drastically. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a good profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:**  Again, I emphasize the value of the product to Bob. This helps him justify the price in his mind. 
* **Keeping the conversation open:**  Asking ""How about $95?"" encourages Bob to continue the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $95, so how about $92.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:** $92.5 is very close to my desired price point and significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **Limited time:**  We're already on round 4, and the negotiation process is becoming longer.  Accepting the offer ensures a good outcome without risking a further reduction.
* **Minimizing risk:**  While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that Bob will walk away or that I'll end up accepting an even lower price in later rounds. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  The potential gain from further negotiation is outweighed by the risk of losing a sale entirely.  $92.5 is a strong outcome and secures a significant profit."
