"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value to the right person is immeasurable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  Since Bob's maximum budget is $1,200,000,  there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $1,100,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price point. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better price, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. What if we settle on $1,090,000?  That's a small adjustment on my end, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While $1,090,000 is still more than Bob's ideal price, it's closer to his budget than the current price from John. This seems like a fair compromise that allows Bob to secure the product at a reasonable price. Accepting the offer is the best option at this point."
