"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Its value to the right person is immeasurable. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) to aim for a quick and profitable sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial price leaves space for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($1,000,000).
* **Emphasizing Value:** Highlighting the product's ""immeasurable"" value to the right person aims to justify the high price and pique Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe I can negotiate a better price. I'm willing to engage in further counteroffers to try and reach a more favorable outcome.  I'm not willing to accept his current offer, nor am I ready to settle for John's $1,000,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding Slightly:** I'm moving towards Bob's offer by a noticeable amount to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not dropping my price too drastically.  The $1,100,000 price point represents a substantial profit for me and remains closer to my initial offer than Bob's.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a ""meeting in the middle"" approach aims to portray fairness and encourage Bob to move closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offers, showing he's willing to pay a higher price. I'm still holding out for a better deal, aiming to secure at least $1,090,000 if possible.  With several rounds remaining, I'm not feeling pressured to accept or settle for John's offer just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. What if we settle on $1,090,000?  That's a small adjustment on my end, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1090000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Flexibility:**  Acknowledging Bob's seriousness and suggesting we ""find a number we both agree on"" aims to build rapport and signal a willingness to finalize the deal.
* **Slight Concession:**  I'm reducing my ask slightly, but holding firm at $1,090,000. This demonstrates continued negotiation but with a clear bottom line in mind.
* **Framing as a Win-Win:**  Presenting this price as ""fair for both of us"" encourages Bob to see it as a balanced agreement rather than a loss on his end."
