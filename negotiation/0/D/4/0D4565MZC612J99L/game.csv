,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given my budget and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,050,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Let's try $1,075,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. What if we settle on $1,090,000?  That's a small adjustment on my end, but I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
