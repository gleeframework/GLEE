"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $150.",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $110? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $95? That would be great.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.",105.0,Alice,5,
