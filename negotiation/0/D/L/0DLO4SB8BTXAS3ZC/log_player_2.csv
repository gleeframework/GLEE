Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $95 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? I think it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a deal.

You have three options:

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100.  It's better to secure the product from John at the known $100 price."
