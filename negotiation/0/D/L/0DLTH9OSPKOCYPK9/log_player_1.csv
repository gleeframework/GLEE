Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 175
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to $175 as possible.  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, there's potential to earn more from Bob.
* **Starting High:** This offer starts above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also establishes a strong initial point.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  Bob might try to negotiate the price down. I need to be prepared to counter-offer strategically, always keeping my minimum price of $150 in mind.
* **Alternative Outcomes:** If Bob rejects my initial offer, I can propose a lower price, getting closer to his $100 valuation while staying above my own minimum. However, each counter-offer increases the risk of losing him as a buyer."
