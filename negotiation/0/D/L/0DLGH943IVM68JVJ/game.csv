"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  How about $105?  That's still a fair price for you, and it's within my budget.",105.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $108? It's still a great price for you, and it's closer to my original offer.",108.0,Alice,3,
