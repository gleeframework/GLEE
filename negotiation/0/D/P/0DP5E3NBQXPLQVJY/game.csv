"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $14500, but I'd like to add a small premium for the hassle of negotiating. How about $14800?

"I appreciate your final offer, but I'm afraid I'm going to have to pass. I'm willing to walk away and buy the product from John for $10000. I think that's a much better deal for me. Thank you for your time, Alice!",10000.0,Bob,10,
