"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm thinking of a price of $12000 for it.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Could you consider a price like that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11000. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $11000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10500. Could you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, $10500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $11000, which would be $10750. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $10500 again. Could you consider that?",10500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go back to $10500. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",11200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $11200. I'm willing to go up to $10800. Could you consider that?",10800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to give up yet, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I can meet you at $11500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, Alice, but $11500 is still too high for me. I've gone as high as I can. I think we've reached the end of the road. I'm going to have to walk away and consider buying from John for $15000.",0.0,Bob,10,
