Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price slightly. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth and justifying a price higher than $12,000.
* **Alternative Option:**  Hinting that you'll list it publicly creates a sense of urgency and implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act quickly. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still offering Bob a price he might find reasonable considering the product's value."
