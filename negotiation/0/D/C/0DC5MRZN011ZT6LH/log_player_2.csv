"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than her value:** Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000, but is offering it for $1,200,000. This indicates room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy the product from John for $1,500,000, which is a higher price, but still within your budget. This gives you leverage.

By rejecting the offer, you can attempt to negotiate a lower price with Alice, aiming to get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:** We're aiming to split the difference between Alice's value and her offer. Since she's willing to sell for $1,000,000 and offered $1,200,000, a starting point of $1,100,000 seems reasonable.
* **Keeping John in mind:** We need to be mindful of the fact that John will sell for $1,500,000. This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation while still being significantly cheaper than John's price.

By offering $1,100,000, we're showing Alice that we're serious about buying, but also indicating that we're willing to walk away if she's not willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is moving in the wrong direction:** Alice's counteroffer increased to $1,300,000, which is worse than her initial offer. This shows she is not as willing to compromise as we thought.
* **John is still a better option:** Even though Alice's price is closer to our goal, John's offer of $1,500,000 is still within our budget and provides a safer alternative.

By rejecting again, we're forcing Alice to consider her position. She might be willing to lower her price further to avoid losing the deal altogether. It's a risky strategy, but potentially worth it to see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're trying to find a middle ground between our previous offer of $1,100,000 and Alice's latest offer of $1,300,000. 
* **John's offer:** We're still mindful of John's offer of $1,500,000, ensuring that our counteroffer remains significantly cheaper.

By offering $1,150,000, we're showing Alice that we're willing to negotiate, but also that we're not willing to overpay. This counteroffer is a strong position for the next round of negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting worse:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,400,000 is even higher than her initial offer, and is now closer to John's price.
* **No further negotiation:** There is no indication that Alice will lower her price further, especially with John's offer as a benchmark.
* **John's offer is the best option:** We are better off buying from John at $1,500,000 rather than continuing to negotiate with Alice.

Given that Alice seems inflexible and John's offer is within our budget, it's time to cut our losses and move on."
