"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,050,000? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're getting closer to your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $1,025,000? It's the highest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
