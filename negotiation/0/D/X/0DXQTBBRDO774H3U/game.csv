"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's find a mutually beneficial solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,050,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
