"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,100,000. This price is still within the value you've placed on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
