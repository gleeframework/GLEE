"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $20,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $15,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first, as he might be able to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 is a little too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $17,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $17,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the product from John for a lower price. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, as he might be able to get a lower price than $17,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $17,500 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $16,000.  This is a fair price, considering I can get the product from someone else for $15,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 16000}
