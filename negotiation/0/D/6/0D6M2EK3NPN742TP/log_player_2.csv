"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product, which is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,000,000). This means you can save $100,000 by accepting Alice's offer compared to buying from John."
