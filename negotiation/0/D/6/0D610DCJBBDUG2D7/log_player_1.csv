"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $9,000. It's slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate while still leaving me a profit.  This should encourage him to counter-offer, giving us a chance to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I have a few rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and try to push for something closer to $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,800.  This is a small step closer to my initial offer, and still within a reasonable range for Bob.  I hope this will incentivize him to compromise and accept a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,200 is better than selling to John, I'm not willing to go that low yet. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I still have a few rounds to try and get closer to my desired price. I'll reject his offer and try to find a compromise somewhere between $8,200 and my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8600}
```

I'm going to counter with $8,600.  This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still leaves me with a decent profit.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot for Bob and he'll be willing to close the deal.  We're getting close to the end of the rounds, so I need to find a solution quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out hope for a better price. Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and I have a few rounds left to try and get closer to my desired price.  I'll reject his offer and try to find a compromise somewhere between $8,200 and my last offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8400} 
```

We are nearing the end of our negotiations, and I need to make a decision. I am willing to lower my price again to $8,400.  This is a significant compromise, but it's still more than I would receive by selling to John. I hope this will be acceptable to Bob, as we only have a few rounds left to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I need to be realistic. Bob's offer of $8,150 is only $150 less than what John would pay, and I don't have the time to risk getting a lower offer.  I'll accept his offer to secure the sale and avoid any further losses."
