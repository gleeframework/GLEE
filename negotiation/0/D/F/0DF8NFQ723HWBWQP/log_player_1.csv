Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum price. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."

Round 3

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise a bit. Let's meet in the middle at $850,000.  I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $800000.  This is my final offer, and it reflects the value I see in your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I would prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price and it's better than selling to John for the same price."
