Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer of $10,000 as my fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $12000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and I respect your valuation of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose $12000 as a final offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum threshold, and there's a good chance he won't budge further. Accepting his offer ensures I get a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation that might lead to a lower price or a rejection altogether."
