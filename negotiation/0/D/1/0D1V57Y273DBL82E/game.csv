"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and above my minimum price. Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking of something more like $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and go with $1,150,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm going to make a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress. I appreciate your final offer of $1,050,000, but I need to remain closer to my initial price point.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This offer is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a win-win situation for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
