"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.  What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $2,200,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,700,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While $2,200,000 represents the true value I see in this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise for both of us. What do you say?",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to offer $1,800,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value we both see in the product.  Let's close this deal.",1800000.0,Bob,4,
