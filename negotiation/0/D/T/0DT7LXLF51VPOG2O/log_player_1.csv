Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than $8,000, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'm not going to sell to John yet, as it is still possible to reach an agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I'm aiming for a price closer to $11,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10000 is a more reasonable price. Can you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial target of $12,000,  $10,000 is a significant improvement over the $8,000 I would get from John. It's a good compromise and a decent return on the product."
