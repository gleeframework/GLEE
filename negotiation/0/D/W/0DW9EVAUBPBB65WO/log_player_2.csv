"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our flagship product to you. It is an exceptional opportunity that I believe will greatly benefit your business. I am offering this valuable asset to you for $1,500,000. This price reflects its true worth and includes all necessary components and services. I look forward to discussing the details with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's always better to try to negotiate a lower price, especially since you have multiple rounds to do so.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start the counter-offer process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,500,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, which reflects its fair market value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
