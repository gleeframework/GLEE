Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and increases the chances of him accepting the deal.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know how much Bob is *willing* to pay, just the maximum value the product holds for him. 
* There's always a chance Bob could reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer guarantees you'll at least make your minimum acceptable price."
