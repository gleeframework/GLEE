"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,500 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,250? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10250.0,Bob,4,
