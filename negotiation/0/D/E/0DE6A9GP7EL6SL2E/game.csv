"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I believe this reflects the true value and potential it holds.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think your initial price is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  However, $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000. I believe this price point represents a fair deal for both of us.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I still think the product is overpriced. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
