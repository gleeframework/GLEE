,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $170?",170.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $170. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $190. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",190.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to consider a price of $180?",180.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $180, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer the product for $185. It's a fair price, considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",185.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $185. Would you be willing to meet me at $182?",182.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product for $187. It's my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",187.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, but I'm still not comfortable with $187. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $182 and $187, which is $185.50. Would you be willing to accept this price?",185.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to accept $185.50, Bob. I think I've compromised enough. I'll offer the product for $188, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",188.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your price, but I'm not willing to go above $182. I think we've gone back and forth enough, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at $182. If not, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",182.0,Bob,10,
