"I understand you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $165 was a good compromise, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. I'm willing to give you a bit more room for negotiation, so I'll offer it to you for $175. Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",175.0,Alice,5,,

"Bob, I understand you're really trying to get to $165, but I've already given you a bit of a discount from my initial offer. I'm not willing to go any lower than $180, and I'm starting to think that's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're still interested, I'd be willing to meet you at $180. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",180.0,Alice,7,,
