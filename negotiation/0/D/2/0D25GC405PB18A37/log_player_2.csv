"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product, but Alice's offer is at the very top of your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no harm in rejecting the first offer and seeing if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting by offering a price that's $1,000 lower than Alice's initial offer.  This is a significant reduction, but it's still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's offer of $12,000. There's no need to risk further negotiation, especially with limited rounds remaining.  It's a good time to close the deal and save some money."
