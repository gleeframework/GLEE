"Bob, I'm excited about the possibility of you acquiring this product. I believe it would be a valuable asset to your operations.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This price reflects a significant discount from its true value to me, but I'm confident it's a fair offer that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us, considering the potential benefits it offers. ",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my expectations. To make this deal work for both of us, I'm willing to drop the price to $1,200,000. This is a significant concession on my part, but it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too far below what I need to make this deal work for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,100,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still more than I can reasonably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
