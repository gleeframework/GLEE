Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and the offer.  While $900,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite meet my expectations.

This is a significant concession on my part, but it reflects my commitment to finding a mutually beneficial solution. What do you think?
