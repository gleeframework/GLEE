{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly higher than my minimum of $800,000, and lower than Bob's maximum of $1,500,000. This gives us both room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price.  I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,100,000?  This is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,050,000? This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is higher than John's offer of $800,000, and it's getting close to my desired price range.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
