Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering this valuable product to you first.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have leverage.  Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Create Urgency:** By mentioning other buyers and a ""limited-time offer,"" you encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid missing out. 
* **Justification:** While not essential, hinting at the product's value (""worth a significant amount"") might make Bob reconsider his own valuation.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $12,000. He might counter-offer, refuse, or walk away.  You'll need to be prepared to negotiate or move on to John if Bob rejects your initial offer."
