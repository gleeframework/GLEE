Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  However, $820,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value and its worth to you. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $880,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.
