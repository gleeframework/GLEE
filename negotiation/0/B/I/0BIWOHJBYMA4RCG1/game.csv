"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're selling. However, I believe we can come to an even better agreement. How about we aim for $820,000? This price reflects a fair compromise considering the value of the product and my budget.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  However, $820,000 is still a bit low considering the product's value and its worth to you. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to go down to $880,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",880000.0,Alice,3,
