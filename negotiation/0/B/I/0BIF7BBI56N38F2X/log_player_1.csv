Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I get at least $50 more than my minimum value.  I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer, so I'm not going to rush into selling to him yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$80 is significantly less than my minimum value of $100. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm countering with $120.  This is still above my minimum value, but it shows I'm willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Bob sees this as a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Although $90 is still less than my initial asking price and my desired profit margin, it's above my minimum value of $100.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potential stalemate, I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
