Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. I'm asking for $950,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to your product's value ($1,000,000) as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price of $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,000,000, so there's no risk of losing money. 

By starting high, you give yourself the best chance to secure a price that maximizes your profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob."
