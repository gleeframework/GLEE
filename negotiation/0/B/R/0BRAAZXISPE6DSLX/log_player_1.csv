"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, considering the product is worth $120 to both of us. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is still above Bob's offer, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm still not willing to go below my minimum price. I'll reject his offer and try to get a better price in the next round.  I'm running out of time, so I need to start thinking about whether selling to John for $120 is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $120.  I'm getting closer to running out of time, and I need to see if Bob is willing to meet me at my minimum. If he doesn't, I might have to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting increasingly unwilling to pay my minimum price.  I've already rejected his offer at $105, and now he's offering $100.  I only have a few rounds left, and I don't think he's going to budge.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $120."
