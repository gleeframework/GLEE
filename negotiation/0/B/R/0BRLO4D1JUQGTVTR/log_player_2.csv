"Round 1

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay $100, but she's asking for $95. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for the product, since it's worth $80 to you.  Let's find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the first round, it's still above what I'm comfortable paying.  I'm hoping to get closer to my $85 counteroffer.  I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $90 is still a little too high for me.  I'm sticking with my offer of $85.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To move forward, I propose we set the price at $88 for the product. This is slightly above your last offer but still below my initial asking price. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you see in the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is only $3 above my counteroffer of $85.  This is a good compromise and a decent price for me, considering it's still below my maximum willingness to pay of $100.  It's time to close the deal."
