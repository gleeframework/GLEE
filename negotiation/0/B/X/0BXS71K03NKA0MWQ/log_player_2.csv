"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is high. While it's below your maximum budget, you know you have a backup option with John for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to:

* **Negotiate a better price:** Alice might be willing to lower her asking price to make the sale.
* **Force a choice:**  By rejecting, you signal that her price isn't ideal. This could lead her to either improve the offer or let you walk away. 

You lose nothing by rejecting this initial offer and stand to potentially save a significant amount of money."
