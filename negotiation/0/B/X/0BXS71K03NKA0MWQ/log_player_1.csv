Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The safety net of John's offer at $800,000 provides leverage. If Bob outright rejects the initial offer, Alice can consider a counter-offer closer to Bob's valuation, knowing she has a guaranteed sale at a lower price."
