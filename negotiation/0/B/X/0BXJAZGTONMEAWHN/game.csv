"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. I'm open to negotiations and willing to meet in the middle. Can you consider my offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I can't go as low as $1,200,000.  How about we meet halfway between our two offers? I propose $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
