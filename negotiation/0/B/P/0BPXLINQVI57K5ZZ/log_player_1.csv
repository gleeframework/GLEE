Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a price of $1500000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm going to try to get a higher price from Bob. I have 9 rounds left and can always sell to John as a backup."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to negotiate, $1,500,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000 to show my commitment to finding common ground. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price than $1,600,000. I have 6 rounds left and can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While $1,600,000 is closer to where I need to be, I'm still a bit short of my target. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,650,000.  This is a fair price that considers both our interests. Let's see if we can find a solution."", ""product_price"": 1650000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued effort to meet in the middle. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my budget and the value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1625000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,625,000 is getting very close to my desired price.  It's a significant improvement over his previous offers and is only $25,000 less than my last counteroffer. I'm confident I won't get a better offer from Bob, and I have fewer rounds left. It's time to accept the offer."
