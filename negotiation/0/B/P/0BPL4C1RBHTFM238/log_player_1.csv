{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know the product is worth a significant amount to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting at $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value ($1,500,000), but it still leaves me with a good profit. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, highlighting the value to Bob. 
* **Strategy:** I'm trying to gauge Bob's interest without giving away too much. This initial offer gives me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1200000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a better offer than Bob's initial rejection, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's counteroffer and see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $950,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Given the value this product holds for you, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still leaves me with a profit, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm coming down from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000. This is a significant concession but still leaves me with a profit much closer to my minimum goal.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer while emphasizing the value of the product to him. I'm also framing it as a compromise to encourage further negotiations.
* **Strategy:** This counteroffer is aimed at finding a middle ground. It's likely Bob will either accept this offer or come back with a counteroffer closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $1000000 for the product. I hope this proposal allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my desired profit margin. It seems like Bob is unwilling to go higher, and the risk of further negotiation with him leading to a lower price outweighs the potential gains.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my desired profit and minimizes the risk of a lower offer."
