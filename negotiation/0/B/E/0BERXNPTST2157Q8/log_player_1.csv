Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the potential benefit for him.
* **Leaving Room:** I'm leaving room to negotiate lower if needed, but still earning significantly more than my minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. The negotiation process can be complex and will depend on Bob's response and my assessment of his potential willingness to pay. I'm prepared to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers and the possibility of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Target Price:**  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by counteroffering. There's still potential for a more favorable deal.
* **John's Offer:** I'm aware of John's offer, which gives me a solid fallback position. 

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer but still above his counteroffer. This will show a willingness to negotiate while maintaining a comfortable position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to go down to $950,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm keeping the price above Bob's initial offer, but still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary.

**Next Step:** I'll closely watch Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects, I'll need to decide whether to counteroffer again or move to John's offer, based on my assessment of Bob's negotiating strategy and my desire to achieve the best possible price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).  
* **Potential for Stalemate:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate, with both of us unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer guarantees me a substantial profit and avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation or a failed deal. 

**Conclusion:**  While it's tempting to try to squeeze a few more dollars from Bob, the potential for a lengthy and uncertain negotiation with an uncertain outcome outweighs the potential gains.  John's offer provides a safe and profitable alternative."
