Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is simply too far from where I'm comfortable. My final offer is $1,200,000. If that doesn't work, I'm afraid I'll have to pursue other options.

While Bob is increasing his offer, it seems unlikely he'll reach my minimum acceptable price.  John offers a sure $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially ending up lower."
