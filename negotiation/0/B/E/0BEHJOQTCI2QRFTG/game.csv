"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this product.  While I recognize its value, $1100000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1050000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $1050000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. I'm willing to offer $1025000.  This is a fair price, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in the product. Let's try to close this deal!",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1025000. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering you the product for $1030000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize the deal at this price. Let me know what you think!",1030000.0,Alice,5,
