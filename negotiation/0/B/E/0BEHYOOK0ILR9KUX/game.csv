"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our ongoing discussions, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum price point. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the value I place on this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value you place on this product, but unfortunately, I am still unable to meet your price. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
