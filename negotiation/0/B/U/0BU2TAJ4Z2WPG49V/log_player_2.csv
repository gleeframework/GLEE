Please let us know if you're interested in discussing further details or if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her ($1,200,000) but still below your maximum budget ($1,500,000). This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
