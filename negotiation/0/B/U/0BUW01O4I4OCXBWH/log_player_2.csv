"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly exceptional. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's always a good idea to see if Alice is willing to come down further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. It's a great starting point.  However, I'm aiming to stay within a budget of $800,000 for this purchase.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $875000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but I'm still hoping to get a better price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate for a few more rounds before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. How about $860,000?  I think this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 860000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to go as low as $860000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $880000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $880,000, which is closer to my target price of $800,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that she will reject further counteroffers and I'll end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000.  Accepting her offer is a good compromise and saves me $120,000."
