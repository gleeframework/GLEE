Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for a substantial profit while leaving room for negotiation.  It's also important to frame it as a fair price, appealing to Bob's self-interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $900,000 is a significant profit, it's still below the product's value to Bob. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows us to potentially get a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $900,000 is a bit too low for me, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a significant profit for you, and a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

$975,000 is a good profit, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get us much higher.  It's also important to consider the risk of Bob walking away entirely, leaving us with the less desirable $800,000 offer from John.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a profitable deal."
