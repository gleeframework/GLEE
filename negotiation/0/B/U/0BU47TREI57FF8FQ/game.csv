"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a bit high for me. I'm more interested in a price closer to $10,000.  What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for working with me on the price, Alice. $14,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. Could you do $11,000? That would be a fair deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product for $13,000. That's the lowest I can go. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
