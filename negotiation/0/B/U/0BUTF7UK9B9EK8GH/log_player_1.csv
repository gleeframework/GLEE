"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a steal considering its value to me.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm opening at a price higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still within a range where negotiation is possible. This gives me room to compromise later on.
* **Strong Message:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to me to emphasize its worth and potentially influence Bob's perception.
* **Leaving the Door Open:** I'm not making this a take-it-or-leave-it offer. I'm inviting Bob to discuss it. 

**Remember:** I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer to what the product is worth to him, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, I have 9 rounds left to potentially secure a higher price with Bob.  

**Next Steps:** 

In the next round, I'll counter with a price that's closer to my desired range but also acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm happy to meet you halfway, $900,000 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the offer to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.

**Remember:**  I still have the option of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is there any room for further negotiation? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $1,000,000 at this point.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Time is Running Out:**  I only have 6 rounds left, and selling to John for $1,000,000 is still a viable option. However, I want to see if I can squeeze out a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my desired range, but still acknowledges Bob's willingness to negotiate.  I need to find a sweet spot that might convince Bob without putting me below my acceptable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we try $1,000,000? This would be a fair compromise that respects both of our needs. It's the absolute minimum I can accept, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my final offer, and it's my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go lower. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I reiterate the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Creating Urgency:** By calling this my ""absolute minimum,"" I'm suggesting that Bob needs to make a decision quickly. 

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 to avoid losing too much time and potential for a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of not securing a deal with Bob is becoming too high.  
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Even though Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Secure Deal with John:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees a profitable outcome and minimizes the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who might not budge on his price. 

It's a tough decision, but securing a guaranteed profit of $1,000,000 is the most logical choice at this point."
