,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $115.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway, but $115 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $112.50.  I'm really hoping to close this deal, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",112.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $112.50. I'm willing to make another concession and sell it to you for $114.",114.0,Alice,5,
