""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $12,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still securing a substantial profit for you. This approach aims to strike a balance between securing the deal and maximizing your earnings. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John's offer ($8,000) if Bob rejects your proposal."
