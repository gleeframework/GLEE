"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I find the price a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $775,000. This is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's worth.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $775,000 is pushing the top end of my budget. I could potentially make $700,000 work. Would that be something you'd consider?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value and the effort I've put into creating it, I'm willing to go down to $725,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close.  I can tell you've put a lot of work into this product, and I respect your position on the price.  If you're willing to settle at $710,000, I'm ready to close the deal today.",710000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to go down to $720,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.",720000.0,Alice,7,
