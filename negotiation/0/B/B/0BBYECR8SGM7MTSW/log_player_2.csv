Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $775,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $710,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to go down to $720,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're reaching the limit:**  Alice is clearly holding firm around this price point.  She's made several concessions, and it's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **Good deal:** $720,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,500,000 price tag.
* **Time is a factor:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push might irritate Alice and risk losing the deal entirely."
