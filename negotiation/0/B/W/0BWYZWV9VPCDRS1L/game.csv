"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $100. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",100.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great price for the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
