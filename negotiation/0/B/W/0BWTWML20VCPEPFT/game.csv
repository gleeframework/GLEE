"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be happy to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's still a great deal for you, and I can live with that price.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm ready to pay $85, which is closer to my budget and hopefully still allows you to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about we settle on $92.50? It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price that works for both of us.",92.5,Alice,5,
