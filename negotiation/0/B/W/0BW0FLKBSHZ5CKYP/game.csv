"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you consider $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit higher than $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $110 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $112.50. It's a great compromise that I think you'll find hard to resist.",112.5,Alice,5,
