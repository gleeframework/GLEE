Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,500. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to make a good profit. I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $15,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's closer to my minimum price of $15,000, I'm still not satisfied with it. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price.  I want to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $13,500. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still above Bob's offer.  I hope this will convince him to come closer to my desired price."
