"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is significantly higher than his $12,000 limit, and he can get the product from John for a lower price.  He should counteroffer Alice in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is a fair price given my needs. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and my initial asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $14,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his limit, and he can get the product from John for a lower price.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice in hopes of getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $12,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $13500. This is a fair compromise considering our previous negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice is willing to come down to $13,500, this is still above Bob's $12,000 limit.  At this point, he has reached the halfway point in negotiations, and it's unlikely Alice will go lower.  It's best to accept the guaranteed lower price from John and avoid further negotiation."
