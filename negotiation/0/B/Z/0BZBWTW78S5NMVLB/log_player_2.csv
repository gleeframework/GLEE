"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $20,000 is far above his budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. Could you consider $16,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $16,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget. Bob should reject and continue to negotiate.  He's already stated his maximum budget, so there's no need to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute maximum is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  While $13,000 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial price, it's still above his budget. Buying from John guarantees him the product at his maximum price point."
