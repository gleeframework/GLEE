"Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you this excellent product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $20,000 is fair.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my price range. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. Could you consider $16,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but my absolute maximum is $10,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product. Let's find a middle ground. How about $13,000? This is my final offer.",13000.0,Alice,5,
