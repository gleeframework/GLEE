"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $600,000. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
