"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10500. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  While it's lower than her initial offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price.  He can reject this offer and make a counteroffer closer to his budget. There's still potential for finding a price that works for both of them."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $8500, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $9800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $9,800 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. While it's a lower price than her initial offer, Bob is better off buying from John, who is willing to sell the product for $8,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks further delays and a potential stalemate, whereas buying from John guarantees a deal within his budget."
