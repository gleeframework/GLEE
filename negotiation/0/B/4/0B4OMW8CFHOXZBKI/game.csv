"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $1,100,000 to sweeten the deal. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable paying $1,100,000.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm prepared to pay $950,000. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
