"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth $1,000,000 to you. I'm willing to make a competitive offer of $1,100,000 to sweeten the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  The counteroffer stage gives Bob a chance to potentially get the product for less than $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable paying $1,100,000.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm prepared to pay $950,000. Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this price."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  Alice's counteroffer of $1,025,000 is still higher than what Bob can get from John, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price.  It's better to secure the product at the lower price from John."
