{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also framing the message to emphasize my willingness to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't settle for a price that undervalues my product.  I'll proceed to the next round and try to get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

This counteroffer is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his range, showing a willingness to compromise. The message emphasizes a fair price for both sides, continuing the tactic of focusing on mutual benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand it's valuable to you, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $7,750?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll proceed to the next round and try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about $8,250?  It's a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```

This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob halfway from my last offer.  I'm emphasizing the word ""reasonable"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.  My goal is to get as close as possible to my desired price without risking a deal with John."
