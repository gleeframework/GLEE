Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is still a bit low for me. How about $8,250?  It's a reasonable compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than her current offer of $8,250.  Since your absolute limit is $8,000 and John is offering the product at that price, it makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice has a diminishing chance of success and might waste time."
