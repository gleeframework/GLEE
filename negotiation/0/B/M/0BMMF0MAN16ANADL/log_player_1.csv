Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset.

Let me know if this is something you're interested in pursuing."", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000.
