"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by counteroffering.  You can always fall back on buying from John for $12,000 if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significant counteroffer of $10,000 sets a strong baseline for negotiation. This is a substantial discount from Alice's initial price, and it signals that you are serious about getting a good deal. This leaves room for potential compromise without immediately jumping to John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you're still trying to save as much as possible.  There's potential for further negotiation. You can still offer a lower price and try to reach a compromise, remembering you have the fallback option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer, but it's closer to a possible middle ground. This increases the likelihood of Alice accepting your offer, while still getting you a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, you're still in a strong position.  You've shown you're willing to negotiate, and Alice is responding by making concessions.  There's still room to get a better deal. The risk of losing the negotiation is outweighed by the potential for further savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant increase from your previous offer, but it's still less than Alice's current offer of $11,200. This demonstrates your commitment to getting a good deal, while also showing a willingness to meet Alice halfway.  You're closer to Alice's price point, increasing the chances of acceptance and securing a good deal before having to resort to buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has now dropped her price to $11,100. This is only $100 more than your last counteroffer, and it's the lowest price she has offered so far.  While you could continue negotiating, the risk of losing the deal and having to pay John $12,000 is increasing.  It's a good time to accept the offer and secure a good deal before any potential complications arise."
