Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm still hopeful I can get a slightly better price. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as there's potential to gain more from Bob."

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet because I believe I can negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
