Round 3
Alice's offer:

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? It's a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
We're getting close, but there's still room to negotiate. Alice is willing to come down, so let's see if we can push for a slightly better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer. I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Would you consider $12,000? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

We are aiming for a price as close to Alice's value ($12,000) as possible. By stating this is our final offer, we increase the pressure for Alice to accept.  If she rejects this, we might have to consider accepting her previous offer of $12,500 in the next round to avoid exceeding our $15,000 limit."
