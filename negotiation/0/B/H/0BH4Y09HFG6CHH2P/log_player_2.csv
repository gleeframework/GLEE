"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
We have plenty of room to negotiate down from Alice's initial offer. Let's see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000} 

This counteroffer provides a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer while still leaving room for further negotiation. It also aims to gauge Alice's willingness to move from her starting price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While closer to a reasonable price, we can still try to negotiate a bit further down before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I understand that we both want a fair deal, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a good compromise between our previous offers."", ""product_price"": 11750}

This counteroffer shows willingness to negotiate while still pushing for a price closer to our target. It demonstrates our interest in closing the deal without completely caving to Alice's counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $11,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $12,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly hesitant to go lower, and this price is within a reasonable range of both our ideal price and John's offer. It's time to accept and close the deal."
