Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, as it's worth much more to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. I am not willing to sell for less than $12,000. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $11,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that we both want a fair deal, Alice. How about we settle at $11,750? That's a good compromise between our previous offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm not yet willing to sell for less than $12,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $11,750 is still below my minimum. Let's try $12,250. This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
