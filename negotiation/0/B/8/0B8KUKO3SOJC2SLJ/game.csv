"Hi Alice, $9,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's try to find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about we settle for $8,250? It's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with that price.",8250.0,Bob,4,
