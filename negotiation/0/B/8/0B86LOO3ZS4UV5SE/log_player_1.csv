Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000. This is a great deal considering its worth to you.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible, maximizing your profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Strong Call to Action:**  The message highlights the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, encouraging Bob to accept.

By starting with a strong offer, you increase the likelihood of Bob accepting a price that's significantly higher than your fallback option of selling to John."
