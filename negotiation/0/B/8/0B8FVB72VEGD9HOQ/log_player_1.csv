"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, it was a pleasure meeting with you and discussing the potential of this product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) and my minimum ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a final price closer to my desired outcome.
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the product's value can subtly influence Bob's perception. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""fair starting point for negotiations"" explicitly signals my willingness to discuss the price further, which can encourage Bob to counter-offer.

By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  His counter-offer will reveal how serious and how informed he is about the product's worth.
2. **Maximize Potential Profit:** Even if I have to come down in price, starting high gives me a cushion to still land above my minimum acceptable price.
3. **Maintain Control:**  Setting the initial price frames the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches my absolute minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  His willingness to jump to $1,500,000 suggests he might be willing to go higher. I'm not in a rush, so I'll aim to extract a bit more value before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems we have a difference in perspective on the true value this product brings. I'm willing to move down a bit, but $1,500,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (Appearing Flexible):** By saying ""meet in the middle,"" I signal a willingness to compromise, which can make Bob more receptive.
* **Strategic Concession:** While $1,750,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, it's still a substantial amount above Bob's offer and my minimum. 
* **Justification:**  I'm subtly reinforcing the product's value by referencing ""the true value this product brings."" This keeps the focus on the potential benefits Bob gains.

This counter-offer aims to:

1.  **Test Bob's Resolve:**  Will he accept this compromise, or is he determined to stay closer to $1,500,000?
2.  **Maintain a Strong Position:** I'm still negotiating from a position of strength, well above my minimum acceptable price. 
3.  **Keep the Negotiation Moving:**  Avoiding a stalemate by offering a concrete counter-proposal keeps the momentum going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,750,000. I'd like to propose a price of $1,600,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored around the $1,600,000 mark.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,750,000, accepting at $1,600,000 is a good outcome for a few reasons:

* **Significant Profit:**  $1,600,000 is still a $100,000 profit above my absolute minimum and a reasonable return.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Prolonging the negotiation might not yield much more. Accepting now puts cash in hand quicker.
* **Risk Mitigation:**  There's always a risk Bob could walk away or significantly lower his offer. Accepting now secures a good deal.

While I could push for more, I believe the potential gains are outweighed by the risks of continuing the negotiation. Accepting $1,600,000 represents a solid win."
