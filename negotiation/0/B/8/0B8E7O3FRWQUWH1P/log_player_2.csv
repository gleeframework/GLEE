"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something you've been looking for, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a special price.  Would you be interested in paying $110 for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $110 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $100 from John.  You're better off rejecting this offer and going with your guaranteed lower price."
