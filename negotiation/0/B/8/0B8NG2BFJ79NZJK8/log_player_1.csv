"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me at this point. I'm prepared to offer $950,000 for it. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $950,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the value this product brings to the table, particularly for someone like you, is undeniable. I'm willing to meet you halfway.
