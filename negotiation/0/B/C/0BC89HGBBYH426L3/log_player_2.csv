Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $16,000 is closer to his budget, it's still more than he's willing to pay. He can try to negotiate further, or buy from John for $15,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16,500. I think this is the lowest price I can accept while still getting a fair value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice has come down slightly in price, but it's still above what Bob is willing to pay. Since John is selling the product for $15,000, which is within Bob's budget, it's the best option at this point."
