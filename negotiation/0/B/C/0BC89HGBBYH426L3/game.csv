"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  If that's not acceptable, I'll have to look elsewhere.",15500.0,Bob,4,
