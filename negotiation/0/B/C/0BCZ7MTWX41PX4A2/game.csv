"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the value you've placed on this product.  However,  $1,200,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  Let's aim for $1,000,000 - that's my absolute maximum.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to purchase the product without going over budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous offer. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair value for the product. I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can meet me in the middle.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
