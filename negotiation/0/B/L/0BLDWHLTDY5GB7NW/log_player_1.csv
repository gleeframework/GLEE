Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to get a good deal.  I'll be willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to give it away for less than it's worth to me!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's more than what the product is worth to me, and it's likely I won't get a better offer."
