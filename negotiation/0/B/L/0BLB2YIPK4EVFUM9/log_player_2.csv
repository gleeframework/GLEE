Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $95.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! However, I was thinking that $105 is a more reasonable price for this product, considering its value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. While it's not your ideal price, it's still lower than John's offer and is getting closer to your goal.  You have limited rounds left, and it's better to secure the product at a decent price than risk losing the deal altogether."
