"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $500,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $1,900,000. This is a more reasonable offer, reflecting the value this product brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  Would you consider $700,000?  That's a significant offer on my part.",700000.0,Bob,4,
