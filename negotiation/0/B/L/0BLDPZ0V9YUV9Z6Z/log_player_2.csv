{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price. $9,500 is a good starting point, but there's potential to save more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see if Alice is willing to come down a bit. I'm still well within my budget, and this should open up the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm still willing to negotiate. While $9,000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm going to try for a bit lower before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round. I believe $8,800 is a fair price, considering it's still a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, and it's not too far from my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly and is now offering a price that is very close to my counteroffer.  It's within my budget and a good deal for me. Accepting this offer saves me money compared to buying from John."
