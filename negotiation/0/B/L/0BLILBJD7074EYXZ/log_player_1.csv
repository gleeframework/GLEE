Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm not satisfied with Bob's counter-offer, as it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob is making progress,  I'm getting close to my 10 round limit, and I'm not sure I can get him to go higher. It's a better deal to sell to John at this point, even though it's slightly less than my initial target."
