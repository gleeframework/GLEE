"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's still well above the value you've placed on the product. Let's make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
