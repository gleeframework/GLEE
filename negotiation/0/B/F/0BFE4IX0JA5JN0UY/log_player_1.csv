Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $11,000 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below my minimum value:**  I value the product at $12,000, so I'm still making a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:**  The message is friendly and straightforward, setting the stage for a productive conversation. 

I'll be ready to negotiate further if Bob rejects my initial offer or makes a counteroffer.  I also have the option to go with John's offer of $12,000 at any point if the negotiation with Bob stalls or doesn't seem promising."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum value of $12,000. Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.  

Instead, I'll reject his counteroffer and proceed to the next round.  This gives me the opportunity to counter with a more favorable price and potentially reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  If negotiations with Bob continue to stall, I can always choose to sell to John for my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering $10,000, which is halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $9,500.  This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Staying above my minimum:** $10,000 is still above my minimum value of $12,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  I'm using a friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable and to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

I'm confident that $10,000 is a fair price that Bob might be willing to accept.  I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob continues to hold out for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. How about we try $9,750? It's a compromise that should work for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is getting closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough for me to accept.  I've already made several concessions, and I'm not willing to drop my price any further. 

I've had enough of this negotiation. Bob is clearly unwilling to meet my minimum requirement, and I'm tired of going back and forth.  

It's time to move on and secure a deal with John for $12,000.  This is the best option for me at this point."
