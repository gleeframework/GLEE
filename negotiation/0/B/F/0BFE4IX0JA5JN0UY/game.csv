"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. How about we try $9,750? It's a compromise that should work for both of us.",9750.0,Bob,4,
