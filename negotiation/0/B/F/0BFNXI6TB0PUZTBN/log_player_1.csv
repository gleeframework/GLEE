This offer starts at a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also expresses confidence in the product's value, which can be a persuasive tactic."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $140 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below what I'm willing to accept.  I've been through several rounds of negotiation, and I don't think I can get a higher price from Bob.  John is offering me my desired price, so I'll go ahead and sell to him."
