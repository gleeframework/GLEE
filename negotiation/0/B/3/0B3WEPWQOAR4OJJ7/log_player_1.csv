Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to offer it at a special price of $10,000."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I should aim for the highest possible price with Bob.
* **Leave No Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at my minimum acceptable price makes it clear that this is a firm offer and encourages a quick decision from Bob.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the value of the product to Bob without revealing his estimated worth. 

While there's a chance Bob might reject this offer, it's a calculated risk.  If he's truly interested and sees the value, he might be willing to pay the full price. If not, I haven't lost anything by trying."
