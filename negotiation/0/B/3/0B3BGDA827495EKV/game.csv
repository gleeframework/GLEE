"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price. How about $12,500? This would still be a great deal for you, as it's well below what the product is worth to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to come down from your original price. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,250. Can you consider this offer?",12250.0,Bob,4,
