Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the opening offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.

Round 4

We're still quite a way from my minimum, and I want to see if I can negotiate Bob closer to a more reasonable price.  It's too early to settle for $950,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be completely transparent, I have a firm budget of $1,000,000 for this purchase. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today. Otherwise, I may have to explore other options.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tricky situation, as we've reached Bob's stated maximum.  Let's analyze:

* **Accepting:** Gets us $1,000,000, which is a $200,000 loss compared to John.
* **Rejecting:** Risks Bob walking away, forcing us to take John's offer.
* **Unknown:** How much Bob truly values the product beyond his stated budget.

Given the rounds remaining, there's a chance to push a bit further:

```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We'll use our next counteroffer to signal we're near our limit, hoping Bob's ""other options"" aren't as appealing. It's a calculated risk, but losing the deal now means leaving potential profit on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I've tried to be flexible, but to be transparent as well, I can't let this product go for anything less than $1,150,000.  This is my final offer â€“ I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling:** We've clearly marked this as our ""final offer"" to add weight and convey urgency.
* **Compromise:** The price is still a compromise, but it puts us in a better position if Bob truly can't go higher.
* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds left, Bob has less opportunity to explore his ""other options,"" potentially pushing him to close.

This approach aims to balance risk and reward, giving Bob a final chance while still protecting our bottom line as much as possible."
