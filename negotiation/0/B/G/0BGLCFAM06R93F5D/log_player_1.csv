Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1200000. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, but it's more in line with my financial constraints. I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
