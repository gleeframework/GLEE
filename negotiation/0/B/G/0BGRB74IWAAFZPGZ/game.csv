"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
