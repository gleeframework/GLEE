"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You want to save as much money as possible and have 9 rounds to negotiate. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still more than you want to pay. You have 7 rounds left to negotiate, and Alice has already shown a willingness to budge. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product to me and allows both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
