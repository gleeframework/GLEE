Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $200. It's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product enough to be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also ready to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering a price of $175. This is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. It's a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I hope this encourages him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not going to waste any more time on this negotiation.  John is already willing to pay my minimum, so it makes sense to sell to him now."
