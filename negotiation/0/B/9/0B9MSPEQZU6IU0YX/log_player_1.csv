Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a slight discount incentivizes a quick decision, avoiding the delay of going to John. 

This strategy balances risk and reward to achieve the best outcome for Alice."
