{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer sets a price higher than Bob's value of $80, but lower than my minimum acceptable value of $120. This gives Bob some room to negotiate, while still ensuring I earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is a better offer than Bob's initial value, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $85? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  Since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $120, I'll choose to sell the product to him."
