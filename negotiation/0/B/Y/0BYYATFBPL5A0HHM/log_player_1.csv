Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer gives Bob a good deal (he values it at $150), while still giving me a decent profit. It's a starting point, and I'm prepared to negotiate further if he's willing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$95 is a bit low for me, considering I can sell to John for $80. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
``` 

I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is still a good profit for me, but closer to Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is still a decent profit for me, and I'm not sure I can get him to budge further.  It's better than selling to John for $80."
