"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15,000 to you and we're willing to sell it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this works for you! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high for Bob.  While it's a discount from the $15,000 Bob values the product at, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get a good deal while staying within his budget.  He's offering a price that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still potentially attractive to her.  This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about purchasing the product but is also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose an alternative. How about we aim for a price closer to $11,500? This still leaves room for both of us to feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous one, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob should continue to negotiate and aim for a price closer to his counteroffer of $10,000.  He has plenty of rounds left and should not rush into a deal that isn't favorable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $10,000. It's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his initial counteroffer of $10,000. He's demonstrating his commitment to this price point and is not willing to budge much further.  By reiterating his reasons and highlighting the benefits for both parties, he's hoping to convince Alice to accept his offer."
