"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, which I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can save money by rejecting Alice's offer.  Since you're willing to pay up to $15,000, a counteroffer will likely lead to a lower price than $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable considering the product's value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still lower than your maximum price of $15,000.  This deal will save you $3,500 compared to buying from John. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and you having to buy from John at a higher price makes accepting her offer the most sensible choice."
