"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $120 to me, but I understand its value to you might be around $100. To ensure we both benefit from this transaction, I propose a price of $110 for the product. This way, you get a deal that suits your valuation, while I receive a profit. Please let me know if this offer works for you.",110.0,Alice,1,
