Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $120. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm aiming for a higher price than $100, so I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to $120. How about $110? It's a good middle ground and I'm confident you'll still get a great deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $105. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $105 is close to my target price, and I'm concerned that if I keep rejecting, he might walk away or I'll end up with the lower price from John.  It's best to accept and secure the sale."
