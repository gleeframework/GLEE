{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500.  Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing he values the product at $12,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Above Minimum:** The price is comfortably above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring a good profit even if Bob doesn't offer more.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you're secure knowing John will buy it for $10,000."
