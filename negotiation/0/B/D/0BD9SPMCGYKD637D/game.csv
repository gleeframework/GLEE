"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, worth a fortune to both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This reflects its value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we can move forward.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly.",825000.0,Bob,4,
