Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product, worth a fortune to both of us.  I'm starting with a price of $900,000.  This reflects its value and allows for some room for negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is not terrible, I'm aiming for a higher price. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired amount through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $850,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us and we can move forward.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $825,000. This would be a good deal for both of us and would allow us to close the deal quickly. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $825,000 is a good price, very close to my desired amount, and it's better than selling to John for $800,000.  I want to close the deal now."
