Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the value of the product.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still above his ideal price, it's a significant improvement on her initial offer and is below his maximum price point.  It's a good deal that allows Bob to save money compared to buying from John."
