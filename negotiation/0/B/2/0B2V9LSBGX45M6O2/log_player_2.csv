"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be happy to pay $10,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for 11500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is within my budget and is a better deal than buying from John for $15,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I might end up with no deal."
