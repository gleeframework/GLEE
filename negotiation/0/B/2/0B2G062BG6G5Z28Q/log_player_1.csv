"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100} 
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit, but I'm also being reasonable to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $120. I'll counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $90, given your interest.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counter-offering at $90. This is a compromise,  lowering my initial offer but still above Bob's offer. By showing a willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping to keep Bob engaged and move towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $90 is still a bit out of my budget. Can you consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that low. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate. I'll counteroffer in the next round, hoping to close the deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. Let's split the difference. How about $87? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

I'm offering $87, which is halfway between my previous offer of $90 and Bob's latest offer of $85. This shows that I'm willing to compromise and reach a mutually agreeable solution. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Can you consider $82.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $82.5 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a slightly better price with a counteroffer. I'll aim for a price slightly higher than Bob's offer in the next round, hoping to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counter-offering at $85.  It's slightly higher than Bob's last offer but still within a reasonable range.  By showing willingness to compromise, I hope to close the deal before the rounds run out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to making a decision, but $85 is still a bit out of my budget. Can you meet me at $82? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds remaining, I'm reaching the point where I need to make a decision. While I'm close to reaching an agreement with Bob, I'm still not at my desired price.  Given the limited rounds and my minimum acceptable value of $120, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit target, and I don't risk a last-minute negotiation breakdown with Bob."
