Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering the product at $150, you can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts, you've made a significant profit. 
* **Fallback Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always fall back on John, who is willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and how much you want to prioritize a quick sale, you might choose a different starting price."
