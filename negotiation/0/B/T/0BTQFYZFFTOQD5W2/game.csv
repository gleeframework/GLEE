"I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's try to reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $950,000 still doesn't cover my costs. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiations. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, so I'll offer $975,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
