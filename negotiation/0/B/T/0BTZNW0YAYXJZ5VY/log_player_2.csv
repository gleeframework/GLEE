You can do better than $12,000.  You should try to get a lower price."

I'm offering $10,000 for the product. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but still leaves some room for negotiation."

Alice's offer is better than John's, but still too high. I'll try another counteroffer."

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and hopefully a price Alice will be willing to accept."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's not my ideal price, accepting Alice's offer of $13,250 is still a better deal than buying from John for $15,000. It seems Alice is not willing to budge further, so accepting now is the best course of action."
