"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would give you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
