"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $950,000. I believe that's still a fair price considering the value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This strategy aims to establish a strong negotiation position and potentially push Alice towards a more agreeable price.  It's important to remember that Bob has a backup option with John, so he can afford to be a bit more aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This price still allows for a significant profit for you and is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, but still above his maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer gives Bob another opportunity to push for a better price, leveraging the fact that he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This would give you a solid profit and allows me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a counteroffer at his maximum budget, demonstrating his seriousness about buying the product while still trying to negotiate a better deal. This offer also presents a middle ground between the two previous offers, potentially making it more appealing to Alice.  The message emphasizes the benefit for both parties, highlighting the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
