Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,999. This is a fantastic deal on a product I know you'll love. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if you can get even more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting with a price just below your guaranteed sale price ($14,999) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the ""fantastic deal"" to entice Bob while still aiming for a price significantly higher than his perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's a chance Bob will reject this offer outright. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially gain an extra $1 from your guaranteed sale."
