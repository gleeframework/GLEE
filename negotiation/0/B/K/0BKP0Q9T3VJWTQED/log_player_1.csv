"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and leave room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial value of $80, it's still below my minimum. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering my minimum price.  Given that Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, I believe this is the best chance to close the deal without losing more time."
