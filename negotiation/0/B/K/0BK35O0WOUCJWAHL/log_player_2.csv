"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $15,000 and Alice's initial offer is $15,000, it's not advantageous to negotiate. You can get the product from John for the same price, so there's no reason to risk potentially getting a worse deal or wasting time negotiating."
