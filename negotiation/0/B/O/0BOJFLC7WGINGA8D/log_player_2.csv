Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $6,000 for the product.  Would that work for you?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? I'm confident you'll see a great return on this investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $14,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. Could you consider something closer to $7,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm aiming for a higher price, I'm willing to come down to $12,000.  This is my final offer, as it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to $12,000, which she states is her final offer. This means she's unlikely to go any lower.  Since you can get the product for $8,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut your losses and buy from John.  There's no guarantee you'll get Alice below $12,000, even with more rounds of negotiation."
