"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,000 is below my minimum price, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm getting closer to what I'm looking for, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't want to go above that.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,500.  That's a fair middle ground, and it allows both of us to walk away with a good deal.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still a bit below my target. I can meet you at $10,000. Can we call it a deal at that price?",10000.0,Bob,6,
