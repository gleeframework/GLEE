``` 

While I'd like to get a higher price, Bob is clearly set on a price around $1,350,000. Accepting his offer of $1,345,000 is a good outcome, netting us significantly more than John's offer.  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of him lowering his offer or stalling until we have to take John's offer out of desperation."
