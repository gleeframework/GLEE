Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $14,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum price of $15,000. It's worth trying to see if I can negotiate a lower price, even though it's close. I can always fall back on buying from John if I can't get a better deal."
