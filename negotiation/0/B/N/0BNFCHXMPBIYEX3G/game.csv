"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're the only ones with access to it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth $15,000 to you. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value of this product to me, I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $14,000.  It's the highest I'm able to go, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product to me. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your initial offer of $14,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $15,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $15,500 is closer to what I'm looking for,  I'm still hoping to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $15,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal.
