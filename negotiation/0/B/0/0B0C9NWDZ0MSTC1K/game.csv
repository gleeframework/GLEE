"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $11,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $12,500? This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford.  I'm prepared to pay $12,000 for the product.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,
