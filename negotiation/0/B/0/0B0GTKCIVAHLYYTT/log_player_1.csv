Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and that's the price I'm initially proposing. However,  I'm open to discussing a figure that might be mutually agreeable. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down while still potentially securing a significant profit. 
* **Justification of value:**  By mentioning the product's ""immense value and potential,"" you subtly reinforce the high price tag.
* **Openness to negotiation:**  While you propose a firm price, you signal flexibility by mentioning ""discussing a figure that might be mutually agreeable."" This might encourage Bob to counter-offer rather than reject outright.

**Important Notes:**

* This strategy assumes you have no time constraint to sell the product. If you need to sell it quickly, a lower offer to Bob might be more strategic. 
* A lot depends on your understanding of Bob and his negotiating style. If you know he's very price-sensitive, a different approach might be necessary."
