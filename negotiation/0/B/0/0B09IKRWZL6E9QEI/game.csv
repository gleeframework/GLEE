"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a significant discount from what the product is worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
