Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

**Reasoning:**  Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but it's clear he's aiming for a price well below what John is offering.  At this point, the risk of Bob's offer not reaching $1,000,000 within the remaining rounds outweighs the potential for a higher profit. Taking the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John is the safest and most logical choice."
