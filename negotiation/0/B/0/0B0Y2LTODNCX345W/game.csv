"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,900,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  This is my initial counteroffer, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,900,000 represents the high-end value I see in the product, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
