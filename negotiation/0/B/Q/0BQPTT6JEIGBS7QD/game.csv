"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm very interested in the product, and I believe it has great potential. To make this deal work, I'd be willing to offer you $850,000. I think this price is fair considering the value I place on the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'd like to counteroffer at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's potential and my initial offer of $950,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair compromise,  given my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'd like to counteroffer at $887,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the value you've placed on it. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go below this point. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",887500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $887,500 is still beyond my budget.  To make this deal work, I'm offering $850,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the maximum I can spend. I believe it's a fair price, considering the value I see in the product. Let's make a deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,
