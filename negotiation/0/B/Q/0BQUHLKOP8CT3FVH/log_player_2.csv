# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $10,000. What do you think?

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

I've already mentioned that's the minimum price I'm willing to sell it for to another buyer, and I'm not looking to sell it for that price to you. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a good discount from the $10,000 I initially offered. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I've already sold this product to another buyer for $8,000, and I'm starting to get a bit anxious to finalize the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away from the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is not budging from this high price point, and she's revealed she has a buyer at $8,000.  It's time to cut my losses and buy from John for $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result than my alternative."
