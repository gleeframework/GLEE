"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something that's worth $12,000 to you. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $12,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. Could we settle at $8,000?  That would be a fair deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $8,000. I've already mentioned that's the minimum price I'm willing to sell it for to another buyer, and I'm not looking to sell it for that price to you. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is still a good discount from the $10,000 I initially offered. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, you have come down quite a bit. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,750?  That's a fair compromise.",8750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not comfortable with $8,750. I'm willing to meet you at $9,250, which is still a good discount from the initial offer. I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, and I'd like to see if we can finalize it. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand we're both eager to close this deal. $9,000 is my final offer - it's a significant savings for me and still a decent profit for you.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I've already sold this product to another buyer for $8,000, and I'm starting to get a bit anxious to finalize the sale. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, which is the highest price I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away from the deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,9,
