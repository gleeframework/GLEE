Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's in great condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to counteroffer at $85. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than selling to John, I think I can still get a better price from Bob.  I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $90. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more than I'd get selling to someone else.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
