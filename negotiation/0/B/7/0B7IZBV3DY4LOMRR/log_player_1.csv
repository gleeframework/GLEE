Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120, you want to see if Bob will pay even slightly more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product just below your minimum acceptable price ($120) creates a sense of urgency and makes it more enticing for Bob. He gets a perceived discount while you still earn more than your fallback option. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is direct and highlights the ""special price"" to encourage Bob to act quickly."
