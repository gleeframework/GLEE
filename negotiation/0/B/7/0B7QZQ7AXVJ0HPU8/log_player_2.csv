Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I believe the product's value is worth more than $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, she's unlikely to go below $13,000.  You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000 from John. It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation with Alice when you can get your target price elsewhere."
