Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** $150 is above your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's not too high:** It's not so high that it scares Bob off immediately, leaving room for him to counteroffer. 
* **It's clear and concise:** The message is friendly and gives Bob a clear price.

Remember, this is just the first step. You'll have to analyze Bob's response and adjust your strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to find something within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is below your minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **You have leverage:** You know you can sell the product to John for $120, so you don't need to accept Bob's offer.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially reach a price you're comfortable with.

**Next step:** You should counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $100 but lower than $150. This will demonstrate your willingness to negotiate while still protecting your profit margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $100 is a bit too low for me. Would you be willing to consider $130? It's a fair price that allows me to make a profit and gives you a great deal on this product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** The counteroffer of $130 is a compromise between your initial offer of $150 and Bob's offer of $100. 
* **Reasoning:** The message explains why you can't accept his initial offer and emphasizes the ""fair price"" aspect of the counteroffer.
* **Positive tone:** The message maintains a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.

**Next steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:** Bob might accept your counteroffer, reject it, or make a new counteroffer. 
* **Prepare for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects your counteroffer, you'll need to consider if you want to continue negotiating or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still looking for a price closer to my budget. Would $120 be feasible for both of us? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer meets your minimum:** $120 is your minimum acceptable price.
* **No further gains:** You're unlikely to get a higher offer from Bob, and continuing negotiation risks losing him as a buyer.
* **Selling to John:**  While selling to John offers the same price, Bob might be a more valuable customer for future sales.

**Next Steps:**

* **Close the deal:** Accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. 
* **Build a relationship:**  Even though you negotiated, you've reached a mutually agreeable price, building a positive foundation for future interactions with Bob."
