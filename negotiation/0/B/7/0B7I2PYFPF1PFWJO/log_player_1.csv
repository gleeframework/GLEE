{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $100 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.  It's also friendly and engaging, encouraging Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, and it would be foolish to risk losing this deal entirely.  $90 is a solid profit for me, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
