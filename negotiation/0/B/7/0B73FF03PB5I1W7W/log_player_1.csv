Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a special price of $90. I think you'll find it's a great deal for what it offers."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $80, Alice knows she has a guaranteed $100 offer from John.  It makes sense to start negotiations higher than Bob's valuation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $90 leaves some wiggle room. If Bob counter-offers, Alice can potentially still sell it for more than $80.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes a ""special price"" and implies the product's value to entice Bob."
