Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** By stating that the price reflects the ""true value,"" you subtly imply that the product is worth more than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. 
* **Alternative:** You have a safety net with John, who's willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
