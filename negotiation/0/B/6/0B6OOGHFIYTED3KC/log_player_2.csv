"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure it'll be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get the price down closer to your $1,000,000 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $1,050,000 is lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,150,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value, and it allows us both to come to an agreement. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is still above your ideal price of $1,000,000 but within your budget of $1,000,000.  It's a good deal considering you could get it from John for $1,000,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential for Alice to increase the price again."
