"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $675,000 is still quite a bit below what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to go down to $700,000. This is a final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

At this point, it's better to accept Alice's offer. Negotiating further is unlikely to get you a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely. $700,000 is a reasonable compromise, saving you $100,000 compared to John's offer."
