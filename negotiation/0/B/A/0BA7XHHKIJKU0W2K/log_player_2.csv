"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since your goal is to save as much money as possible, rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes my intent to negotiate aggressively and sets the stage for a potential compromise.  While it's unlikely Alice will accept this right away, it forces her to consider a lower price point and opens the door for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved a bit closer to my desired price, $1,250,000 is still too high. I believe there's still room for negotiation to get a better deal.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue pushing for a lower price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly from the previous round. I'm trying to find a middle ground between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below my target.  Hopefully, Alice will be more receptive to this counteroffer and we can get closer to a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my target price, $1,300,000 is still higher than I am willing to pay.  I believe there's still room for further negotiation to secure a better deal. I'm not willing to accept an offer that is more than $200,000 above my ideal price point, so I'll continue to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,150,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, aiming for a price point closer to Alice's offer but still within my desired range. This demonstrates a willingness to compromise while maintaining my position of wanting to save as much money as possible.  If Alice rejects this offer, I'll have to reassess my strategy, considering the possibility of going with John's offer in the later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target, it's still not ideal. We're in the 7th round, and I'm running out of time.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating, but I'll need to be more aggressive with my counteroffers to reach a mutually agreeable price.  If the next round doesn't produce a satisfactory result, I may need to seriously consider buying from John to avoid losing out on the product altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,200,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only three rounds left, I'm making a significant counteroffer. This price is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer. I'm trying to make a final push to reach a deal. If Alice rejects this offer, I will likely have to buy from John in the next round to avoid losing out on the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's the 9th round, and Alice's offer is still $100,000 above my ideal price. I've exhausted most of my negotiation leverage, and with only one round remaining, there's a high risk of not reaching a deal.  Buying from John guarantees I get the product, although at a higher price.  It's a calculated decision to prioritize acquiring the product over maximizing savings."
