Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible while still earning a profit. I'll offer him the product for:

{""product_price"": $12,000}

This is a reasonable offer that still gives Bob a good deal, while also giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $10,000. Since this is lower than my minimum price of $12,000, I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further.

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $10,000, I'll increase my counteroffer by a reasonable amount to try to get closer to my desired price of $12,000. I'll offer:

{""product_price"": $11,500}

This is a compromise that still gives Bob a good deal, while also giving me a slightly higher price than his original offer."
