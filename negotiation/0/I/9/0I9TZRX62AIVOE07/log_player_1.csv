Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000.  This would still give you a good return on the product and leave me with some room to work with.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
