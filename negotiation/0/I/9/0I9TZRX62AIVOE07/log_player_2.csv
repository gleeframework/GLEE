"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. It's worth exploring if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to spend right now. I'd be happy to pay $1,000,000.  This would still give you a good return on the product and leave me with some room to work with.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,100,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good compromise.  While I'd prefer a lower price, it's still a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,500,000.  It's also within my budget, so accepting the offer is the best choice in this situation."
