"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think you'll find it's a steal. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  However, $1500000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1200000?  I'm very interested in acquiring this item, and I believe this price reflects its value while also being fair to both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1350000. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I think it's a great compromise. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice! $1350000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1300000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob! I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1300000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1320000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",1320000.0,Alice,5,
