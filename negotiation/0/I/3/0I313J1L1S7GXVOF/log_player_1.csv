Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my ideal price of $1,000,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I get the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I know John is willing to pay this amount, so I have a solid fallback option if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob sees this as a fair compromise and we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. While I would prefer to get closer to $900,000, I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob entirely.  I'm going to accept this offer, as it's a good compromise and ensures a sale."
