"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm willing to make a concession to get this deal done. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $800,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, but it's still too high for Bob.  While it's a significant concession, Bob is still better off trying to negotiate a lower price or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your increased offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is a better price than her initial offer. However, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price of $800,000. At this point, Bob is better off buying from John for $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks a deadlock or a longer negotiation process, which could ultimately lead to a worse deal."
