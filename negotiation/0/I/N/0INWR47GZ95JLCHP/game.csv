"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $82.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can make this work.",80.0,Bob,4,
