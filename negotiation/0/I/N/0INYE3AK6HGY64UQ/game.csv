"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range.  While $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000 to try and find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I hope you can meet me at this point.",900000.0,Alice,5,
