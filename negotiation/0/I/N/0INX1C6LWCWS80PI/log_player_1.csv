"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $120 is less than the $150 Bob values the product at, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **It's a clear and friendly message:**  Sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent price, it's still worth trying to get a little closer to my ideal price. I want to see if I can get Bob up to a higher price before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate you being upfront.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's still a great price for a product you'll love."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my ideal price. I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and it's likely that we're getting close to a final agreement.  Accepting the offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to sell to John at a lower price."
