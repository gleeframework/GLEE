"Hello Alice, thanks for starting the negotiation. While I agree the product is valuable, I think $1,000,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to offer $800,000 as a starting point. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering its value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle.  To be honest, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value while also working within my budget.",925000.0,Bob,4,
