(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a tough one, but it's better to accept the offer at this point. Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  There's a good chance she won't budge much, if at all, in the last round.
* **Time pressure:** You're in the final rounds.  If you reject and counter, you risk Alice not budging and being forced to either take her offer or John's, negating any potential savings. 
* **Significant savings:** You're still getting a discount of $210,000 compared to John's price. 

While there's a slim chance of getting the price lower, the risk of losing the current deal outweighs the potential for slightly more savings."
