"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product.  $20,000 is a bit steep for me, would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 might be a bit high for you, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $16,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $16,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I had in mind. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer, but $10,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you at $12,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let me know if that's acceptable to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
