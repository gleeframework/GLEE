"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is beyond my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000, which is still a good value for you considering you value it at $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This allows me to recognize your interest while still reflecting the true value of what's being offered.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is still above my budget. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering your value for it and my ability to pay.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
