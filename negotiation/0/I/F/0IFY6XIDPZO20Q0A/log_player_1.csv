Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but only at a much lower price point.  Would you consider $800,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely we'll bridge the gap quickly enough to make it worth passing on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
