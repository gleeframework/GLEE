"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  This product would be valuable to me, but only at a much lower price point.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. This product offers unique advantages and I'm confident it will yield substantial returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget in mind.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,000,000, but that's the highest I can go.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
