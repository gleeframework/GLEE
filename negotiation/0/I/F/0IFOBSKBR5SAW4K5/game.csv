"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for meeting me halfway, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. However, $12500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that price?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $11000. This is already a significant discount from my original price, and I think it's a fair offer. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not willing to go any lower.
