"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway and sell it to me for $160?",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $160 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $175.  This would still leave me with a good profit, and I think it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $175, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $175, which would be $147.50. Would you be willing to consider this price?",147.5,Bob,4,
