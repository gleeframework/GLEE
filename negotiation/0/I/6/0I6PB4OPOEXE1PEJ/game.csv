"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. As we discuss the price, I'd like to start with an offer of $18000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm really interested in this product, but I'd be more comfortable paying $12000.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $16000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $16000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $14000. I'm willing to make another compromise, though. How about we settle at $15500? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
