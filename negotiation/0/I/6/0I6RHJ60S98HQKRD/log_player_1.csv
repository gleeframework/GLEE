"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, even though it's less than what it's worth to me. This could make him more willing to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  I'm  prepared for Bob to counteroffer, which will allow us to find a middle ground.

**Important Note:** This is just the first round. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response, keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my profit and the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product to you, but I believe we can come to a more reasonable price. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  I believe I can push for a higher price with another counteroffer.
* **Not selling to John yet:**  Selling to John would guarantee me $1,000,000, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob. I'm confident I can improve on this offer in the next round. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll prepare a counteroffer in Round 3, aiming to bridge the gap between my desired price and Bob's offer. I'll also consider the number of rounds remaining and the likelihood of reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $950,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference at $1,075,000?  This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm again emphasizing the value of the product, reinforcing the idea that this price is fair.
* **Focusing on a win-win:** I'm framing the offer as a way for both of us to achieve a positive outcome, making it less likely that Bob will reject outright.

**Important Note:** This is a strategic move. By showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate, I'm hoping to increase the chances of reaching a deal with Bob before selling to John. However, I'll be closely monitoring the situation and be prepared to walk away if the negotiations don't move in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I've considered your offer, and I believe we can find a middle ground. How about $1,025,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Accepting Bob's offer:**  While it's slightly less than my desired price, $1,025,000 is a very good deal considering my minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.
* **Minimizing risk:** With only 6 rounds left, the risk of rejecting Bob's offer and not reaching an agreement is high. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting a lower price later or having to sell to John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Closing the deal:**  I'll confirm the details of the agreement with Bob and finalize the transaction. 
* **Future negotiations:** I'll learn from this experience and refine my negotiation strategies for future deals, keeping in mind the importance of compromise, understanding the other party's value, and managing risk."
