{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal for you, and it's worth a lot more to me. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $140 is higher than Bob's perceived value of $120, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $140 is still above your minimum of $150, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** This message is short, friendly, and gets straight to the point. 

By starting with this offer, you establish a reasonable starting point for negotiations while still leaving room to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's not worth selling to him at that price, even though he's the only other buyer right now. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to raise his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
