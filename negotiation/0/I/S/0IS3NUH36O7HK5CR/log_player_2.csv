You have three options:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate the offer, but $100 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking losing the product altogether. Buying from John guarantees the product at your desired price."
