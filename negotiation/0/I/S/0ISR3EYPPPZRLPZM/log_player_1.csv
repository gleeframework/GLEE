"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation and leaves room for me to potentially lower the price if necessary. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, it's important to start high and see how he reacts.  I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to counter-offer and try to bridge the gap. I'm also considering that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not in a desperate position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm hoping this will be a sweet spot that Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary.  I'm still mindful of my floor price of $1,500,000 and the option to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's getting closer to my floor price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm going to counter-offer one more time before considering selling to John.  I'm not desperate to sell at this point, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1850000}
```

I'm offering $1,850,000.  This is my final attempt to get a price closer to my initial goal while still leaving some room for negotiation. I'm considering the value of the product to me, the potential of further negotiations, and the opportunity to sell to John for $1,500,000.  If Bob rejects this, I'll likely move forward with selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're very close to a deal now, and I'm comfortable with this price. I'm also considering the possibility of continued negotiation, but I don't want to risk losing this deal altogether.  The price is significantly higher than my floor price, and I'm confident this is a good deal for me."
