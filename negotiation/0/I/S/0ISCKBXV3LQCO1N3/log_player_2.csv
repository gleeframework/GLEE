"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible.  While $120 is better than $150, you can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price and potentially get closer to your target of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $105. This is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer of $120, demonstrating my commitment to getting a good deal.  It's also within the range of what I'm willing to pay, while still leaving room for potential negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is tempting, it's still above my goal of $100. I'm only three rounds in, and there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting this offer gives me a chance to push for a lower price and see if Alice is willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 108}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $108. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product and am willing to compromise. It's still a good deal for me, and it's closer to my ideal price.  This might also encourage Alice to consider accepting the offer, knowing that I have the option to go to John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $115 is getting closer to my goal, but it's still above the price John is offering.  We're halfway through the rounds, and it's becoming clear that Alice isn't willing to come down significantly.  It's better to lock in the guaranteed price from John, which is within my budget and provides a sure deal."
