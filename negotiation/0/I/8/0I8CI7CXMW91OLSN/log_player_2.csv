"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know if you're interested, or we can explore other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Alice's offer of $14,000 is less than your maximum price of $15,000 and buying from John would cost you more. Accepting this offer saves you money."
