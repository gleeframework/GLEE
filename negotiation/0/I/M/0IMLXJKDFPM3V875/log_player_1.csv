Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Based on my assessment of the product's value and my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,160,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,160,000. 
You have three options:

While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $1,160,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Bob is clearly interested but price-sensitive.  Dragging this out further risks losing him, and $1,160,000 is a substantial profit."
