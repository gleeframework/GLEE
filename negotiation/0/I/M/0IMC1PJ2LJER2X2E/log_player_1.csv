Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's lower than your minimum desired price but still leaves room for potential profit. It also frames the product as valuable and relevant to Bob, making him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
While $100 is better than nothing, it's still below your minimum price of $150 and well below what you initially offered. It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand $100 is a good price, but I need to make a bit more to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $115? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While $110 is still below your minimum price, it's only $10 less than your last offer, and the negotiation has become more tedious. It's more beneficial to secure a sale at this point rather than risk further rejection from Bob and potentially losing out to John's guaranteed $150 offer."
