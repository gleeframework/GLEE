Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it can significantly benefit you. Given its potential, I'm offering it at $1,800,000."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While $1,400,000 is a good profit, I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'm not in a rush and willing to see what he counters with next."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the value of this product is significantly higher than your proposal. Let's meet in the middle - how about $1,650,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I still think there's room to negotiate. I'll counter slightly above his offer to show I'm willing to move, but not by much."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,575,000.  This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 1575000
}
``` 

By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency. This could push Bob to accept or make a more serious counteroffer.  We're getting into the later rounds, and I need to start pushing for a close."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,450,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob's countered with his ""final offer,"" and while it's not ideal, it's still a significant profit. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk him walking away entirely if I push further. Accepting secures a good deal at this point."
