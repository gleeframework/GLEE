"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that is worth at least $1000000 to me, but I believe it could be even more valuable to the right person.  I'm confident this product will be a game-changer for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1500000. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  While she claims the product is valuable, there's no guarantee it's worth more to you than John's offer. It's better to reject and go with the guaranteed lower price from John."
