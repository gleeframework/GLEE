Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's primary goal is to get as much money as possible, exceeding John's guaranteed offer.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" adds a time constraint, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Justification:** While not explicitly stating Bob's perceived value, the message hints at the product's worth to encourage a sale above $800,000. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a higher price point than John's offer while acknowledging the possibility of falling back on the guaranteed $1,200,000."
