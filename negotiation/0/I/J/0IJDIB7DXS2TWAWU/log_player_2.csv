"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $130 is within your budget, you can try to get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, so there might be room for negotiation. By rejecting her initial offer, you might be able to get her to lower the price closer to her $100 value."
