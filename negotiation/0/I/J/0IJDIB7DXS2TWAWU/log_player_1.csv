Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $150 valuation as possible without scaring him off.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a safety net with John at $100, so we don't need to go below that.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering $130 leaves some room for Bob to negotiate down if he wants, while still securing a good profit for Alice."
