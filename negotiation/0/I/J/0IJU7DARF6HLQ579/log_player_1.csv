Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer gives you a good chance of maximizing your profit. Here's why:

* **Better than John's offer:** It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Attractive for Bob:** While $10,000 is more than the product is worth to him ($8,000), it's still a potential deal if he values having the product.  

This offer provides a balance between maximizing your profit and giving Bob a chance to buy the product."
