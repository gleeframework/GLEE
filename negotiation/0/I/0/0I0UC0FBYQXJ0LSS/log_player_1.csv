{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to Bob's valuation. This way, we have room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit steep for me, would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum, I'm not ready to sell at that price. I'll try to counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That's still a fair price for a product you value at $120, and it's my minimum."", ""product_price"": 120}
