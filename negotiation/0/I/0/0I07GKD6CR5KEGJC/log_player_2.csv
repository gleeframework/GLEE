# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe it would be beneficial for both of us if we could come to an agreement. I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product for $12000. This price reflects its high value and quality, while also allowing you to enjoy significant savings compared to its market value. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $11500 for the product. This price reflects a compromise between our respective positions and allows you to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while still ensuring a fair return for me. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.
