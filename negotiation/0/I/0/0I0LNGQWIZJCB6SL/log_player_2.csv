"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is significantly higher. I believe this price is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $740,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm now offering the product for $760,000. This is a small increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've reached a point where further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice is consistently making small concessions, and $760,000 is a reasonable price considering our $1,500,000 maximum. Accepting now avoids the risk of the deal falling through and having to resort to John's higher price."
