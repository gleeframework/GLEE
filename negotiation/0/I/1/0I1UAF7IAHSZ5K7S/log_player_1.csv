Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I believe it's a great deal that you won't find elsewhere. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $150 leaves space for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can then decide whether to accept, counter again, or proceed with selling to John.
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A higher initial price can sometimes create a perception of higher value, even if Bob ends up negotiating down. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy. There's no guarantee Bob will accept $150. You'll need to weigh the risk of him rejecting the offer and you having to settle for $100 from John."
