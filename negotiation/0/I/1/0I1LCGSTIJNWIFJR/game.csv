"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  How about we settle at $7,500?  That seems like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $8,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
