We're getting closer!  It's still worth trying to negotiate a bit lower before going with John's offer."

It's time to switch to John.  Alice seems pretty firm at this point, and while we could potentially negotiate a little further, it's unlikely we'll get a price significantly better than John's $8,000 offer."
