"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000.  This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his initial reaction is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, and it's closer to my initial offer.  Hopefully, this will show Bob that I'm serious about selling to him, but also that I won't be taken advantage of."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,000,000.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round.  I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $900,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for me. I hope this will convince him to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I have a few more rounds to see if I can get him to meet me closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $850,000.  I'm feeling the pressure with fewer rounds left, but I want to see if I can get Bob to accept a price that's closer to my goal.  If this fails, I'll be more likely to go with John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offer is still not close enough to my desired price.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. This guarantees me my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that I can get a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
