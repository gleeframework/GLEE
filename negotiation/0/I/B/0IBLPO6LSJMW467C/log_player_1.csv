Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's worth a lot, but I'm willing to part with it for $180. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 180}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Justification:** While not giving away your bottom line ($150), phrasing like ""I think it's worth a lot"" subtly implies the value to you without being too aggressive. 
* **Direct Approach:**  Offering it to Bob ""first"" can create a sense of priority and potential scarcity, encouraging him to act quickly.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still giving Bob a price he might accept, considering the product's value to him is $150."
