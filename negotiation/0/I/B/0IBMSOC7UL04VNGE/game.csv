"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $850000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm looking to save as much as possible, but I'm also interested in making a deal. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, considering the product's value to me, I'm not comfortable going as low as $850000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $820000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $820000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose a price of $885000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",885000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a final counteroffer of $810000. I think this is my absolute maximum, and I'm hoping we can meet at this price. If not, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",810000.0,Bob,6,
