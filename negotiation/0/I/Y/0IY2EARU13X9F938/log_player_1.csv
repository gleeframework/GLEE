Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $11,500 leaves some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Avoid a Lowball:**  Going too low initially (e.g., $11,000) might make Bob think the product is worth less than it is. 

By setting a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, Alice increases her chances of a sale that nets her a significant profit over her minimum acceptable price ($10,000)."
