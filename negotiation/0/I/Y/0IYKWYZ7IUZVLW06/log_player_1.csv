"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $900,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer, leading to a mutually agreeable price.  I'm confident in the value of my product, and I want to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $750,000 is still a decent offer, it's significantly lower than my target price. I'm confident in the product's value and want to secure a higher price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round and aim for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $850,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's latest offer. I'm hoping this price point is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still allowing me to gain a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $700,000 is becoming increasingly unattractive.  While I'm running out of time, I'm not willing to settle for a price that is so far below my target. I'll counter-offer again in the next round and see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $825,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer, but still represents a significant profit for me. I'm hoping that this offer is finally attractive enough for Bob to consider, especially given that we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd prefer to sell to Bob for a slightly higher price, the negotiation is becoming increasingly difficult, and time is running out. I'm confident that I can sell the product to John for a guaranteed $800,000, which meets my minimum price requirement and secures a solid profit."
