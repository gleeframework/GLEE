"Bob, I'm offering you my product at $1,400,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset for a price well below its true worth.  I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. However, $1,100,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,250,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,250,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  $1,200,000 is closer, but I need to be at $1,225,000 to make this work for me.  I'm confident that this final price will be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to acquire a valuable asset at a fair price. ",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
