Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point. Here's why:

* **It's a reasonable starting point:** $100 is a good price that allows for some room to negotiate.  
* **It expresses confidence:**  You're not starting at the minimum price, which shows that you believe the product is valuable.
* **It invites conversation:** The message encourages Bob to respond and potentially share his thoughts on the price. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, so be ready to negotiate."
