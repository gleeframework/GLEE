Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your final offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not convinced that $715,000 is a fair price for this product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $725,000.

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $725,000.  Accepting now avoids the risk of her increasing her offer or you having to settle for John's much higher price."
