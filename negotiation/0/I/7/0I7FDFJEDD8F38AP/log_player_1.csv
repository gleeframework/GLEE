Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. But I can't go below $105. This is a fantastic product, and I believe it's worth every penny.  Let's see if we can find common ground at this price."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $100.  While I'd prefer to make more, Bob's offer of $85 is too far below my minimum. I don't want to risk losing the opportunity for a guaranteed $100 by continuing to negotiate."
