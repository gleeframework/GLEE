"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This gives me the best chance of securing a good price while also keeping the negotiation open for a few rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $13,000 is a good price, I'm holding out for a bit more. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than my minimum, and I have 8 more rounds to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm countering with a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still trying to get a better price than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, and I only have 6 rounds left. Accepting now gives me a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
