"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a fair starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  I believe this will encourage Bob to negotiate further, leading to a potentially higher final price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price.  I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
```

I'm offering $11,200 in this round. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I hope this will encourage him to come closer to my desired price without risking losing the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and it's likely that continuing negotiations won't yield much more.  With only 6 rounds remaining, it's important to secure a deal."
