"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go. I'm prepared to offer $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $750,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $800,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and it reflects the value we both know it holds. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
