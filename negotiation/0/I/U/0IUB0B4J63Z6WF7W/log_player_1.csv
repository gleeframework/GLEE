Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing further.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $10,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now.  I'm happy to offer $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach my minimum price. It's time to take John's guaranteed offer."
