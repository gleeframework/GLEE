Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,500,000. This price is higher than what John is willing to pay, giving me a chance to earn more.  However, it's important to remember that Bob's valuation is unknown. If he values the product less than $1,500,000, he'll likely reject the offer. In that case, I'll still be able to sell to John for $1,000,000, ensuring a profit."
