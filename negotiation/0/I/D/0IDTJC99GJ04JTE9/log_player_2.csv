"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its high value to you, I propose we start with a price of $10,000. This is a fair offer considering both the value it holds for you and the cost to me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While $10,000 is better than $12,000, you still have room to negotiate and get a better price.
* **You have 10 rounds:**  There's time to explore counteroffers and potentially reach a more favorable deal. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** You can always buy from John if the negotiation falls apart."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, considering it's worth $12,000 to me. I believe this is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. Considering the value of the product to you, I would like to suggest a price of $9,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise between the original price and your revised offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high, but getting closer:** $9,000 is better than $10,000, but you can likely get a better price.
* **There's room to negotiate:** You have 7 rounds left, so you can continue to explore lower prices.
* **John is still your safety net:** If the negotiation falls apart, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While $9,000 is closer, I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to offer $8,750. This price is still fair to me and I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Based on our previous discussions, I propose a price of $8,900 for the product. This is a reasonable compromise considering the value you place on it and my costs. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting very close to your ideal price:** $8,900 is only $400 more than your initial counteroffer of $8,500. 
* **You have limited rounds left:** With only 5 rounds remaining, there's a risk that you won't be able to get a significantly better deal.
* **John is still an option, but not necessary:** You can always buy from John for $12,000, but you're close to securing a good price from Alice. 

At this point, it's a calculated risk. You might be able to get a slightly lower price with more negotiation, but it's a good deal that saves you $3,100 compared to John's offer."
