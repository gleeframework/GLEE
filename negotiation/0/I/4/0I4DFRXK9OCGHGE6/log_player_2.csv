{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,000 is a good deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It's worth exploring if he can get a lower price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price as close to Alice's valuation as possible. A counteroffer of $10,500 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer and leaves room for negotiation. This counteroffer is also within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a lower price.  He still has 7 rounds left, so there's time to explore options before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing Alice that he's serious about buying the product.  $10,750 is still within his budget and is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's latest counteroffer.  This approach allows for continued negotiation without alienating Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's ideal price.  There are still 5 rounds left, and Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate. He's also closer to his ideal price than to John's price.  The risk of continuing is low, and the potential reward is greater."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to inch closer to Alice's price point.  $11,000 is a compromise between his last offer and Alice's offer, demonstrating his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget. There are still 4 rounds left, giving both parties room to reach a mutually agreeable price."

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. With three rounds left, there's potential to negotiate further. Bob should continue to counter-offer, aiming for a price closer to $11,000.  He's still within his budget, and a lower price is achievable with continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push to reach a deal.  $11,250 is a strong counteroffer, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.  This is a significant step closer to Alice's offer, indicating a clear desire to close the deal. With only two rounds remaining, Bob needs to strike a balance between pushing for a lower price and securing the product. This offer creates a strong foundation for a successful negotiation in the final rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only one round remaining, Bob needs to weigh his options carefully.  While $11,850 is still above his ideal price, it's only $850 more than his last offer.  He's already close to Alice's final price, and there's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further in the last round.  

It's also worth noting that buying from John would cost $1,150 more.  Considering these factors, it's more advantageous for Bob to accept Alice's offer in this round and secure the product."
