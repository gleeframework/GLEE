Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I could go up to $1,175,000, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure I can get him to come up higher within the remaining rounds. It's better to secure the sale now than risk losing more time and money."
