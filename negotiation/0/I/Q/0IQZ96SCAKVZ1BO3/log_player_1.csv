Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is lower than your minimum desired price, but still higher than the product's value to Bob. This strategy aims to:

* **Get the negotiation started:**  A reasonable initial offer encourages Bob to engage in further discussion.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** By not starting at your minimum, it allows for potential compromise and a more favorable outcome. 
* **Maintain leverage:** You can still accept John's offer if Bob doesn't agree, ensuring you have a backup option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than Bob's initial assessment, it is still below my minimum desired price of $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $9,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product at a value closer to what it's worth to me."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $10500 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,800 is a tempting offer, it's still below my minimum desired price of $15,000.  I'm confident in John's willingness to pay my asking price, and I'm not comfortable selling the product for significantly less than that.  Therefore, I'll choose to sell the product to John."
