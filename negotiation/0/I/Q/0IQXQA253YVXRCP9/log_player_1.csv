{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

This offer starts high, giving me room to negotiate.  I'm confident Bob will find the product worth $15,000, so this gives me a good starting point. If he rejects, I can lower my price slightly, but I have the option to sell to John for my minimum price if it goes too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 right now.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $15,000.  I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, this deal ensures I meet my minimum goal and avoids the risk of a protracted negotiation or losing the sale to John."
