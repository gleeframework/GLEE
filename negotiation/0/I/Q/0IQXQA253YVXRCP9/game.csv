"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $14,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $15,000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're open to that, we can finalize the deal. Let me know what you think.",15000.0,Bob,4,
