,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $1,300,000?  I think this price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,250,000. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value I'm willing to pay for the product.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While $1,250,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to go down to $1,275,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. ",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,275,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
