"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,400,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. This still gives us both a good deal. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000 for the product. That's my best offer so far.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
