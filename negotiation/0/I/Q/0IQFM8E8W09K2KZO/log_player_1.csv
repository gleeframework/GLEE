{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $12,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** It leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $15,000. 
* **It's a reasonable starting point:** It allows for a potential compromise and avoids a starting offer that's too high and could immediately turn Bob off. 

By starting with this offer, you're setting the stage for a productive negotiation. You're showing that you're willing to negotiate, but also that you value the product and believe it's worth a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product and understand its value. However, I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** While $12,000 is acceptable, it doesn't leave you any room for profit. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob acknowledges the value of the product, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  
* **Rejecting allows for a counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired amount.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price without immediately closing the deal. You're demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate while also aiming for a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This gives us both a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Reasonable price:** $13,000 is still above your minimum and below Bob's perceived value, indicating a fair price.
* **Positive messaging:** The message emphasizes flexibility and a desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 

This counteroffer shows that you're willing to negotiate and find a price that works for both of you. It also maintains a positive tone, which can be important in building rapport during negotiations."
