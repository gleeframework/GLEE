{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $20,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and friendly tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I subtly hint that the product is valuable to him without revealing too much information about its worth to me.

This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation while keeping in mind my goal of maximizing my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.** While I want to sell the product, I can't accept $10,000, which is significantly below my floor of $15,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation:**  Even though Bob's offer is far too low, I'm not giving up yet. There's room for negotiation, and I can make a counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John. This means I'm not desperate and can hold out for a better price from Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can attempt to get a higher price through further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $10,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $17,500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price while still being a compromise from my initial offer. 
* **Reasoning:**  I'm explaining why I can't accept Bob's offer, but also showing willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a Firm Stance:**  I'm not dropping my price too dramatically, showing Bob that I'm not desperate for a sale.

This counteroffer allows me to explore whether a deal can be reached while keeping my goal of maximizing my earnings in mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $12500. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  While he's moved closer, it's not enough for me to consider accepting. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net.**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which means I can afford to continue negotiating with Bob.
* **There's room for more negotiation:**  While Bob is hesitant about $17,500, I can make another counteroffer to see if we can find a price closer to my minimum while still being acceptable to him.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going, potentially reaching a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to make one final concession. How about $16,000?  This is a significant price drop from my initial offer, and it's the closest I can go without losing too much.  Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling to Bob that this is my final offer and that there's little room for further negotiation.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** The price is a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer.  This shows I'm committed to reaching an agreement.
* **Urgency:** The message subtly implies that if Bob doesn't accept this offer, I may have to go with John's offer.

This counteroffer creates a sense of urgency and puts the ball back in Bob's court, hoping to entice him to accept before I switch to my guaranteed deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $16000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for the product. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.**  Even though he's come closer, it's not enough for me to consider accepting.
* **John's offer provides a guaranteed profit.**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is a higher price than what Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.**  Bob has been consistently resistant to reaching my minimum price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation will simply waste time.

By selling to John, I can secure a profitable deal without risking further negotiation with Bob that might lead to a lower price."
