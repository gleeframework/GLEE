"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, I'm suggesting a price of $95 for it. This price reflects the high regard we have for this item and the effort put into its creation. I trust you'll find it worth the investment. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is higher than your maximum budget of $80 and also higher than John's offer of $80. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a lower price, saving you money."
