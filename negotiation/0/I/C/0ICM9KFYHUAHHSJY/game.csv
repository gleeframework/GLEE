"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I believe this price is fair considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. After careful consideration, I am unable to accept your offer at $1,250,000. However, I am willing to negotiate further. How about we aim for a price of $1,300,000? This still allows for a significant profit while considering the product's value to you. Let me know if this revised offer suits your needs.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your desire for a higher price,  $1,275,000 is the highest I can go at this time. It's a good compromise for both of us, and allows us to close the deal. ",1275000.0,Bob,4,
