**Reasoning:**

Bob has now revealed that he's considering buying a similar product from John for $800,000. This suggests his budget is firmly capped, and he's unlikely to agree to a price that significantly benefits me.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000, it makes the most financial sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
