"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your understanding of the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges its worth while recognizing your budgetary constraints.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit far from $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $975,000. I think this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer to meet halfway, the product's value is difficult to ignore. Let's settle this at $1,012,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",1012000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,012,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, and that's my final offer. I've already considered buying from John for $800,000, and I'm not sure I want to go that route if we can't come to an agreement.",980000.0,Bob,6,
