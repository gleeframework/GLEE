"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market value of similar products.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'd be willing to consider $950000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go below $1000000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can see the value in this product.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my previous offer and your current offer, so I'm counteroffering at $985000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",985000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1015000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you can see the value in this product.",1015000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $985000. I've made my final offer, and I hope you can accept it. If not, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $1200000.",985000.0,Bob,8,
