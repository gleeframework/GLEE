"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to see if Bob is seriously interested. I know the product is worth at least $800,000 to me, so I'm leaving room for negotiation.  This will also give me a sense of Bob's potential budget."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe there is room for a better deal.  I'm going to reject and see if I can push him higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly from Bob's offer. I'm trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I still believe there is potential for a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for $850,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm meeting Bob halfway, hoping to reach a compromise. This price is a good balance between my desired price and Bob's last offer."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum, but I'm worried that continuing to negotiate with him might result in a stalemate. I'm not confident I can get a higher price from him within the remaining rounds. John is a safe bet at this point, guaranteeing me the minimum I'm willing to accept."
