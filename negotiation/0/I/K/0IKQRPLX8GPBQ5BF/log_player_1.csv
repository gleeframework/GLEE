Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product.  I'm asking for $175 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, knowing Bob might counteroffer.
* **Reasonable margin:** $175 leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit. 
* **Friendly tone:** A positive message helps build rapport and makes the negotiation feel less adversarial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a compromise.
* **John is a safety net:** Even if the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  That's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** $125 is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  Highlighting a fair price for both parties can make Bob more receptive.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Keep the communication friendly to avoid creating a stalemate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $110?  I really want this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $110 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk vs. reward:** While Bob seems eager, I'm not willing to risk selling for significantly less than John's offer.
* **Potential for better deal:**  One more counteroffer might get Bob closer to my price.  If not, I can always sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $117 for the product. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this purchase."", ""product_price"": 117}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:**  This strategy often shows good faith and can help reach a compromise.
* **Final counteroffer:**  This is my final counteroffer before I move to selling to John.
* **Positive reinforcement:**  Reiterate that I'm willing to work with Bob and that he'll be happy with the purchase."
