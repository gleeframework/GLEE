"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
