"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I could only justify a price closer to $800,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 800000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $800,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. If you're still interested, let me know, and we can discuss the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is unwilling to go below her product's value to her. Since John offers the product for the same price, it makes no sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
