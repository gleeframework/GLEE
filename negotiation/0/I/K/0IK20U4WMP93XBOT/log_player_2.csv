"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to buy this product which I believe you'll find valuable.  I'm willing to part with it for $130. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is less than John's price of $150, but it's still above your $150 limit.  
* There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
