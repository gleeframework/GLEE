"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a similar product for less. How about $105? This would be a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $108. This is as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think?",108.0,Alice,5,
