Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's valuation but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This way, I maximize the chances of Bob accepting, as he'll still be getting a deal, while still getting a decent price for the product. If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John at my minimum price."
