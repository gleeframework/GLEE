"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and encourages Bob to counter.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive tone will hopefully encourage Bob to engage in a more collaborative negotiation. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value to Bob to potentially sway his decision. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.
* If Bob accepts, I'll have a successful negotiation.
* If the negotiation drags on, I'll be prepared to go to John as a backup option to ensure I receive my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $650,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob is clearly interested, and I can likely get closer to my desired price by counter-offering. 
* **No urgency to sell to John:** I have 10 rounds, so I have time to explore a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer that's higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This will signal my willingness to negotiate, while also maintaining a profitable margin."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $650,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $825,000? This would still be a great deal for you, considering the product's value.  Let's find common ground!"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm proposing a price halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer. This shows my willingness to compromise and encourages Bob to meet me in the middle as well.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations positive.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects my offer, I'll need to consider whether to continue negotiating or sell to John for my minimum desired price. 
* If Bob accepts, we'll have a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $825,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $725,000? That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal if we can agree. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $725,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm not willing to sacrifice that much profit.
* **Bob's urgency:** While Bob is expressing a desire to close the deal, his budget constraints are a clear indication that he's not willing to pay a significantly higher price. 
* **Negotiation room:** We are only in round 4, and I have plenty of rounds remaining to continue negotiating. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll counteroffer again, aiming to get closer to my desired price. I'll need to be firm but also willing to compromise to avoid losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* If Bob continues to refuse, I'll be prepared to sell to John in later rounds if I don't feel I can get a better deal with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While $725,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price.  How about we meet at $800,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to cover my costs and you to secure a valuable product.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can both achieve."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising:**  I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous offer, showing flexibility. 
* **Fair Deal:** I'm emphasizing that this price is fair for both of us, highlighting the value of the product to Bob while ensuring I don't take a significant loss.
* **Finality:**  I'm suggesting that $800,000 is the best deal we can achieve, potentially encouraging Bob to accept to avoid further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll closely monitor Bob's response. If he rejects, I'll need to decide if I should continue negotiating or sell to John.
* If Bob accepts, I'll have achieved a good outcome.  
* If the negotiations continue to stall, I'll be prepared to move to John in later rounds if necessary."
