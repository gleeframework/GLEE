Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal."", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility on price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows you to be more ambitious with your initial offer to Bob."
