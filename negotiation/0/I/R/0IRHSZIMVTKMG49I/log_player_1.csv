Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has value, $1,000,000 is a bit high for me.  How about we start the negotiations at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
