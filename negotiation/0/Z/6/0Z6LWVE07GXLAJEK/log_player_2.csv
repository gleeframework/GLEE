"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer.  He can likely get a better deal by counteroffering.  While $1,150,000 is better than $1,200,000, there's room for negotiation before having to go with John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,100,000?  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. $1,100,000 is a good price considering his maximum budget is $1,200,000.  Further negotiation could potentially lower the price, but the risk of Alice rejecting and having to buy from John makes accepting the offer the most logical choice."
