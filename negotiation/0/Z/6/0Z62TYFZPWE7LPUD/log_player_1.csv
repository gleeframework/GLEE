I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit.  However, I'm also prepared to negotiate if Bob counteroffers.  If the negotiation drags on or if Bob seems uninterested, I'll switch to John's offer of $1,000,000 to guarantee a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is way too low.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  If he refuses to budge, I'll sell to John."

I'm dropping my price a bit, but still leaving some room for profit.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000.

Bob is still low, but getting closer. I'm going to counter one more time to see if we can reach an agreement. If not, I'll go with John's offer."

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this one. This is my final offer. If he rejects, I'm selling to John."

I've been through several rounds of negotiations with Bob, and while he's coming up in price, he's still not willing to meet my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
