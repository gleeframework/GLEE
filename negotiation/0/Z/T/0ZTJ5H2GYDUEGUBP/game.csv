"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. This represents a significant investment for me and I believe it's a fair starting point for further discussions.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, however,  $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  This price reflects the true value and potential of what I'm offering.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  Considering the potential benefits for both of us, I'm proposing $1,200,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
