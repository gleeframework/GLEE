"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's high, but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows me to see if Bob is truly interested in the product and what his upper limit might be. I'm also being friendly and positive to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price, especially since I know the product is worth more to him. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is below my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  Let's split the difference - how about $8,250? "", ""product_price"": 8250}
``` 
I'm trying to find a middle ground that's still profitable for me but also shows that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we try $7,500?  That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still offering too low.  While I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds,  I'm going to stick with my minimum price for now and see if I can get him to move.  I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $7,500 is still below my minimum. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but  $8,000 is the lowest I can go.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm sticking to my minimum, but I'm trying to be flexible by offering a ""meet in the middle"" scenario.  I'm also stressing that this is my absolute lowest price point.  I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to make a final decision."
