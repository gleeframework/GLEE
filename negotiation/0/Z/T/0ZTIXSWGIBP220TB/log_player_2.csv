"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"", 
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer aims to get a price significantly closer to Alice's perceived value of the product while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $125?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down significantly in price, and $125 is a good deal compared to John's $150 offer. There's a small chance of getting it lower, but the risk of losing the deal isn't worth it."
