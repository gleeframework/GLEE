"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair margin for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $920,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential it holds. ",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the adjustment.  While I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential,  $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This price reflects a fair value for the product and allows for a successful transaction.  I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation for this deal to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this deal through, but I need you to recognize the true worth of this product.",890000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the adjustment.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $890,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $870,000, which represents a fair compromise.  This price allows for a mutually beneficial deal and ensures a smooth transaction. Let's find common ground and finalize this purchase.",870000.0,Bob,6,
