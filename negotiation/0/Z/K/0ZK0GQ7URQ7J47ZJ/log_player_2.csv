"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its incredible potential value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is a better deal than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity,  $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair margin for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Counter:** Bob wants to start negotiating aggressively, so he's offering a price significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. 
* **Justifying the Price:**  He provides a reason for his offer, emphasizing the value he sees in the product and fairness for both sides. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer is still higher than Alice's minimum acceptable price of $800,000, indicating that he's willing to negotiate but also has a firm lower limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  However,  the value this product brings, especially to someone like you, is truly significant. I could consider coming down to $920,000. This price reflects the unique benefits and potential it holds.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob wants to pay.  He's likely to be able to get a lower price by continuing to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a strong position, allowing him to control the negotiation process and potentially push for a more favorable price.
* **Avoiding a rushed decision:** Accepting at this point could lead to regret later, as Bob might be able to get a better deal with more rounds of negotiation."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the adjustment.  While I appreciate your understanding of the product's potential,  $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.

I'm confident that we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need you to meet me closer to my valuation for this deal to make sense. I'm willing to come down to $890,000, but that's my final offer. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to see this deal through, but I need you to recognize the true worth of this product.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
