"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly valuable. I believe it's worth more than what others might offer, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's start with my offer: $100.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be interested in buying it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a mutually beneficial solution. Considering our previous discussions, I am willing to adjust my offer to $90. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $87.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm glad we're getting closer. To continue moving forward, I propose we set the price at $89 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions.",89.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're almost there.  $89 is still a bit high for me.  How about we settle on $86?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal.",86.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a fair price. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept $88 for the product. This feels like a reasonable compromise between our initial offers.",88.0,Alice,7,
