"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $800,000, so there's potential to get a better price. By rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer, Bob can try to secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her valuation of the product. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating that Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer to $925,000, which is still better than buying from John for $1,000,000.  There's a possibility of further negotiation, but the risk of Alice walking away or pushing the price higher increases. Accepting this offer secures a good deal while keeping the negotiation process efficient."
