"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a little too high for me right now. Could you do $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $10,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about we try $11,500? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product at this price.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  To be honest, $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  How about we settle at $10,500? That would work much better for me.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,500 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to compromise further. How about we try $11,000? It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To be completely transparent with you, $10,700 is really the highest I can go.  If you're able to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10700.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,700 is a significant compromise, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. How about we try $11,200? It's a small increase from your offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product's value.",11200.0,Alice,7,
