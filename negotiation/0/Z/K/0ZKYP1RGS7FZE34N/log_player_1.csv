"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product will be a valuable asset for you. I'm happy to offer it to you for $2,000,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Starting with a high initial offer is a common negotiation tactic. It allows room for negotiation and might give the impression that the product is even more valuable than Bob initially perceived."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $1,800,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than your initial asking price.  Bob's counter-offer suggests he's willing to negotiate within a potentially favorable range. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and allows you to counter with a price closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is significantly below my initial valuation. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to accept $1,900,000 for the product."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  

This counter-offer achieves several things:

* **Signals Flexibility:**  It shows Bob you're willing to move from your initial price, demonstrating a desire to find a deal.
* **Sets a High Floor:** By only slightly reducing the price, you're setting a high floor for further negotiation.
* **Maintains Value Perception:**  The message reinforces the product's value, justifying the relatively small price reduction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  

Bob has moved another $100,000 down from his previous offer, but he's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to secure a deal, accepting now might signal you're overly eager and could leave money on the table. You have room to negotiate further, and selling to John is always an option if the gap remains too large."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end, and I want to be straightforward.  $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go for this product. It represents a significant value for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Flexibility:** The message makes it clear that you are nearing your bottom line while still keeping a small margin for negotiation. 
* **Value Emphasis:** By reiterating the product's value, you are reminding Bob of the potential benefits and justifying the price. 
* **Time Pressure:** By hinting at other options, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your honesty, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,650,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a reasonable compromise. Here's why:

* **Above Minimum:** It's $150,000 above your absolute minimum price, representing a significant profit.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer throughout the negotiation, indicating a strong desire to acquire the product.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might not yield a significantly better offer, and there's always a risk of Bob walking away. Accepting now secures a good deal without further delay."
