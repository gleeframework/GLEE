"Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your time and consideration. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is below my minimum.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,400,000.  This offer represents a fair deal for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're willing to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $1,350,000 is a little too low for me to accept. How about we settle right in the middle at $1,375,000?  This would represent a fair compromise for both of us.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,375,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,325,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
