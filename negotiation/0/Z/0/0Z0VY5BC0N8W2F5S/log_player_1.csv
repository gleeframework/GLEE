"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts high, leaving room for negotiation. It also conveys excitement and positions the product as valuable to Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a price of $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a good deal, I'm aiming for a bit more.  Rejecting and counter-offering gives me more leverage to potentially reach a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit to $9,500. This is still a great price for the value this product offers you. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,800 is close to my minimum, I'm not desperate.  There's still room to negotiate a bit higher.  I'll reject this offer and try to get closer to my goal of $9,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,150? This would be a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Even though $8,500 is only $500 away from my minimum, I'm still going to reject this offer. I've already shown willingness to compromise and Bob hasn't budged much. With a few rounds left, I want to see if I can get him closer to my desired price point."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue working with you.  Let's bridge the gap with a price of $8,750.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. "", ""product_price"": 8750} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,200 is close to my minimum, I'm still going to reject this offer.  There's only a couple rounds left, and I'm not going to give up without trying to squeeze out a bit more.  The difference between $8,000 and $8,200 is only $200, so I'll see if I can get closer to my minimum before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm also trying to get a fair price for my product. I'm willing to come down to $8,400.  This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept, I'll have to move on to another buyer. "", ""product_price"": 8400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that's your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,200. If you're not willing to accept, I'll have to consider buying from John for $12,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

It's the final round, and even though Bob's offer is still below my ideal, it's only $200 away from my minimum.  It's not a great deal, but it's better than selling to John for $8,000. I'll accept Bob's offer to avoid losing out on the opportunity."
