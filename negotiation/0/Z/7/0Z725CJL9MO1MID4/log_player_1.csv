Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  Thank you for the offer. While I'm interested, $20,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $15,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is right at my minimum acceptable price.  There's no room for further negotiation.
