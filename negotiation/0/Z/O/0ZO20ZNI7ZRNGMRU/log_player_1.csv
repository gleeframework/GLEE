{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is closer to my value ($10,000) than Bob's value ($8,000), hoping to capture a good portion of the surplus.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By setting a price of $9,500, I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without immediately resorting to John's offer of $10,000. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the ""deal"" aspect of my offer to encourage Bob to consider it. 

This approach balances maximizing my profit with keeping the negotiation open for a potential better outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay $8000 for it. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $8,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000. Accepting it would result in a substantial loss.
* **Potential for a better outcome:** Even though Bob claims his offer is final, it's unlikely he's completely inflexible. By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000, guaranteeing I don't lose money. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and have the opportunity to potentially achieve a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? This price reflects the true value of the product and allows for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and fairness:** I'm offering a price that is midway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,000). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a fair price for both of us.
* **Reiterating value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and respectful tone to encourage further negotiation.

By offering $9,000, I'm showing flexibility while still holding out for a price that is closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the value of the product, I would like to propose $8500 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $8,500 is still below my minimum value of $10,000, even though it's a slight improvement from Bob's previous offer.
* **Further negotiation possible:** Bob has shown some flexibility, so it's possible I can push for a price closer to $9,000 with another counteroffer.
* **John's offer is the safety net:** If negotiations fail, I can always sell to John for $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and try to secure a more profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. Considering the value of the product and our ongoing negotiation, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to make a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway again:** I'm again offering a price that's in the middle of my last offer ($9,000) and Bob's current offer ($8,500). This shows continued flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing value and compromise:** I reiterate the product's value and highlight the fact that this is a compromise, making my offer more appealing.
* **Last chance offer:**  I'm framing this as a potential final offer to encourage Bob to seriously consider it, while leaving room for a small adjustment if necessary.

By offering $9,250, I'm aiming to get closer to my desired price while leaving room for a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued willingness to negotiate. Based on the value of the product and my budget, I would like to propose $8750 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but still too low:** While Bob's offer of $8,750 is closer to my minimum value of $10,000, it still represents a significant loss for me.
* **Limited room for negotiation:**  It's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  Further counteroffers might only result in more frustration and a stalemate.
* **John's offer is the best option:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $10,000, which is more beneficial than accepting Bob's offer and accepting a loss.

This situation highlights the importance of having a backup option like John's offer.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, securing the minimum value from John is the most sensible decision given the current negotiation dynamics."
