Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it can be a valuable asset for your business too. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to incentivize negotiation.
* **Offering a Discount:** The discount is substantial to make the offer seem appealing and encourage Bob to engage.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on the value the product brings to Bob and emphasizing a mutually beneficial outcome. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether it's worth continuing negotiations or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,100,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum threshold.** While it's closer to my target price, it's still less than the $1,500,000 I'd get from John.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation, as Bob has shown interest and is willing to pay above his initial valuation.
* **Minimizing risk:** I'd rather continue negotiating with Bob and try to get a better price before resorting to selling to John.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our current positions."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product highly, I'm willing to compromise. Let's split the difference. How about $1,150,000?  This would give you a great deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this transaction worthwhile.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the benefits for Bob, emphasizing a ""great deal"" and a ""worthwhile"" transaction.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and negotiation, inviting Bob to respond and potentially reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! We have a deal.
* **Bob Rejects:** I'll carefully consider his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter again, or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I am still working within my budget constraints. Could you consider $1,100,000 as a fair price for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No further room for negotiation:** Bob has stubbornly stuck to his initial counteroffer despite my attempts to find a compromise. There's a significant gap between our positions, and further negotiation seems unlikely to produce a satisfactory result.
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing negotiations with Bob risks losing time and the opportunity to secure the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.
* **Minimizing loss:**  While I would prefer to get closer to my target price, selling to John is the most sensible option to ensure a solid return and minimize the potential for further negotiation failures. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale."
