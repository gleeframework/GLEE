Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $100. I know it's a fair price for something of this quality. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation is Irrelevant:** While Bob values the product at $80, we know we have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100. Therefore, we should aim to maximize our profit.
* **Starting High:** It's always good to start with an offer closer to your desired price.  There's a chance Bob might accept it outright.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation (Slight):** While we start at $100, the phrasing ""limited time"" subtly implies there might be a slight wiggle room if Bob is truly interested but needs a tiny nudge. 

This approach gives us the best chance of securing the highest possible profit."
