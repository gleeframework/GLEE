"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this valuable product. I believe it's worth $15,000, but I'm willing to start the negotiation at $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's starting offer is higher than what you value the product for. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $11,000?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. This product offers a lot of value, and I'm confident it's worth the investment. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While closer to your desired price, $12,500 is still above your target. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get closer to $11,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I have a firm budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

We're holding firm closer to our desired price, but offering a slight concession to encourage Alice to move closer to our range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're serious about this product.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm looking for something a little closer to $12,000. Would you be willing to agree to $12,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving closer to our range, but we're still not at a price we're happy with. We'll continue negotiating and see if we can get her closer to $11,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I appreciate your flexibility. How about we split the difference and settle on $11,875?"",
""product_price"": 11875
}
``` 

We're proposing a price that's directly in the middle of our last two offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below our initial target."
