Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,200,000 is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation, as Bob can counter with a lower price, allowing for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually agreeable price.
* **Time Pressure:**  While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, starting negotiations with Bob allows me to see if I can get a better price without losing out on John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,000,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can still try to negotiate a higher price with Bob. There's a possibility he might be willing to increase his offer slightly, especially considering the product's value to him.
* **Avoiding Loss:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit, but rejecting Bob's offer gives me the opportunity to potentially earn more. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking to stay within a budget, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  My counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($1,000,000). 
* **Highlighting the value:** I emphasize that this is still a ""great deal"" for Bob, reminding him of the product's value to him.
* **Moving forward:** By saying ""it would allow me to move forward with the sale,"" I subtly suggest that I'm open to negotiating, but also have other options available. 

This approach aims to keep the negotiation going while making it clear that I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly below my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still looking to keep my expenses lower. Would you consider $950,000 as a fair offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $950,000 is still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Limited negotiation space:**  While there is room for another counteroffer, the difference between our desired prices is significant.  
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob that might lead to an even lower price. 

It's important to prioritize my own financial goals and not risk losing a guaranteed profit for a potentially better, but uncertain, outcome with Bob."
