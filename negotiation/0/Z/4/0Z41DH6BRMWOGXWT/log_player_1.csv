# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to me and your desired selling price. Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
