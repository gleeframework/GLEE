"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's a game-changer in its field, offering unparalleled benefits and value. Given its exceptional quality and the impact it can have on your endeavors, I believe it's worth every penny of its true value, which is $10,000. However, to make this opportunity more accessible, I am offering it to you for $9,500. This is an exclusive offer tailored to recognize your discerning taste and commitment to excellence. Don't miss out on this chance to elevate your experience or project. Let's discuss how we can make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is still above your maximum budget and what you know the product is worth to her. By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially counter with a lower price, closer to her $8,000 valuation. If she doesn't significantly lower the price, you can always fall back on buying from John for $10,000."
