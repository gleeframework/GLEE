"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $115?",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get what we want.",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you at $112.50, which is closer to my original offer of $110. Can we do that?",112.5,Bob,4,
