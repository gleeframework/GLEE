"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial value, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering Alice $1,250,000, which is still a decent profit for her, but closer to my maximum budget. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm willing to go slightly higher if needed, but I'll stick to my limit of $1,200,000 if Alice becomes too stubborn."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can convince her to come down further. I believe there's still some wiggle room, and I'm not yet ready to settle for a price above $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,300,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, while still staying within a range that's comfortable for me.  This price is a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and Alice's counteroffer.  I believe this could be a sweet spot for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is getting closer to her original asking price and further away from my budget. It seems she is unwilling to budge much further. At this point, it's more advantageous for me to buy from John for $1,200,000.  This secures the product within my budget and avoids any further risk of Alice increasing her price again."
