"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start at a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair value considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to discuss further or if you'd like to make a counteroffer.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you think $900,000 is a bit low, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,100,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer, but still a fair value for the product's worth to you. Let me know if this is more in line with what you're looking for.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $1,000,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $1,050,000, which is a good compromise between my initial offer and your latest one. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough!  I'm willing to go up slightly to $1,025,000.  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
