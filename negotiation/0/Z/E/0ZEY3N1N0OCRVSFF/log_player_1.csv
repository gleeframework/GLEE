Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $1,700,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.  Let's try to meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Explanation:

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear we're not going to reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Selling to John at $1,500,000 ensures we get our minimum acceptable price without further negotiation and potential for a lower final offer from Bob."
