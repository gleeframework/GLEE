"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $87.50 is a fair compromise.  It's closer to your offer than mine, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $87.50. How about we meet in the middle again at $90? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $88.50, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't reach an agreement at that point, I'll have to consider other options.",88.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $88.50. How about we meet in the middle again at $89.25? It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",89.25,Alice,7,
