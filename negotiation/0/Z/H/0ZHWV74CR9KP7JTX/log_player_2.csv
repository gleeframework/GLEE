"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is better than John's price, it's still above what the product is worth to Bob.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about we split the difference and I pay $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $90 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's a great value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $92.50 is still higher than what the product is worth to Bob. Rejecting the offer gives Bob another chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, and I think $87.50 is a fair compromise.  It's closer to your offer than mine, and I believe it's a price we can both be happy with."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to consider your offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to go as low as $87.50. How about we meet in the middle again at $90? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is back to her original offer of $90.  While this is better than John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're sticking to $90, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $88.50, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't reach an agreement at that point, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your limit, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $88.50. How about we meet in the middle again at $89.25? It's a small step down from my original offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89.25. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89.25
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $89.25, which is only slightly higher than Bob's last offer of $88.50.  At this point, accepting the offer makes sense.  Bob is likely to get a better price than from John, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or Alice walking away."
