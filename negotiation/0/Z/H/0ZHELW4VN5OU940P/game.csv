"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm also trying to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $13500 to make this worthwhile. It's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. How about we meet in the middle at $13500?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to make a profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $13000. That's the highest I can stretch it. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,4,
