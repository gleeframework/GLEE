Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $140. This is a good starting point because it's above my minimum price of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $125. While it's above my minimum price, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price of $140.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $135. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation while remaining above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal for me and above my minimum price of $120. Further negotiation could result in a lower price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John."
