Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and ensuring you make a healthy profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.
