"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and ensuring you make a healthy profit.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for me, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
