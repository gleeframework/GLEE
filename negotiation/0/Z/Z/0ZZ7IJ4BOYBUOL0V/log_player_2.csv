"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to her, but it's still above Bob's target price. Bob can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and ensuring you make a healthy profit."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for me, and it's closer to your budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still higher than her minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, so it's likely she's willing to negotiate further. However, Bob's target price is $1,500,000, and accepting this offer will save him $150,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good deal for Bob, considering he can always try to negotiate further down the line if he needs to."
