"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $850,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I value our negotiation,  $750,000 is unfortunately too low for me to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $800,000. This price reflects the product's true value and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  I believe this is a good compromise. Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,3,
