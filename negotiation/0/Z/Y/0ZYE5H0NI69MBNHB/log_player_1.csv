Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I think you'll find it a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($80) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $95 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $100 gives us leverage. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum."
