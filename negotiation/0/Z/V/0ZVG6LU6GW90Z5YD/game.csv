"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $130. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, and I think that's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",110.0,Bob,4,
