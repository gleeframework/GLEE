"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Can you meet me at that price?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $85?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a fair price for the product.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $85 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so how about $77.50?",77.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $77.50 is still a bit too low for me. Let's compromise again - I'll come down to $82.50.  This gives you a good price, and I can still get a reasonable amount for the product.",82.5,Alice,5,
