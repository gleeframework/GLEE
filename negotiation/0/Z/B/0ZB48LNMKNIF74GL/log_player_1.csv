"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth more to me than Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially close the deal at a higher price.  I'll keep in mind the possibility of selling to John if things don't work out with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly the minimum I'd accept. However, I'm confident I can get more.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm going to lower my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit above Bob's initial offer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm flexible but still want to maximize my earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is $1,000 more than my minimum acceptable price and it's only round 4. Accepting this deal guarantees me a profit, and I'm not sure I can push Bob any higher. There are still rounds left, but there's always a chance of things going south and I might end up selling to John for less."
