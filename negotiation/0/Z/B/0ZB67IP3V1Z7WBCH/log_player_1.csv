Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to propose $7800. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Bob's offer.  While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to go below $8,000 just yet. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going below $8,000.  How about we compromise at $8,200?  This is a fair price that allows us both to get what we want."", ""product_price"": 8200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target. I'd like to propose $7600. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to be careful with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $8,000. It seems like Bob is very firm on his budget, and while I'm not willing to go below $8,000, I'm also not confident I'll get a better offer from him.  John's offer is a safe bet."
