"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $9,000 is higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. 
* You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or simply buy it from John at your maximum budget."
