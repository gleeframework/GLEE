"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, I'm afraid I can't meet you at $120. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $170. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $140?",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already made a compromise by meeting you halfway from my original offer. I'm willing to make another slight concession, but I need to ensure I'm not losing too much. How about we meet at $160?",160.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $160. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $170. How about $155?",155.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to pay a bit more, Bob! However, I've already made a few concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $158, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll love the product.",158.0,Alice,7,

"I'm still not comfortable with $158. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above $155. Can you meet me at that price?",155.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already met you at $158, and you're now asking me to go back to $155? I'm afraid I'm not willing to do that. I'm going to have to draw the line somewhere. I'm willing to meet you at $159, but that's it. It's the best I can do.",159.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $159. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'm not willing to go above $155. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $155, I'll have to consider buying from John for $150.",155.0,Bob,10,
