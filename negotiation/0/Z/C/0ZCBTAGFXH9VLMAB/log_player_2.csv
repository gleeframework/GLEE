Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

 ""product_price"": 95
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $95, Bob. I can do $115, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice is very unlikely to go below $115, and we have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $100 from John. It's better to take the sure thing at this point than risk getting stuck with a worse deal from Alice."
