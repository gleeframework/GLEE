"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It makes more sense to reject and counteroffer, or to buy from John as a backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to your desired price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum. It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if you can get closer to $8,000. There are still several rounds left, and it's possible to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, lowering her price from $11,000 to $9,500.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise that splits the difference. This offer is still within your budget and might be appealing to Alice as she is likely eager to sell."
