"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 11000} 

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $8,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. However, if he rejects, I'm confident I can sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer and see if I can reach a better deal with Bob. There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desired profit margin. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in reaching a deal with me rather than risking losing the product entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd prefer to get $10,000, I'm starting to feel the pressure of limited rounds. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing out completely if I keep negotiating and Bob changes his mind."
