Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is close, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can make a deal work at that price.
