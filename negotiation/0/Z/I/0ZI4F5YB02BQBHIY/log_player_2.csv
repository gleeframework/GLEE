Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $900,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I agree the product is valuable, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 700000}"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I see you're still a bit far from my target price, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you a price of $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, you've been very accommodating and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is close, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Would you consider $750,000? That's a significant investment for me, and I'm hoping we can make a deal work at that price."", ""product_price"": 750000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I've been flexible with the price, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the point where it's not worth my while to continue negotiating. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,000,000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly getting impatient and her price is going in the wrong direction. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000.  There's no point in risking missing out on that deal when Alice is unlikely to meet your price needs."
