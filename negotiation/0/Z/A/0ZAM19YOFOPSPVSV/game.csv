"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. My counteroffer is $13,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. Let's make this happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is still a bit low for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My next counteroffer is $12,500 for the product. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's a fair compromise.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,500 is still a bit more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This is a good deal for both of us. Let's make it happen!",11000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession. My next counteroffer is $12,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",12000.0,Alice,7,
