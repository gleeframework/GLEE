"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. This product sounds promising, but $900000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800000? I'm confident this product has great potential, and I'm eager to work with you to make it a success.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $800000, which would be $812500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product.",812500.0,Alice,5,
