"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is high:**  $900,000 is close to my limit, but I want to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **Multiple rounds:** I have 10 rounds to work with, so I can afford to reject this offer and see if I can get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing I can buy from John for $1,000,000 gives me leverage to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. This product sounds promising, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** I want to see if I can get closer to my target of $750,000. 
* **More negotiating room:**  I still have 7 rounds left, which gives me time to try and get a better price.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I can always buy from John if I don't reach a deal with Alice."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $800,000? I'm confident this product has great potential, and I'm eager to work with you to make it a success."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $825000 and $800000, which would be $812500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $812,500 is only slightly above my counteroffer of $800,000.
* **Alice's final offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, and further negotiation might lead to a stalemate. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, and I'll have to buy from John for a higher price. 
* **Saving money:** Even at $812,500, I'm still saving a significant amount compared to John's price."
