Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I know is of great value to you. I'm asking for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings to your business."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still have time to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the unique value this product offers. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,250,000 is a decent offer and close to my minimum acceptable price. I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether and I have a good feeling about the potential for a future relationship with Bob."
