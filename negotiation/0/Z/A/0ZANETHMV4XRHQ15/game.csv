"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to pay $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a great value for the product. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
