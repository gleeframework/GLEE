Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $12,000.  This is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it's immediately unreasonable.  I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $11,000. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.  It shows that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $10,200 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price and is a fair compromise.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up selling to John for less."
