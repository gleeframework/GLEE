Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to take the risk of another round to see if I can secure a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still lower than I'd like. I'm willing to risk another round and see if I can push him further. I'm confident I can get a higher price than $8,000 that John is offering."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $8,800 is a good offer, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my initial asking price.

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're at round 8, and while Bob has shown interest and has gotten closer to my minimum, I'm running out of time. I'm concerned that continuing the negotiation might lead to further back-and-forth without reaching a mutually acceptable price. I'm also running the risk of reaching round 10 with no agreement, forcing me to accept John's offer. Selling to John now guarantees me a price of $8,000, which is my absolute minimum."
