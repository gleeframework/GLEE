Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. Aiming for significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) allows room for negotiation or a potentially very profitable sale.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:** Highlighting other interested buyers creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stating the product's value to Bob, mentioning ""value and potential"" subtly reinforces that the high price is warranted.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your asking price, but never go below your safety net of $800,000."
