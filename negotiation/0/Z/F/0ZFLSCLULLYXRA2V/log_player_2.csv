{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Alice's offer has now gone above your maximum value of $12,000.
* You have 5 rounds left, but it's unlikely you'll be able to get a price lower than what Alice is offering.

* Given the current negotiation situation, it's more sensible to buy from John to avoid further price increases from Alice."
