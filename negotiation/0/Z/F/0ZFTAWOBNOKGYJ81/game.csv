"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,350,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm committed to finding a mutually agreeable price.  While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This price represents a significant savings for you, and a fair price for me.  Let's close this deal!",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,375,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can make a deal at this price.",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm committed to reaching a fair agreement. However, $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to offer $1,325,000, which is a significant step towards your minimum price and allows us both to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1325000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not quite at my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,375,000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a complimentary service package worth $25,000, which will give you an even better return on your investment. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",1375000.0,Alice,7,
