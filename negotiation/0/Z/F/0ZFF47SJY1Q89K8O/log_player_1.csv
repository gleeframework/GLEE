{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll love it. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is my initial offer. I'm starting high, hoping to get close to my minimum value. I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $60 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $80? It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 80}
