"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1800000 is far too high for me. I'm only interested in paying a maximum of $800000 for this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $800000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1500000. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits it offers.  Let's keep the negotiation moving forward.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate but $1500000 is still too high for me. My maximum budget for this product remains at $800000.  Let's work towards finding a middle ground.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This is a significant reduction from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I acknowledge your efforts to compromise, $1300000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm on my maximum offer of $800000.  Let's find a way to make this work.",800000.0,Bob,6,
