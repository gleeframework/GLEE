,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $150 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $130. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 again, but this is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll take the product.",125.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $128. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer.",128.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $128 is still a bit too high for me. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $125, and that's my final offer.",125.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you've gone as low as you can, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $125. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $129. This is my final offer, and if you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll accept your offer.",129.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $129 is still out of my budget. I've reached my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I think we've gone back and forth enough, and I'm going to have to pass on this deal. I'll consider buying the product from John for $100 instead.",0.0,Bob,10,
