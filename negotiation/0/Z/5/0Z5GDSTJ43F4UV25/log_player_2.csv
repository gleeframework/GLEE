"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950000. This is a fair price considering its value to me and its potential for your business. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's below the product's worth to her, it's still above your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $900000, which is a fair compromise given the value of the product. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $900,000 is still above my maximum budget of $800,000. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's not worth risking further negotiation. Buying from John ensures I get the product within my budget and avoids the potential for further delays or a complete breakdown in negotiations with Alice."
