"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you considering my product. While $6,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $9,000 to see if we can make this work.  Let's meet in the middle.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could you do $7,000?  That would work much better for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to come down to that price to get this product in your hands.",8000.0,Alice,5,
