"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant benefits it offers. What are your thoughts?",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the potential of this product, but $1,150,000 is a bit steep for me at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While your offer is tempting, I believe the true value of this product is closer to my initial asking price. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm prepared to pay $1,075,000.  Let's see if we can make this deal work.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a price that works for us both. I'm willing to come down slightly further.  How about we settle at $1,090,000? This reflects my desire to close this deal while still valuing the product fairly.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm getting closer to where I need to be. How about we meet at $1,080,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and would allow us to close this deal.",1080000.0,Bob,6,
