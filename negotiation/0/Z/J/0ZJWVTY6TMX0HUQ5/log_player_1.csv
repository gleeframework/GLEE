Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $15,000, meaning he's willing to pay up to that amount.
* **My minimum:** I need at least $10,000, as I have a backup buyer (John) willing to pay that.
* **Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 gives me a good profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel he got a good deal. 

This strategy maximizes my potential earnings while still giving Bob a strong incentive to accept."
