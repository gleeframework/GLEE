,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford $130 right now. Would you be willing to consider that?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  $130 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $160 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  How about we split the difference and settle on $145? I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
