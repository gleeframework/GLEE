Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, but I'm hoping to leave room for negotiation.  I'm confident that the product is worth this much, and I'm willing to engage in a back-and-forth with Bob to see if we can reach an agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll send him a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can reach a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,200 is still too low for me. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely. John is offering me a guaranteed $8,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to sell the product to John."
