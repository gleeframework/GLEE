{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $10,000, but leaves room for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll consider his counteroffer and the potential of selling to John as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering $10,750 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $10,000 than my initial offer, but I believe I can still get a better price. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $10,750 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about $10,900 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,900 is only $100 less than my last counteroffer of $11,000.  Considering that I can sell to John for $10,000, it's better to accept this offer and make a slightly lower profit than to risk losing the deal altogether."
