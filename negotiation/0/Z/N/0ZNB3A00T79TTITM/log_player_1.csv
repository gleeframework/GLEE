""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,450,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this is a fair price considering its potential benefits. Please let me know your decision at your earliest convenience."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum acceptable price. This price point also offers Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By encouraging a prompt decision, you incentivize Bob to accept without excessive deliberation, potentially leading him to prioritize securing the deal over negotiating a lower price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Having John as a backup buyer provides a safety net, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum price."
