"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is impressive, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $800,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",800000.0,Alice,3,
