"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since you have 10 rounds, there's no immediate need to buy from John. It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get Alice to come down in price.  Offering $8,000 is a substantial drop from $10,000, but it's still within a reasonable range for a product that I'm willing to spend up to $10,000 on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but it's still not a good deal for me.  I'm going to try to get her closer to my $8,000 counteroffer.  I have 7 rounds left, so there's still time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from $8,000 to $8,500.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still want a better price. I'm hoping she'll see this as a compromise and accept the offer."
