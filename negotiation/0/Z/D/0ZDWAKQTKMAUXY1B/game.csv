"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial price.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and features. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be honest, $1,000,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  How about we settle at $900,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value and my costs. I believe it's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",950000.0,Alice,5,
