{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than my usual asking price. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly lower than my minimum price:** This makes it more appealing to Bob.
* **It's still a good profit for me:** I'm making a decent profit, even at this lower price. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** I can still adjust the price if Bob counteroffers.

This strategy allows me to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving open the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product.  It's a fair offer considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting his offer would result in a huge loss for me.  While I could sell to John for $1,500,000 right now, I want to explore if I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum, hoping to find a middle ground."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I would prefer to receive. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I want to maximize my profit potential. I'll counter with a price that's closer to $900,000, hopefully finding a compromise that works for both of us."
