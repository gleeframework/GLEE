"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  However, the value this product represents to someone with your resources is significant. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,275,000?",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I still think $1,275,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,225,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for this product.",1225000.0,Bob,4,
