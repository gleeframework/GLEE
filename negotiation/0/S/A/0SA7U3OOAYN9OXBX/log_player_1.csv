Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it offers significant value, and at this price, you'd be getting a great deal."", ""product_price"": 14500} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible before resorting to John's guaranteed $10,000 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's perceived value ($15,000) allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Justify the Price:**  Highlighting the ""value"" aims to subtly anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a high level.

This strategy increases the chance of securing a deal closer to Bob's maximum valuation while still having John's offer as a safety net."
