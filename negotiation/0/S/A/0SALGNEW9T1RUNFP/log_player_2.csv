**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly sticking very close to her original offer and is unlikely to budge significantly. At this point, accepting her latest offer of $955,000 would only save $45,000 compared to buying from John for $1,000,000. 

Since we're in round 9 and running out of time, the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with no deal (forcing us to buy from John anyway) outweighs the potential savings of a few thousand dollars more."
