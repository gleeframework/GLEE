Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to leverage the fact that Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This will hopefully lead to a negotiation where we can find a price that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is higher than his stated value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm going to reject it and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm reducing my offer slightly from the initial price but still maintaining a significant margin. Hopefully, Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough.  I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially get stuck with a lower price. I'm confident that John is a sure bet for a much better deal."
