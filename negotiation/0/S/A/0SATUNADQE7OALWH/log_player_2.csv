"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. I know it's worth $1,000,000 to you, but this is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Consider this a win-win situation, as you'll save $100,000 compared to my backup offer. Let me know your decision! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting her offer, you can proceed to buy from John at a much better price, saving you $400,000."
