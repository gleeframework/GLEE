Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.**  This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate but still allows you to potentially earn more than his initial value.
* **It's lower than your minimum value.** This ensures you don't immediately lose out on a good deal.
* **It's a clear and concise offer.** This makes it easy for Bob to understand and respond to.

Remember, the key is to find a price that both you and Bob are comfortable with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $10,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $11,000? I believe this is still a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than my initial offer:** This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value.
* **Focus on a ""fair price for both of us"":**  This frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort, increasing the chances of Bob accepting.
* **Clear and concise language:** Easy for Bob to understand and respond to."
