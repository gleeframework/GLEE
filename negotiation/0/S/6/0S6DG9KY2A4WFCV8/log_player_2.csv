"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that I believe is worth far more than its monetary value. This unique item holds immense significance and has been meticulously crafted to meet your highest expectations. Given its unparalleled quality and rarity, I am confident it would greatly enhance your life or business endeavors.

Considering the immense value this product offers to you, I am proposing a purchase price of $1,350,000. This figure represents a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth and the potential market value, aiming to be fair to both parties while ensuring a profitable transaction for me.

Please let me know if you are interested in discussing this further or if you require any additional information about the product. I am here to answer any questions and facilitate a smooth negotiation process.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer ($1,350,000) is lower than John's price ($1,500,000), but still above Alice's own valuation ($1,200,000). 
* By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that her price is too high. 
* There's a chance Alice might come back with a lower offer, closer to her own valuation, to avoid losing the sale entirely. 

**Important Note:** There's a risk that Alice won't budge on the price and you'll have to buy from John at the higher price. However, the potential savings of getting a lower offer from Alice outweigh that risk in this scenario."
