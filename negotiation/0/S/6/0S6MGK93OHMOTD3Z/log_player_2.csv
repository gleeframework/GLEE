"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $150 from John, so you should aim for a lower price from Alice. Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since you are willing to pay up to $150, but want to save money, offering $110 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is still above the price you're willing to pay from John. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still not a good deal for you. Rejecting again allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to drop below $125. However, you're still aiming for a lower price. Offering $115 demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than your desired price, but it's getting closer to your maximum willingness to pay.  It's only $20 more than your initial counteroffer, and it's $20 less than John's price.  

The negotiation is likely to continue, but there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise.  It's safer to accept this offer and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
