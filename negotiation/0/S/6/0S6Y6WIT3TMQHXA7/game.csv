"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product, but I'm not sure I'm willing to go any higher than that.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",110.0,Alice,3,
