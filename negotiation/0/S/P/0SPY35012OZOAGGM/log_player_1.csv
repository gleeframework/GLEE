Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1000000} 

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold opening that allows for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident the product is worth at least this much to me, and I'm hoping Bob will see its value and be willing to pay a significant amount."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my floor price of $800,000, so I can't accept it. I'm willing to negotiate further, so I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to be flexible but still holding firm on my belief that the product is worth more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is exactly my floor price, and I'm not willing to risk further negotiation for a higher price.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum value for the product."
