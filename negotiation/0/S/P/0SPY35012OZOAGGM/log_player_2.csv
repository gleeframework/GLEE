It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price and leaves room for negotiation. Let's see if Alice is willing to come down."

I'm going to counteroffer with $800,000. This is a reasonable compromise between our previous offers, and I'm hopeful that Alice will find it acceptable."
