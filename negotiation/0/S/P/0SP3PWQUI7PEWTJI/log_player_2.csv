**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same price as John's.  Since you don't know the value of the product to Alice, you have no reason to believe she's offering a better deal.  There's no benefit to buying from Alice at the same price, and you might be able to get a lower price by negotiating with John later."
