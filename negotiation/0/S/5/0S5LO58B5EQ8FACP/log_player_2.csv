"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really value.  I'm asking $95 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is within your budget, you're aiming to save as much as possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to initiate a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  $85 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her perceived value of $80, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and polite, acknowledging Alice's offer while expressing your willingness to negotiate.
* **Goal:** This counteroffer aims to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $95 to $90, but it's still above your ideal price. You are still aiming to save as much money as possible and you have 7 rounds left.  By rejecting this offer you can try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $90 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? I'm really serious about buying this, and I think this price is fair considering your value for it."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $87.50 puts you halfway between your previous offer ($85) and Alice's latest offer ($90). This shows a willingness to compromise while still trying to get a better deal.
* **Emphasizing seriousness:** The message emphasizes your interest in buying the product, which might make Alice more inclined to accept a price closer to your desired range.
* **Fairness:** The message highlights the fact that the proposed price is still above Alice's perceived value, making it seem more reasonable."
