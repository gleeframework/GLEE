"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $149. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $149
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $149 is far above your $80 maximum price. 
* You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $80. 

It makes the most financial sense to buy from John and save the most money."
