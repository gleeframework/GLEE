Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This is a good starting point as it's less than what the product is worth to him, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $100 is better than selling to John, I can still likely get closer to my desired price.  I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105} 
```

I'm offering to sell the product to Bob for $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that will allow us both to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not the ideal price, it's only $2 less than my counteroffer, and it's still a good deal for me.  I'd rather close the deal now than risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price or having to sell to John."
