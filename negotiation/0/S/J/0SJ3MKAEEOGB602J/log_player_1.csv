Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's a significant investment, but I truly believe in its value and potential. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you aim to get as much above that as possible from Bob.
* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price of $19,000 sets a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, you're likely to end up with a price higher than what John is offering. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, giving you the opportunity to negotiate and potentially still secure a price significantly above $15,000.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you're comfortable with the possibility of Bob outright rejecting your initial offer. 
* You haven't provided information about Bob's negotiating style or financial limitations.  Adjusting the initial offer (perhaps slightly lower) might be wise if you have more information about Bob."
