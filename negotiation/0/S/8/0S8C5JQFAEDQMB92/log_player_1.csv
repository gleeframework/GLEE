Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. It is highly valuable and I believe it will greatly benefit you."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My primary goal is to get the highest price possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000 (John), I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Offering the product at $14,000 gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Value Emphasis:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to make a higher price more palatable.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have some reason to believe Bob might value the product highly enough to pay above $10,000.  If I had more information about Bob's budget or the product's specific value to him, I could adjust my offer accordingly."
