I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a fair starting point, considering the product is worth $12,000 to both of us. I believe there's room for negotiation, but I'm aiming to get as much as I can."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I won't accept a price that's significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. I'm hopeful we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It's a good deal considering the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of having to sell to John for less. I'll accept his offer."
