Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I'm still not comfortable with $8,850. Would you be willing to go down to $8,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While I could continue to push for a higher price, Bob seems anchored at a price point just below $8,800.  Accepting $8,750 guarantees a profit of $750 over my minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
