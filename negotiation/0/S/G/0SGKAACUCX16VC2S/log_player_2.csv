"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a unique opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer. It's above his maximum price point, and he can always get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  There's no reason to accept a higher price at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still hoping to get closer to the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise that still benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his maximum of $1,000,000.  Bob should continue negotiating with Alice in hopes of getting a better price.  If he's unsuccessful, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm ready to close the deal today at $1,000,000. This price would be mutually beneficial and ensure a quick and smooth transaction."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to get the price down, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to get the deal done, so I'm offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's maximum price point of $1,000,000.  At this point, it's better for Bob to cut his losses and purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with Alice only risks wasting time and potentially ending up with a worse deal."
