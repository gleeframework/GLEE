Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know would be very valuable to you. I'm willing to part with it for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  By offering the product at $14,000, you leave some room for negotiation (should Bob try to haggle) while still securing a price significantly higher than your minimum. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob sees value in the deal and is more likely to accept."
