{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in.  I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to respond.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  $12,000 is a good starting point. It's closer to my minimum value ($15,000) than to Bob's perceived value ($8,000), giving me more room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message conveys a willingness to discuss the price, encouraging Bob to counteroffer. 
* **Plan B:**  The knowledge that I can sell to John for $15,000 gives me a strong bargaining position. If Bob's counteroffers are too low, I can always walk away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low.**  While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000.
* **I have a strong bargaining position.** I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not desperate to accept Bob's offer. 
* **Counteroffering is a good strategy.** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer closer to my desired price and potentially reach a compromise.

**Next Steps:**

I will send Bob a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $12,000 or higher."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $9,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message remains friendly and encourages further negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  While I'm willing to lower my price, $10,500 is still significantly above Bob's initial offer and closer to my desired price. 

**Strategic Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Sale:**  This offer balances the potential for a sale with maintaining a reasonable profit. 
* **Encouraging Acceptance:**  The offer is more likely to be accepted by Bob than my previous offer, but still provides me with a good profit margin.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000 if Bob's counteroffers remain too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference again and go with $10,000? It's a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle Again:** This offer continues the pattern of compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer ($10,500) and Bob's offer ($9,500). 
* **Emphasis on Compromise:** The message highlights the ""fair compromise"" aspect, appealing to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Positive Language:** The message remains positive and encourages Bob to consider the offer. 

**Strategic Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Profit and Sale:** This offer balances the potential for a sale with maintaining a profit margin that is closer to my desired price.
* **Creating a Sense of Urgency:** By repeatedly offering to split the difference, I create a sense that this may be the last opportunity for a deal.
* **Prepared to Walk Away:**  If Bob continues to refuse to budge, I'm still prepared to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our last discussion, so how about we go with $9,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.**  While it's getting closer, $9,250 is still significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result.**  At this point, Bob has shown a clear reluctance to budge, and further rounds of negotiation are likely to be unproductive. 
* **John offers a much better deal.**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, which is significantly more than Bob's current offer.

**Decision:**

It's in my best interest to sell the product to John for $15,000. This guarantees me a sale at a price that meets my minimum requirements and significantly exceeds Bob's final offer."
