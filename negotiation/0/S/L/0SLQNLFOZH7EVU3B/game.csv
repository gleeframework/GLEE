"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $8,500? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know your thoughts.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,500?  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?",7500.0,Alice,5,
