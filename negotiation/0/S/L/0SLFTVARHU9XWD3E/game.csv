"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $10,500 for this. It's still a great deal for you, considering the value to you. Let's find a compromise.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your position, I am hoping we can find a middle ground. Could we possibly agree on $10,000 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still obtaining a valuable asset.",10000.0,Bob,4,
