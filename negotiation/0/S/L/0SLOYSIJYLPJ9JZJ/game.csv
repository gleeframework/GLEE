"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you and a good price for me. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm willing to make a deal at that price.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great price for you, and it gives me a bit more room to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $92. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price.",92.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price.  However, $92 is still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm offering $93.50.  This is a great price for you, and it's a fair deal for me.",93.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm close to your price, but I'm still looking for a bit more savings. I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. I think it's a fair price for both of us and I'm ready to make a deal.",92.5,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to meet you at $93.  That's my final offer, let's make this deal happen.",93.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm trying to be reasonable, but $93 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $92. I think it's a fair price for both of us and I'm hoping we can make a deal.",92.0,Bob,8,
