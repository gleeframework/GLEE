"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 15000} 

I'm starting with a high offer to gauge Bob's interest.  Since I don't know his valuation, I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my price in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a slightly better price from Bob.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly to $13,500.  This is still above my minimum but shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $12,500, which is $500 above my minimum.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  it's a reasonable compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit, and I'm not sure if we'll get any closer with further negotiation."
