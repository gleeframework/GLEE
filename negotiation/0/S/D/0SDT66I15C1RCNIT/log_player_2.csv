"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $120, and both Alice and John are offering the product at that price, you can reject Alice's offer and buy from John. This is because you have no incentive to buy from Alice at the same price when you have an alternative option."
