"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but only if it's a much better price. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $65 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, though! I'm thinking of a price of $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $90 is still a bit beyond my price range. I could possibly do $75.  Would that work for you?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $75 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though! I'm thinking of a price of $85. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but I have a strict budget. I can do $80, which is a fair price.  If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to go with another seller.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but $80 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $82.50. What do you think?",82.5,Alice,7,
