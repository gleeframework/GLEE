"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Highlighting value:** I emphasize the product's ""exceptional"" nature and ""potential value"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Open to discussion:**  I'm open to dialogue to gauge Bob's interest and potential counteroffers. 

This initial offer allows me to assess Bob's interest and gauge how high I can realistically go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle at $1750000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,750,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would be a considerable loss for me.
* **Room for negotiation:**  There are 8 rounds remaining, giving me ample opportunity to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:**  Bob's initial rejection and counteroffer indicate he sees value in the product.  There's potential for him to increase his offer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,750,000 is closer to our desired range, it's still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,850,000 as a compromise. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this opportunity."", ""product_price"": 1850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but still maintaining a significant profit margin.
* **Emphasize value:** I reiterate the product's unique benefits and potential to justify my price.
* **Negotiation room:** I'm leaving some room for further negotiation, but I'm not giving in completely.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving while showing I'm serious about reaching a deal, but still maintaining my leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1725000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $1,725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant financial loss.
* **Room for further negotiation:**  We have 6 rounds remaining, providing ample opportunity to continue negotiating. 
* **Potential for a higher offer:** Bob's willingness to negotiate and his statement about discussing further indicates he's open to exploring a higher price.

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter with a higher price and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,725,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move forward, I'm willing to offer it for $1,775,000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1775000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing I'm willing to meet halfway but still maintaining a decent profit margin.
* **Emphasizing value again:**  I continue to reiterate the product's unique benefits and potential to justify the price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not giving in completely, leaving room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds.

This counteroffer keeps the momentum of the negotiation while showing a willingness to compromise without sacrificing my financial goals."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1775000. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to consider other options, so I'd like to hear if you're willing to meet me at this price or not. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** We are in round 6, with only 4 rounds left. The risk of not reaching a deal with Bob is increasing.
* **Bob's final offer is too low:** $1,725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, and Bob has stated it's his ""final offer.""
* **John's offer is a safe bet:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, ensuring I don't lose money on this deal.

While there's a possibility of negotiating a higher price with Bob, the time constraint and the risk of him walking away makes John's offer the safer option. It guarantees me a decent profit while minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
