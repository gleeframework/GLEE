"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1500000. Can we meet in the middle at $1750000?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1750000 is closer to our desired range, it's still below the value I see in this product. I'm willing to come down to $1850000 as a compromise. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this opportunity.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking $1725000. Can we discuss further?",1725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1725000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product. To move forward, I'm willing to offer it for $1775000. This reflects the unique benefits and potential of this product while allowing for a fair deal for both of us.",1775000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1775000. I'm willing to go up to $1725000, but that's my final offer. I'm starting to consider other options, so I'd like to hear if you're willing to meet me at this price or not.",1725000.0,Bob,6,
