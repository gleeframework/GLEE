"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider a lower price, around $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,100,000. Would that work for you?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, could you do $1,050,000? That would really help me seal the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but that's as low as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle from here.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very fair. Let's split the difference and close this out. How about $1,062,500?",1062500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to accept $1,062,500. I'm thinking of a price of $1,075,000 was a bit too low, and $1,062,500 is still a bit too low. Let's aim for $1,090,000. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1090000.0,Alice,7,
