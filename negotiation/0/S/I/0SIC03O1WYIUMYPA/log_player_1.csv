"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than the product's worth to Bob, but I'm confident he'll be willing to negotiate.  I want to see how far he's willing to go to get the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,100,000. This is still a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant step down from my initial offer. I'm hoping this will show Bob I'm willing to compromise while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is tempting, I'm still not convinced Bob won't go higher. I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars before I consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,050,000. This is closer to what the product is worth to Bob, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm still prepared to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm not thrilled about leaving a little money on the table, I'm concerned that Bob is not going to meet my price. It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk ending up with nothing. It's time to secure a guaranteed sale."
