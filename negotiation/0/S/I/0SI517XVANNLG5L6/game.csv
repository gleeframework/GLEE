"Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price considering your profit margin and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows me a reasonable profit.  I believe this is a fair compromise given the value the product brings to you. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000, which is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and my desired purchase price.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
