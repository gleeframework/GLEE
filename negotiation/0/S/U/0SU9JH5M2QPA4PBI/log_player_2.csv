"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $900,000 saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While the product is worth $800,000 to Alice, your value is higher at $1,000,000. This means there's still a potential for profit if you resell the product later."
