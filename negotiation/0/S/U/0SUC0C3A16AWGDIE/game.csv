"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm afraid $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $16000. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $16000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $14000. Can you consider that?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $17000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",17000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as high as $17000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, so I'm counteroffering at $13500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'm counteroffering at $16500. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle.",16500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $16500. I'm willing to go up to $14250, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",14250.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with $14250. I'm willing to make one last concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $16000, but I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your extras, but I'm afraid I've already decided to consider buying the product from John for $10000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to negotiate with you, but I need to be realistic about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll be buying from John.",12500.0,Bob,10,
