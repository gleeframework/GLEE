"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason: While $130 is less than the $150 John is asking, there's still room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $115? Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: $122 is still below your $150 limit and closer to your desired price. There's a chance Alice might come down further, but the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John for a higher price is too great."
