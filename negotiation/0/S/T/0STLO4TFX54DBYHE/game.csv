"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1200000 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $900000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to sell at $900000. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $950000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell at $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $950000, which would be $1025000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1025000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at that price?",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not ready to sell at $975000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1100000 and $975000, which would be $1025000, but I'll add a small concession to sweeten the deal. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1010000. This is my final offer. What do you think?",1010000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the concession, but I'm still not ready to commit to $1010000. I'd be willing to go up to $980000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at that price?",980000.0,Bob,8,

,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $980000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. I'm not willing to go any higher, so I'm making a final offer of $980000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to explore other options.",980000.0,Bob,10,
