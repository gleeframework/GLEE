Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm prepared to offer $850,000, which reflects a fair compromise and allows me to stay within my price range. I'm confident this deal would be mutually beneficial. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is too far below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This reflects a significant compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'll gain from this product."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,025,000 is still outside my comfortable price range.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000, which represents a significant move on my end. I believe this offer is fair and reflects the product's value while staying within my budget.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but $900,000 is still too low. I'll counteroffer again, but I need to start considering John's offer if Bob doesn't budge significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $900,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'm willing to consider  $975,000 as my final offer.  This is a significant compromise for me, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're at your bottom line, but $975,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  To show my commitment to this deal, I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise for both of us. Let's finalize this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob is unlikely to move much higher, and while $950,000 is a decent offer, I have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John. It makes the most financial sense to sell to John at this point."
