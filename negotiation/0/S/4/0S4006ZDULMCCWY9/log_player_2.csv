"Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $12,000 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $20,000.  It's much more beneficial to try and negotiate with Alice.  If that fails, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for negotiation. Alice may be willing to come down, or if not, it gives me a clear understanding of how far apart we are. I can then adjust my counteroffers accordingly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down slightly, but the price is still too high for me.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price point.  If that fails, I can always go with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $13,000. This is still significantly lower than Alice's offer of $17,500, but it shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price closer to my target of $12,000. This should give Alice more incentive to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to my desired price of $12,000, I still believe there is room for negotiation.  If I reject the offer, I can potentially get Alice down even further. If I'm unsuccessful, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $14,000, continuing to demonstrate my willingness to compromise while keeping in mind my goal of $12,000. This is a good middle ground between our current offers. If Alice accepts, I save $2,000 compared to John's offer."
