"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point, as it's more than what the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm hoping to reach a compromise quickly without risking losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While I'd like to close the deal, I'm not willing to accept such a low price. I believe there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $100. This is still above what the product is worth to Bob, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, this price is attractive enough for Bob to accept and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm running out of rounds, I'm still going to reject Bob's offer. $85 is too low for me, and I'm not desperate enough to sell at a loss. I'm hoping that by rejecting this offer, I can push Bob to increase his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $95. This is a further reduction from my previous offer, demonstrating my willingness to compromise. While I'm approaching my minimum acceptable price, I'm still holding out for a better deal. Hopefully, Bob will recognize that we're nearing a compromise point and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $120.  We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers keep getting lower. I'm not confident that I'll be able to get a price I'm comfortable with if I continue negotiating with Bob.  John is a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price, so it's the best option at this point."
