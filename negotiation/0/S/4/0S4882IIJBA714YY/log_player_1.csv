Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  This is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Alice knows Bob's maximum valuation is $8,000, but she also knows she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John. Therefore, she starts with a high offer to see if she can maximize her profit beyond John's offer. 
* **Creating Urgency:** By mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" and listing the product publicly, Alice creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one strategy.  Alice could have chosen to start with a lower price and negotiate up. 
* The success of this strategy depends on Bob's negotiation skills and risk tolerance."
