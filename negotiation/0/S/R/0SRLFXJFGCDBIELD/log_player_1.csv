Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'd be interested in.  Based on its value and market potential, I'm offering it to you for $25,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 25000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's a good strategy to start with a higher price to leave room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning ""unique"" and ""market potential"" subtly hints at the product's worth without revealing your minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message ends with an invitation for Bob to respond, making it clear that the price is negotiable.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:** Depending on Bob's response, you'll need to adjust your strategy. If he rejects, you'll have to decide whether to counter or switch to John. 
* **Understanding Bob:** The key is to gauge Bob's interest and try to understand his perceived value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $15000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Minimum:** Bob's offer is at your minimum acceptable price.  
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room to negotiate. You can try to get closer to your desired price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will counter Bob's offer with a slightly higher price, aiming for a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $18,000?  This price reflects the unique value of the product and allows us both to find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer of $18,000 is a middle ground between your initial offer and Bob's. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Reinforcing the ""unique value"" of the product reminds Bob of its potential worth.
* **Mutually Agreeable:**  The message focuses on finding a solution that benefits both parties.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's Response:**  Observe Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he accepts, you've successfully negotiated a higher price. If he rejects, you need to decide whether to counter again or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the unique value of the product, I would like to propose a price of $16500. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $16,500 is significantly closer to my desired price range than John's offer. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Further negotiation might not yield a much higher price, and there's a risk of Bob backing out entirely.
* **Time and Effort:** Accepting the offer saves time and avoids potential complications of further negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalization:** I will accept Bob's offer and proceed with the transaction."
