"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1100000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1000000.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $900000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, so I'll offer you the product for $980000. This is the lowest I can go.",980000.0,Alice,5,
