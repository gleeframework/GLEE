{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to get closer to the product's true value to Bob. I'm also adding a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm hoping to get a higher price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my absolute minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to $140. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130? Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm counteroffering with $130, which is halfway between my minimum and my initial offer. I'm still hoping to get a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. The message is also friendly and encourages a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $130 is your minimum, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's only $5 more than what I could get from John, it's still above my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from Bob in the next round.  It's also worth considering the potential for future sales with Bob if he's happy with this purchase."
