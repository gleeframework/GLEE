"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to me ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, hoping to encourage him to consider it. 
* **Round 1 strategy:**  In the first round, it's important to establish a starting point. I'm not expecting Bob to accept this price, but it sets the stage for the negotiations to come."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my desired value.
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John for $100 is an option, but I want to see if I can get closer to my target price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I can do $95.  Let's split the difference and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering $95, which is closer to his offer and still above my minimum. 
* **Urgency:** I'm emphasizing the desire to make a deal, hoping to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Building rapport:**  I'm trying to build a positive relationship with Bob by being reasonable and showing a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100, and we've already had several rounds of negotiation.
* **Time is running out:** With only 6 rounds left, the chances of getting a better price from Bob are getting slimmer.
* **Guaranteed profit:**  Selling to John for $100 is a sure thing, ensuring I get a profit on the product. It's the best option to secure a positive outcome in this situation."
