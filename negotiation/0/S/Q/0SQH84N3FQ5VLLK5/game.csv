"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $15000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $10000 right now. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a compromise at $12500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being willing to compromise, Alice. However, $12500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to stick with my offer of $10000. If you're not able to accept that, I'll need to look at other options.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $12000. This is my final compromise, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Alice,5,
