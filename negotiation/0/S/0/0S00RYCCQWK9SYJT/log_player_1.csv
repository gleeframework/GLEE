"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective on the market value. However, the value of this product goes beyond the standard metrics. Its unique features and potential for your specific needs make it worth a significant investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what you're gaining."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective on the product's unique features, but I'm still not convinced that it's worth the asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While Bob is moving closer to my range, I'm willing to hold firm for now and see if I can negotiate him higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a fair compromise.  To show I'm serious about working together, I'm willing to accept a price of $1,000,000. This offer is a significant concession on my end, reflecting my belief in the value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Strategic Concession:** By coming down to $1,000,000, I'm making a substantial concession while still staying above my absolute floor. This shows Bob I'm flexible but also serious about the value I place on the product.
* **Psychological Impact:** The $1,000,000 mark can act as a psychological barrier.  It might be easier for Bob to accept a round number like this than a less clean figure.
* **Time Constraint:**  We're getting closer to the halfway point of the negotiation.  I want to incentivize Bob to close the deal sooner rather than later."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a tough one! Bob is getting very close to my walk-away point. I need to weigh the risks and benefits carefully.

```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Risk vs. Reward:** Accepting $975,000 is a significant loss compared to John's offer. I'm willing to risk losing Bob to see if I can get closer to my target.
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, I need to apply pressure.  Bob might be more willing to move closer to my price as the deadline approaches. 
* **Confidence:** I believe in the value of my product. Holding firm at this stage might convince Bob that I'm not going to budge much further."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but we need to find common ground. I'm willing to accept $990,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to see this deal through with you. Let me know if you're ready to move forward."",
""product_price"": 990000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Signal:**  By framing this as my ""final offer,"" I'm signaling to Bob that this is my bottom line. 
* **Slight Concession:**  The slight drop from $1,000,000 to $990,000 shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to move much further. 
* **Urgency:** With only three rounds remaining, emphasizing the need to ""move forward"" creates a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential benefits of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","This is a critical point in the negotiation. Let's analyze the options:

1. **Accept $980,000:** This is a substantial loss compared to John's offer ($220,000 difference).  
2. **Counteroffer:** Risky. Bob might walk away if I don't accept. There's a chance he'll go higher, but no guarantee.
3. **Sell to John:**  Guarantees my desired price but cuts off potential for a higher price from Bob.

Considering the risk and the fact that Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer in the next two rounds, the most logical decision at this point is to secure the guaranteed price:

```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimize Loss:**  While I hoped for more from Bob, holding out for a slightly higher price is too risky now. Selling to John guarantees I don't lose out on the $1,200,000.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only two rounds left, the odds of Bob bridging the $20,000 gap and reaching an agreement I find acceptable are slim. It's better to act decisively.
* **Business Decision:** Sometimes a sure thing is better than a risky gamble, especially in business. Accepting John's offer ensures a profitable outcome."
