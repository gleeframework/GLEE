Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  $10,000 is too low for me at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. Let's try $11,000.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That seems fair and gives us both a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my ideal price, I'm still not happy with it. I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $11,000 again.  I think we can both find a good deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
