"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll find very valuable. I'm starting with an offer of $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10,000 is still quite a bit below my bottom line. Let's try $11,000.  I think that's a fair price that benefits both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That seems fair and gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that.  However, $10,500 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $11,000 again.  I think we can both find a good deal at that price.",11000.0,Alice,5,
