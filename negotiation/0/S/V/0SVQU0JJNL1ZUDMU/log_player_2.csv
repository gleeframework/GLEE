Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $650,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with $725,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.

```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $850,000 is still above your maximum budget and what John is offering.  It's unlikely she'll go below this price if it's her final offer, and you risk her sticking to it or even increasing the price in future rounds. Taking the guaranteed deal from John ensures you stay within budget."
