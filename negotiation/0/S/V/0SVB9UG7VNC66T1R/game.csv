"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $150 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer it to you for $175. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",175.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am still looking for something closer to my budget. Could we possibly agree on $160?",160.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $160. I can offer you a compromise at $180, which is still a great deal considering the product's value. Let me know if that works for you.",180.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I can see you're willing to pay a bit more, so I'm willing to meet you halfway between $170 and my previous offer of $180. How about we settle on $175? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",175.0,Alice,7,
