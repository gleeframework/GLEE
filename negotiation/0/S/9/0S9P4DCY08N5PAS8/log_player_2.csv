"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business and I'm happy to offer it to you for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a great deal for Bob. However, it's still worth exploring if Bob can get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to go lower to make the sale, and Bob can save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a great start, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000. I believe this product has great value, but I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $750,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and only $50,000 above Bob's target price of $700,000.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and him having to buy from John at a much higher price outweighs the potential savings.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price without taking unnecessary risks."
