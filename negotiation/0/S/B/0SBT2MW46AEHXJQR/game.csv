"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident this price reflects its worth. I'm open to discussing your thoughts, but I'm also prepared to sell to another buyer if we can't reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for the product. I understand it's valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly below what the product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I can tell this product is important to you, and I respect that.  To be honest, $750,000 is a little too tight for me still. Could we settle at $700,000? That's the highest I can go. ",700000.0,Bob,4,
