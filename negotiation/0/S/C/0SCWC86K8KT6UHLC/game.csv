"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $100 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $60? I think that's a fair price.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a good deal for you considering the product's value.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $75 just doesn't work for me. How about $80?  That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close this deal.",80.0,Alice,5,
