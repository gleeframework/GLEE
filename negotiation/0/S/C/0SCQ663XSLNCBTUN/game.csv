"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $135?  It's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? It's getting close to the price I'm comfortable with.",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price. However, $132 is still just a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $134. It's a fair compromise, and we can finalize this deal. What do you say?",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $134. Would you be willing to meet me at $131? It's the last offer I'm willing to make, and I'd really like to finalize this deal.",131.0,Bob,6,
