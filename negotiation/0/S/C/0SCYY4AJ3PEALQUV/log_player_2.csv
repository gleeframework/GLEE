Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you to consider?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the minimum price you're willing to pay, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

Alice is unlikely to go below $12,000 and is now holding firm at $14,000. It's time to cut losses and secure the product from John at the known price of $8,000."
