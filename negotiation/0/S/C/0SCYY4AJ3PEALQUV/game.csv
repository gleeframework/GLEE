"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is a little too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 was a bit steep for you, and I appreciate your willingness to make a counteroffer. However, I'm afraid $6,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12,000. Is this a more reasonable price for you to consider?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. While $12,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me. How about we try $8,000? I believe that's a fair offer for both of us.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $8,000 is the minimum price you're willing to pay, but I'm still not getting the value I'm looking for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to take a slightly firmer stance and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is my best and final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Alice,5,
