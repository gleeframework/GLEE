"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit surprised by the initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and finding middle ground is certainly important to me.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe the value this product brings justifies a higher number. How about we settle at $1,200,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'd like to propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
