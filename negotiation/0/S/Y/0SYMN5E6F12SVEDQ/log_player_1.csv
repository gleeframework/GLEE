{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).** This gives you room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000).** This gives Bob an incentive to accept.

By starting with this offer, you create a good foundation for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and your desired profit margin. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum acceptable price, you can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  You have already established a higher price point, and Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate. Rejecting his offer will allow you to counter with a price closer to your initial offer, potentially leading to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, and it's closer to your previous counteroffer of $900,000.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a slightly higher price, but it's likely that Bob won't budge much further.  Accepting his offer ensures a quick and profitable sale, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and the possibility of Bob backing out altogether."
