"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still allows you to make a significant profit, and it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000. This would be a fair compromise, allowing both of us to walk away with a reasonable deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
