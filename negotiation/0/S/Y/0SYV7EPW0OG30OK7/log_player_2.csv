Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's price. There's room for negotiation to get a better deal from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1,050,000?

Alice is coming down, but we're still $50,000 away from John's price. It's worth one more counter-offer to see if we can get closer to $1,000,000."

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and we're now at the point where the potential savings are outweighed by the risk of losing the deal altogether. John's offer of $1,000,000 is a guaranteed saving compared to Alice's current price."
