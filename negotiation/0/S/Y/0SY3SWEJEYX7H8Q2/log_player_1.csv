Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  How I (Alice) proceed will depend entirely on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
