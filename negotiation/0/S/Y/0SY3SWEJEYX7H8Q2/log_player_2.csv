"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than her own valuation, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. By rejecting the offer, Bob can buy the product from John for a lower price, achieving his goal."
