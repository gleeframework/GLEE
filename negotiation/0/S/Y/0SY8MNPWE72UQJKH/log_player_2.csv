# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it's a fantastic deal and worth every penny. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

 Alice's offer is significantly higher than your budget and John's offer. It's best to negotiate for a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $75 is too low for this item.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair offer for both of us.

While closer to your budget, Alice's offer is still significantly higher than John's. There's room to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the difference is now small enough that it's worth taking John's offer to guarantee the price you want."
