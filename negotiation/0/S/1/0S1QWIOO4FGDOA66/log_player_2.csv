"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $10,000 to you. I would like to propose a deal at a price of $9,500. This is a special offer considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's offer, Bob can likely do better.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  This is still a good deal for you, considering your own valuation, and it gives me some breathing room within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to consider your offer at $8,500. However, due to the high value of the product, I would like to request an additional payment plan option. Could we discuss a payment plan over time? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price:** The price of $8,500 is exactly what Bob was aiming for in his counteroffer, so it's a great deal for him.
* **Payment Plan:** While the payment plan is mentioned, it's not a deal-breaker. Bob can potentially negotiate the terms of the payment plan in the next round if needed.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Buying from John for $10,000 would be a worse outcome.

By accepting the offer, Bob secures the product at his desired price and can address any payment plan concerns in the next round."
