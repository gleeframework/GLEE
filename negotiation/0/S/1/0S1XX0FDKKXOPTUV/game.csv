"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 to make this deal work.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $12,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but I'm still hoping to land a bit lower.  Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price.  $11,000 is closer, but I'm still not comfortable going that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, $11,500 is a fair compromise. However, I have a strict budget for this purchase. Would you be willing to settle at $11,200? That's the most I can offer at this time.",11200.0,Bob,6,
