Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm hoping to find out what the product is worth to him, while still ensuring I get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm happy with the $8,000 price, I believe I can get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $9,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still hoping to earn more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While I'd still prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $8,500 is a good deal and  better than selling to John for $8,000.  It's also likely that continuing to negotiate will just take more time and could result in a lower price."
