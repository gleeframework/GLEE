Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for it.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}

Round 4

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While it's tempting to sell to John for $8,000, I'm still hoping to get a better price from Bob. I'll continue negotiating with him."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 simply wouldn't cover my costs. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,000. This is my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with $8000. I'd be willing to pay $7500 for the product.

I'm going to sell to John for $8,000. While I'd like to get a bit more, it seems Bob is not willing to budge further. It's better to secure the sale at a fair price than risk losing both Bob and John."
