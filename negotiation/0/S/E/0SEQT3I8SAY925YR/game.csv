"Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I appreciate the value it brings, but my budget allows me to only consider offers within the range of $500,000 to $700,000. I hope we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your budget constraints, the $650,000 offer significantly undervalues the product's true worth.
