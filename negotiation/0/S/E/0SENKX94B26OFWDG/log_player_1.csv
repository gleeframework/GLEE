Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and presents a significant return on investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 allows for some potential negotiation down, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value and potential return on investment, justifying the high price.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $800,000, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and the potential for future interactions with Bob, you might adjust the offer."
