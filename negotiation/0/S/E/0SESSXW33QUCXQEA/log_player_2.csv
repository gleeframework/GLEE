{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay no more than $80, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. It's better to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price.  You are willing to pay a maximum of $80, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $120 is still too much. I'm firm at $80. If we can't agree on that, I'll have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $120. I'll give you a slight concession, so I'll sell it to you for $110. It's the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than the $80 you're willing to pay.  There are only a few rounds left, and there's no guarantee she'll accept your counteroffer. It's best to move forward and buy the product from John, ensuring you get the price you want."
