"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the effort I've put into it.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $950,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $875,000?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to reduce the price to $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own profit margin.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I understand this is your lowest price, but it's still a bit beyond my ideal budget.  Would you consider $900,000? It's a significant purchase, and that price point would make it much more manageable for me.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant purchase for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional services worth $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get the product and the services for a total of $920,000. I think this is a fair compromise.",920000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the added services, that's very generous of you.  However, to be completely transparent, those particular services aren't something I need right now.  To make this work, I'd need to stick to my budget of $900,000.  Would you consider that final offer?",900000.0,Bob,8,
