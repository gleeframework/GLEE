Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to reduce the price to $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to you and my own profit margin.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $900,000 is a significant purchase for you, but I'm still not willing to go below $925,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some additional services worth $5,000 to sweeten the deal. This way, you'll get the product and the services for a total of $920,000. I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

**Reasoning:**

While the added services are a nice touch, they don't significantly change the core value proposition.  We're still essentially haggling over $20,000.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge further, especially with fewer rounds left."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the added services, that's very generous of you.  However, to be completely transparent, those particular services aren't something I need right now.  To make this work, I'd need to stick to my budget of $900,000.  Would you consider that final offer?"", ""product_price"": 900000}"
