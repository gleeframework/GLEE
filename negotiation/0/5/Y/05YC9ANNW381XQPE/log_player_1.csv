Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to get even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 tempts Bob with a price higher than his perceived value ($100) but still represents a significant discount.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this initial offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downwards, still exceeding the $150 I'm guaranteed from John."
