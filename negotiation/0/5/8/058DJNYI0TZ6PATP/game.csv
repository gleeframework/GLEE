"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500.  This is a good deal for both of us, so let's see if we can agree on this price.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position.  I'm still really interested in the product, but $9,500 is pushing my limit.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
