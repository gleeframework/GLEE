"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay $120 for the product, and John is offering it at that price, there's no need to negotiate with Alice.  You can get the product for the same price from John without the hassle."
