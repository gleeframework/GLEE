"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's well below its market value, and it gives you the chance to acquire something truly unique.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

While $12,000 is a decent offer, there's a good chance Alice might be willing to go lower. Rejecting her initial offer could lead to a better counter-offer.  I'm willing to risk going up to $15,000 with John if necessary."
