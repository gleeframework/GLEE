"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to consider a price of $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,"I understand your position, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. What are your thoughts?"
