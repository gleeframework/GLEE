"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $800,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price. It's worth exploring counteroffers before committing."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'd be willing to consider a price of $650,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 650000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer represents a significant discount from Alice's initial price. It shows I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.  This price is also significantly lower than what John is offering, so it's still within my budget and gives Alice a good opportunity to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer. This price is closer to my target range, and it's still a better deal than buying from John.  While I could potentially push for a lower price, accepting this offer ensures I get the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
