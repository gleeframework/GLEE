Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to do $150? It's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is unlikely to budge:** Alice has stated that $150 is her final offer. She's already come down from $200, and it's unlikely she'll go any lower.
* **John offers a better deal:** You can buy the product for $120 from John, which is your maximum price and a significant saving compared to Alice's offer.
* **No guarantee of a better deal with Alice:** Even if you continue negotiating with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll get her to lower her price further. It's better to take the guaranteed saving with John."
