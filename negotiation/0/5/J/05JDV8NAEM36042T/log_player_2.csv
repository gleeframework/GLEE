"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a starting price of $15,000. I believe in its value and think it would be a great asset to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's even more than you value the product. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $15,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for the product."", ""product_price"": 8000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a starting offer significantly below your target price. This gives you room to maneuver upwards.
* **Signaling Interest:** While $8,000 is low, it shows Alice you're serious about buying but need a more reasonable price.
* **Leaving Room:** This offer leaves a significant gap between our offer and both Alice's asking price and our maximum budget.  This allows for back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I appreciate your offer, $8,000 is too low for me.  Could you do $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is coming down, but $13,000 is still above our budget. We need to show we're willing to negotiate but also willing to walk away if needed. Let's see if we can get her closer to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  However, $13,000 is still a stretch for my budget.  How about $9,500? That's a fair offer, considering its real value."", ""product_price"": 9500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Increase:** We're increasing our offer by $1,500, signaling that we're willing to compromise.
* **Below Budget but Fair:** $9,500 is still below our absolute limit, giving us some wiggle room while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Justification:** Mentioning ""real value"" subtly reminds Alice that her initial valuation might be inflated."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your position. Let's meet in the middle, how about $11,000? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is firm:**  Her language (""final offer"") suggests she's unlikely to go much lower. 
* **Too close to our limit:** $11,000 is only a $1,000 savings over John's price. 
* **Not worth the risk:** Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better result, and we risk Alice sticking to $11,000.

It's been a good negotiation attempt, but John's guaranteed price of $10,000 is now the more attractive option."
