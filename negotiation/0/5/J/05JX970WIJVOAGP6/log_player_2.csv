"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $140. This allows us both to benefit from the transaction. If this offer suits you, please let me know and we can proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value:**  You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice is asking for $140. 
* **John's offer is your fallback:**  While you'd prefer a lower price, John's offer is within your budget and guarantees you'll get the product.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away and buy from someone else. This might lead Alice to counter with a lower price, but even if she doesn't, you still have the option to buy from John."
