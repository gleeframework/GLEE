"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,001. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is just a little above your maximum price point.  There's room to negotiate and get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive opening:** This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, showing that you're serious about getting a good deal. 
* **Justified reasoning:** The message provides a rationale for the lower offer, focusing on your desire to find a fair price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends on a positive note, acknowledging the need for compromise and expressing willingness to continue the discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good deal:** Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is within your budget and significantly lower than her initial offer. This is a good deal considering your maximum budget is $1,200,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk of Alice becoming more resistant or the negotiation taking longer.  
* **Potential for better offer from John:**  You have the option to buy from John for $1,200,000, so accepting Alice's offer secures a better deal."
