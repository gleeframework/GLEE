"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's a game-changer in its industry, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the asking price of $2000000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid $500000 is below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1250000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I understand the value you see in the product, but I'm still working within my budget constraints. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $800000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is the absolute lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value this product brings. If this doesn't work for you, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
