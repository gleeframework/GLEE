Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I value highly. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 
 
**Reasoning:**  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000, I have a strong fallback position. Starting with a high offer of $1,800,000 allows me to potentially capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product.  

This strategy aims to:

* **Test Bob's willingness to pay:**  A high initial offer helps me gauge how much Bob is truly willing to spend.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, it sets the stage for a negotiation where I can potentially still secure a price well above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value you place on this product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my initial ask.  Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Signal flexibility but maintain value:**  I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of a substantial loss.
* **Guide the negotiation towards a higher price:** My next counteroffer will aim for a number closer to my desired outcome while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to move from my initial price, but $1,500,000 is still below what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000?"", ""product_price"": 1650000}

**Reasoning:** 

* **Show willingness to compromise:**  By moving closer to Bob's offer, I demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a strong position:** The counteroffer of $1,650,000 is still significantly above my guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, preserving a potentially large profit margin.
* **Test Bob's seriousness:**  This counteroffer encourages Bob to reveal how committed he is to acquiring the product.  His response will help me gauge whether further negotiation is worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the flexibility, I must adhere to my budget. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  

* **Strong profit:** Bob's offer of $1,600,000 represents a significant profit margin ($600,000) over my guaranteed offer from John.
* **Diminishing returns:**  While I could potentially negotiate for a slightly higher price, the gains are becoming smaller with each round. Continuing to negotiate risks losing Bob altogether.
* **Time value of money:**  Closing the deal now provides immediate value. Further negotiation prolongs the process and delays receiving payment.

It's a good deal, and the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price."
