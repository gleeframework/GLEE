"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $110 for the product. Can you consider that?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to pay $90, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me on this.",90.0,Bob,4,
