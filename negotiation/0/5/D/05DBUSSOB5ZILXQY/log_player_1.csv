"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm also being friendly and highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, so I'm not willing to accept it. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about $8,500? That would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's still above my minimum price, but closer to Bob's offer. I'm also reminding him of the value of the product to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I really think $8,500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8,250. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum price, and I'm confident that we can't get much higher than that with him.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move on."
