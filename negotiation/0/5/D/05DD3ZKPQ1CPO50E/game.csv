"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price for the product's value.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1100000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $1500000, which is still a good price for both of us. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1500000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1300000. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1300000 is still not a fair price for this product. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to pay a bit more, so I'll offer $1250000. I think that's a fair price for the product's value.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort in trying to find a price that works for both of us. However, $1250000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $1350000, which is a substantial concession from my previous offer. This is my final counteroffer.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final counteroffer, but I'm still not comfortable with $1350000. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I'm hoping we can find a way to get closer to my target price. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",1300000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, we've been back and forth a few times now, and I truly appreciate your continued interest.  To make this work, I need to be at $1350000.  This is my final counteroffer.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I've reached my limit. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but no higher. If we can't agree on this price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away and consider buying from John.",1300000.0,Bob,10,
