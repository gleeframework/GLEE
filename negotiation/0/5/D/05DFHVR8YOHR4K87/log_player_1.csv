"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with an offer significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high initial price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The tone implies a willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in multi-round bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, but still significantly above his $1,000,000 valuation.  There's room for negotiation. While selling to John is an option, I want to explore if I can get closer to $2,000,000 with Bob before accepting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Would you consider a price of $2,100,000?"" ,
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I'm reducing my initial price by $150,000 to demonstrate a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintain a Strong Position:**  The counteroffer is still significantly above Bob's offer, but also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** The message reinforces the idea that the product is worth more than what Bob is currently offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has potential, but I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend:** Bob is moving closer to my range, and the negotiations seem productive.
* **Time Consideration:** We still have several rounds left, and I'm aiming to secure a price above $2,000,000.
* **Backup Option:**  I can always fall back on selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding a Compromise:**  I've moved closer to Bob's offer, signaling that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price above $2,000,000. 
* **Positive Language:** Using phrases like ""finding a middle ground"" and ""acknowledging your willingness to negotiate""  encourages a collaborative atmosphere.
* **Limited Concessions:** The price reduction is smaller this round, indicating I'm getting closer to my desired outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $2,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Progress:**  Bob's counteroffer represents a smaller incremental increase than previous rounds, suggesting he may be reaching his limit.
* **Target Price:**  My target remains above $2,000,000. While $1,900,000 is tempting, I believe there's still room to negotiate, especially since I have John as a backup option.
* **Risk Assessment:** We are past the halfway point in the negotiation. I will likely make a final offer next and if Bob rejects it, I will sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're nearing the point where we need to make a decision. I value your time and interest, so I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear this is my last offer to signal I'm at my limit.
* **Slight Concession:** The price is a compromise, but still above $1,950,000, aiming to leave Bob with a sense of gain if he accepts.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By stating ""nearing the point where we need to make a decision,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency without being overly aggressive.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'll accept John's deal in the next round, ensuring I don't lose the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I'm hoping we can meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Bob has returned to his previous offer of $1,950,000, indicating he's unlikely to move closer to my $1,975,000. 
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is guaranteed and although lower than Bob's offer, it minimizes risk and avoids potentially wasting more time on a deal that might not happen. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only two rounds left, there's a high risk of ending the negotiation with no deal at all if I continue with Bob. 
 
It's time to secure a profitable outcome rather than risking a no-deal situation with Bob."
