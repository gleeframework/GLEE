"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers.",2250000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I'm interested in purchasing the product for a lower price. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down slightly, but $1,800,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Would you consider a price of $2,100,000?",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product has potential, but I still think $2,100,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,950,000 for the product.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $2,050,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",2050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $2,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,900,000 for the product.",1900000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're nearing the point where we need to make a decision. I value your time and interest, so I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1975000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1,950,000 for the product, which is the same price I offered in Round 4. I'm hoping we can meet at this price.",1950000.0,Bob,8,
