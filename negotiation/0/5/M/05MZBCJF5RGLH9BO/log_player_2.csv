"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and quality, we're offering it at a special introductory price of $120. We hope this aligns well with your expectations and budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $120 is still above his maximum budget of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows him to counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of your product, $120 is a bit outside my budget. I'm interested in purchasing, but I'm only able to offer $80 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. In order to accommodate your needs while still ensuring a fair exchange, I propose a revised price of $95 for the product. This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within your budget. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum of $80. Bob should continue to negotiate in hopes of getting a better price or, if negotiations fail, he can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  $95 is still a little high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $80.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. Considering the value of the product and your budget constraints, I am willing to offer the product at a price of $90. This is a fair compromise that I hope will meet both our needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still committed to getting the product for as close to $80 as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his target, it's still above his maximum. He's willing to continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal, knowing he can always purchase from John for $80 if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still only able to offer $85.  This is my final offer.  If it doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider purchasing from John."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to accept an offer of $87 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget and allows us to reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $87 is the closest to Bob's target of $80.  It's still a good deal for him, and he's been negotiating for several rounds already. He's likely to have a better chance of getting a better deal from John.  It's time to accept the offer and move on."
