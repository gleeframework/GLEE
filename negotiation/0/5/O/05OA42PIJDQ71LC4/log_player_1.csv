"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love! I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This allows for potential for a good profit while also giving Bob a sense that he's getting a deal.
* **Friendly Tone:**  Keeping a friendly tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Value Proposition:** I hint at the product's value to Bob, hoping to make him think about the worth it holds for him.

This approach aims to establish a starting point for negotiation, with the potential to get a better price than John's offer while still leaving room for compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counter Offer:** Bob's offer of $100 is closer to my minimum but still leaves room for improvement. I believe I can get closer to my desired price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counteroffer and see if I can push him closer to my asking price.
* **Selling to John is a Last Resort:** While selling to John for $80 is a safe option, I'm still aiming for a higher profit if possible.

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground that's beneficial to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $100 is closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $110?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer of $110 is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate but not settle for a price that's too low.
* **Positive Framing:** I use positive language like ""fair price"" and ""confident you'll be happy"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal. 
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away too much. This shows Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  While Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting Bob's offer means there's a risk he'll walk away. However, I'm confident I can secure a slightly better price with a counteroffer. 
* **Time is Running Out:** With only 6 rounds left, I need to make strategic decisions.  I'm willing to take the risk of another counteroffer, as selling to John for $80 would be my last resort. 

I'm going to counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to my minimum while also considering the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $105. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** My counteroffer of $105 is a compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90. This shows my willingness to negotiate but also highlights that I value the product. 
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language like ""fair price"" and ""very happy"" to encourage Bob to see the value in the deal.
* **Time Factor:** With limited rounds remaining, I need to find a middle ground quickly. This counteroffer shows my flexibility while still securing a price closer to my minimum.

This approach aims to  find a compromise that's beneficial to both of us while still staying close to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $95 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  With only 4 rounds remaining, the risk of continuing the negotiation is too high. If I reject this offer, I might not get a better one, and selling to John for $80 becomes a real possibility. 
* **Compromise:**  This offer represents a fair compromise, allowing me to secure a decent profit.

While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting Bob's offer ensures I don't miss out on a sale and potentially end up with a much lower price."
