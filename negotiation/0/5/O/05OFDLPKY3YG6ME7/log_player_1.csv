Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

This is a good starting point because it's more than your minimum price of $8,000 but also leaves room for negotiation. It shows you're willing to negotiate while still getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

It's better to keep negotiating with Bob since his offer is still above your minimum of $8,000. There's potential to get closer to your desired price of $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 
This counteroffer shows you're willing to compromise but still want a fair price. It's only $500 less than Bob's offer, so it might be more appealing to him than a larger jump in price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is very close to your desired price of $9,500. It's better to accept and secure the deal than risk further negotiation and potentially losing out to John's offer."
