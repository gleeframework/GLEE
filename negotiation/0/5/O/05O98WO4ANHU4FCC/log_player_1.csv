{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $15,000, but I'm willing to negotiate. By offering a lower price initially, I'm showing Bob that I'm open to discussion and hoping to incentivize him to accept.  I'll also be prepared to counter if he rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. That's the highest I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'm not going to settle for a price that's so far below my desired range. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing the negotiation."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet at $12,750? I'm willing to go up a bit from my previous offer, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,750 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with that price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Bob to budge closer to my desired range. If he rejects this counteroffer, I'll  sell to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable going below $13,000.  I'm willing to make a final concession and offer you the product for $12,900.  This is the very best I can do.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 12900} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the direction we're heading, but $12,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,900, which would be $12,450. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,450. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,450
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached my limit with Bob. His offer of $12,450 is still too low, and I'm not willing to negotiate further.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price.  This is the best option for me to maximize my profits."
