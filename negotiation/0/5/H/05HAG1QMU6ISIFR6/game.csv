"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know it would be equally valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This is a competitive price considering its value, and I'm confident it's a win-win situation.  Let me know your thoughts.  ",850000.0,Alice,1,
