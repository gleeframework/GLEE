"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $14,000
* **Your Maximum:** $12,000
* **John's Offer:** $12,000

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $2,000 less from John. Rejecting her offer opens the door for you to buy from John at your desired price."
