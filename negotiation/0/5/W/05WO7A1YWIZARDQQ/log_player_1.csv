"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 1300000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally advantageous to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling point. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and price sensitivity. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level.
* **Open to Discussion:**  The phrase ""open to discussing this further"" signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, making it more likely Bob will engage in counter-offers rather than walking away. 
* **Safety Net:**  Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 at any time. This knowledge allows you to be more assertive in the early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While his offer does show some willingness to move from his initial valuation, it's too early to accept such a low price. You still have room to negotiate and plenty of rounds left. 

You'll reject this offer and prepare a counteroffer that keeps the negotiation moving while aiming for a higher price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. While I understand your position, $850,000 is significantly below what I believe to be a fair price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings while still providing you with a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1150000
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:**  You're lowering your price by $150,000, demonstrating movement and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Bridging the Gap:**  This counteroffer aims to close the gap between your initial price and Bob's offer. By meeting in the middle, you signal flexibility while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value helps to justify the higher price point and prevent Bob from anchoring too heavily to his initial offer. 
* **Positive Framing:**  Phrasing like ""good deal"" and ""moving this forward"" promotes a collaborative and optimistic tone in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still allowing you a comfortable profit. Let's find common ground here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now at $950,000, which is still below your minimum of $1,000,000.  While he is slowly increasing his offer, the increments are relatively small and it's unlikely he'll reach your target price before the rounds run out. You have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,000,000. 

At this stage, it's strategically advantageous to cut your losses with Bob and secure the guaranteed profit by selling to John."
