"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a reasonable profit for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my initial offer and providing your perspective on the product's value. While I understand your position, $850,000 is significantly below what I believe to be a fair price. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product brings while still providing you with a good deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still out of my price range. To make this work, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential while still allowing you a comfortable profit. Let's find common ground here.",950000.0,Bob,4,
