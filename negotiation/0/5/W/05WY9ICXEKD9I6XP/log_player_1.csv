"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's value to me ($120). This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially earn a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's my minimum acceptable price, I want to see if I can get a little more.  There are still rounds left to negotiate, and I can always sell to John if I need to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm counteroffering with $125. It's still a bit higher than my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to compromise and gives Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is not budging on his offer of $120.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation, and I don't want to risk going any further and losing the sale entirely.  It's time to accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $120."
