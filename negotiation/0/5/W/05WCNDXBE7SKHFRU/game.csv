"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my value for the product. While I'm interested, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to consider the value of the product to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum of $900,000. I'm offering it to you for $920,000. Let me know if that works for you.",920000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $900,000?  I think this price is fair for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm offering it to you for $910,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",910000.0,Alice,5,,
