``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the product's uniqueness and value to justify the price. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I acknowledge the possibility of negotiation, signaling I'm willing to find a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I believe I can still do better.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range.  I have 8 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints.  While I'm eager to work with you, $950,000 is still a bit below my desired price point.

```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's a significant gain and within the acceptable range.  Accepting the offer ensures a deal and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.  I also have several rounds left to negotiate with John if needed."
