"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,350,000 is still a decent profit, I'm aiming for a higher price. I will reject Bob's offer and try to push for a better deal in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000}

I'm counteroffering with $1,375,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly above Bob's current offer, keeping the negotiation moving forward."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still a bit lower than I'm aiming for. I'll reject his offer and continue the negotiation process."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,350,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still a good profit and potentially a price that Bob might be willing to accept."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We are running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal.  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $1,200,000, which is a reasonable outcome, considering the limited rounds left."
