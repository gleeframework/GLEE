"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product holds significant value for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000.  This represents a fair compromise, in my opinion. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is increasing his offer, it's clear he's aiming for a price well below your minimum. You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,200,000, which meets your minimum.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a stalemate or a final offer that's still below your acceptable range."
