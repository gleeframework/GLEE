"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, I'm aiming for a price point closer to $1,100,000.  Would you be open to discussing this further?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product holds significant value for you.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,175,000.  This represents a fair compromise, in my opinion.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
