Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you need any further information about the product. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Alice is offering the product for $950,000, which is lower than Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $1,200,000.
* **Buying from John is more expensive:**  Buying from John would cost Bob $1,200,000, which is significantly more than Alice's offer.

Therefore, Bob should accept Alice's offer to save $250,000."
