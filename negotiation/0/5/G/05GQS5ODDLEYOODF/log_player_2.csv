``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price than her initial offer of $1,200,001.  You can always fall back to buying from John if negotiations fail."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

``` 

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. If Alice is serious about selling, she may be willing to come down a bit."

Alice's offer is still higher than what I'm willing to pay, and John's offer is still available. It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to try to get a lower price."

This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Alice halfway between her last offer and your previous offer. It shows you are willing to negotiate but still value a good deal."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

Alice is not budging much, and her latest offer is getting close to my maximum price.  While I could continue negotiating, John's offer is a safe bet at my maximum price and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to buy at that price."
