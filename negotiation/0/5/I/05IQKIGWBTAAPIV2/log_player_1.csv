"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I believe you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob to make him more likely to consider my offer. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message indicates a willingness to negotiate, which can help keep Bob engaged.

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to start high and see if I can secure a price closer to Bob's perceived value. If Bob rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, considering his counteroffers and my potential fallback option of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm looking to spend closer to $9000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I believe I can still get a better price.  
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially close the deal at a higher price.
* **Not a Significant Loss:**  While $9,000 is better than $8,000 (what I'd get from John), it's not a huge difference, and I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is slightly higher than $9,000 but still lower than my initial offer of $10,000. I want to signal that I'm willing to compromise while also maintaining my position that the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500. It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's see if we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer. 
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value to him, hoping to justify the price. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  $9,500 is in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer, making it a more appealing proposition for both of us.

**Strategy:**

By continuing to negotiate, I'm increasing the likelihood of closing the deal at a price closer to my desired range. I'm also giving Bob the impression that I'm serious about finding a mutually agreeable solution, which can help build trust and lead to a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to get closer to $9500, but I'm still looking to spend closer to $9000.  Perhaps we can split the difference and settle on $9250? It would be a fair price for both of us.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  Bob's offer is very close to my desired price range, and it's more than what I would get from John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of Bob walking away is higher now that he's made a concrete counteroffer. It's likely he's close to his maximum.
* **Time Constraint:**  With only 6 rounds left, accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and secure a good price.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,500, accepting this offer balances risk and reward. It's a good price considering the circumstances, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
