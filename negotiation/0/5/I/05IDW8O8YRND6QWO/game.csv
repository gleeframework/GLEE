"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's work together to make this happen!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Could you do $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still a bit far from my desired price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This price allows you to still get a good deal while ensuring I can make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal!",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,050,000 is closer, but still a little rich for me.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  Let's meet in the middle again at $1,012,500. This would be a great deal for both of us, allowing you to get a significant value from the product and giving me a price that is closer to my target. What do you say?",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting closer! To be honest, I have a strict budget for this purchase, and $1,000,000 is the absolute maximum I can spend. If you can meet that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
