"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which is valued at $15,000 to you. I am offering it to you today for $14,000. This is an exclusive opportunity to acquire a high-quality item at a competitive price. Please let me know if this proposal meets your expectations or if you would like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering. There's room for negotiation as Alice values the product at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $14,000. However, I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I need to maintain a certain level of profitability on my end. I am able to accommodate your budget at $13,000 for the product. I hope this revised offer better aligns with your expectations. Please let me know if this is acceptable or if you would like to propose another figure. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $14,000 offer to $13,000. This is a good deal for Bob as it saves him $2,000 compared to buying from John. While Bob might be able to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially increasing the price is present. It's safer and more financially advantageous to accept Alice's current offer."
