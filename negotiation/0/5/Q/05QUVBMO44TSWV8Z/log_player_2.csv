"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's something I know you'll find highly valuable.  My starting price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You can likely get a better price. There's no reason to accept at this point, as you have 9 more rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the value to me, I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit lower than where I need to be.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair price considering the immense value this product holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer, it's still above your desired price range. There's room for further negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal. You have 7 more rounds to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle - I'm offering $925,000.  This is a fair price that respects both our positions. "", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not quite there yet.  $925,000 is a good offer, but I need to get a bit closer to my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $937,500.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve our goals. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $937,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $937,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $937,500 is very close to your desired price range and is a fair compromise.  There's a good chance that you won't be able to get a lower price, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal.  While buying from John would provide you with the product, it would be a significantly higher price, and you have already made progress in your negotiations with Alice. It's more beneficial to accept this offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
