"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $180 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $130 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet in the middle.  While $160 is closer, I'm still only able to go up to $140.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to come down to $155, which is my lowest price for this product. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",155.0,Alice,5,
