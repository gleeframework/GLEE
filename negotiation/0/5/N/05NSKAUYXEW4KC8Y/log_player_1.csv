Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $100, so $115 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's some wiggle room for negotiation.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not giving it away cheaply, which might make Bob think the product is worth more.

Remember, you can always counteroffer if Bob rejects this initial offer. Good luck!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $105 is more than John's offer, it's still below your desired value of $115.  You can try to squeeze out a bit more from Bob.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation open, allowing you to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
