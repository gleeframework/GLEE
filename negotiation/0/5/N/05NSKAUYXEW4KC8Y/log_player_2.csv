"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's in great condition and worth a lot to the right person.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. 
* Alice's offer of $115 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $120. 
* It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $105?  I'm really interested in this product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of this product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $110 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's within his budget of $120.
*  Negotiating further might save a few dollars, but the risk is that Alice might reject the offer and Bob would have to buy from John at a higher price. 
*  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking a higher cost."
