"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I know is of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  This is a great price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should reject the offer and try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, but $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. Let's find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is closer to Bob's desired price of $8,500.  While a little more negotiation might be possible, accepting the offer at $9,000 ensures Bob gets the product at a lower price than John's offer and avoids further rounds of negotiation."
