"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate further. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that considers your budget while still allowing me to make a profit. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the flexibility, I am still looking to keep the price at or below $1,200,000. Can we find a middle ground that meets both our needs?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
