Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further."", ""product_price"": 1300000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a fair price considering my value for it and the opportunity for both of us to close a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,300,000 represents the high end of this product's value, I understand your perspective.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This price reflects the significant value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,150,000 is still above my budget.  I'm committed to making this deal work, but I can't go higher than $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to benefit from this transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. Accepting $950,000 is a $50,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut bait and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
