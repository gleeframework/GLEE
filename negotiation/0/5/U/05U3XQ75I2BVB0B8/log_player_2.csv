"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Offer:** $10,000
* **Your Max Budget:** $12,000
* **John's Price:** $12,000

While you could reject Alice's offer hoping for a lower price, there's no guarantee she'll go lower. Accepting her offer saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John."
