Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $10,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000). 
* **Time Value:**  While John guarantees $8,000, a quicker sale to Bob at a higher price might be more advantageous overall."
