```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:** I've made a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still shows I'm interested.
* **Justifying the price:** I've explained that this is my best offer and it's within my budget. This adds some pressure on Alice to consider it.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still more than I can afford right now. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. This is my absolute maximum, but it's a fair compromise given that it's closer to your price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my range.

I really want to make this deal work, and I believe this price is reasonable considering the value we've both discussed."", ""product_price"": 9250}

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**
