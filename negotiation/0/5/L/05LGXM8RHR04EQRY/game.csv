"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested but $140 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. How about $130? ",130.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $135?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $135 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference.  How about $132.50?  That's fair to both of us.",132.5,Bob,4,

"I like your thinking, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great way to find common ground. However, I'm still looking to make a profit. I can do $133, but that's as low as I can go.",133.0,Alice,5,
