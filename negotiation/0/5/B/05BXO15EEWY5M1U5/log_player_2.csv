"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You value the product at $150, and Alice is selling it for $140.  
* **Even though you could potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice, you're likely to save more time and effort by accepting her offer.** 

By accepting the offer, you save $10 compared to buying from John."
