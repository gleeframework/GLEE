"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $18,000 for the product.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay up to $5,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could potentially stretch my budget to $6,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my price range.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?  I think that's a fair price.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My counteroffer is $8,750 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",8750.0,Alice,7,
