Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so my counteroffer is $11,000 for the product. Let me know if that's more in line with what you're thinking.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $9,500 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your counteroffer.  $9,500 is getting closer, but it's still a bit outside my price range.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?  I think that's a fair price."",

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. My counteroffer is $8,750 for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to your price range, it's unlikely she'll go below $8,000 at this point. You can get the product for $8,000 from John, saving you time and potential further negotiation."
