{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a great price, considering its value to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm starting with a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000), but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures Bob's interest in the deal.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product and creating a sense of urgency. 

**Strategy:**

This initial offer is designed to:

* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** It's high enough to be appealing but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is serious about buying.
* **Start the Negotiation:** It establishes a starting point and sets the tone for a potentially profitable negotiation.
* **Provide a Safety Net:** I can always walk away and sell to John if Bob rejects my offer, ensuring I don't settle for less than my minimum price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired earnings. I'm not willing to settle for a price that significantly reduces my profit. I will counteroffer to try and close the gap between our expectations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** My counteroffer is $1,350,000, a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. 
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's position while reiterating my own needs. I frame the counteroffer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage a positive response. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain My Position:** I'm not giving in to Bob's initial counteroffer but am willing to negotiate.
* **Show Flexibility:**  By meeting in the middle, I demonstrate a willingness to compromise. 
* **Increase Chances of Agreement:** The counteroffer is reasonable and leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort. However, I am still unable to meet you at $1,350,000 due to my budget constraints. I would like to suggest a price of $1,300,000. I hope this proposal will be acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has remained firm on his price of $1,300,000. While this is close to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough to make it worthwhile to continue negotiating.  I've already made a compromise by offering $1,350,000, and it's clear that Bob is unwilling to budge.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to sell to John for $1,500,000, ensuring I receive my desired profit."
