Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for some wiggle room.  Let me know if you're interested.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence.  However, $100 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $112.50. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5

Alice's offer is still above your budget.  While you could continue negotiating,  you've reached a point where the time and effort are not worth the potential savings. Buying from John gives you the product at your desired price, and you can avoid further negotiation."
