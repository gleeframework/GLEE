"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $1,200,000 is still too low for me.  I want to see if I can get him to budge higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1,400,000?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe this product will be worth much more to you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get more from him. I'm not ready to sell to John for $1,000,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my asking price.

Bob is now offering my minimum price, but I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation. I'm not sure I can convince him to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing the deal.  It's time to take the safe option and sell to John for $1,000,000."
