"Bob, I'm offering you a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to own [Product description]. This product is worth a fortune to the right person. I'm starting with a price of $1500000.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $1200000 for it.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1200000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $1400000?  This is a fair compromise, and I believe this product will be worth much more to you in the long run.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1100000 for the product.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1100000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm prepared to be flexible, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle at $1300000.  This offer is firm, and I'm confident you won't regret it.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
