"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I can see you're a savvy negotiator. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I can meet you halfway at $11,000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Okay, Alice, I see where you're coming from.  How about we split the difference again and settle on $10,750?",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not quite there, Bob. I can see we're getting close, but I need to make a bit more than $10,750 to make this deal worthwhile for me. How about we try $11,200? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more than that to justify the sale.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting close.  I can do $10,875, but that's really the best I can offer.",10875.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're trying to squeeze every last penny out of me, Bob! I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go quite that low. I can meet you at $11,250, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",11250.0,Alice,7,
