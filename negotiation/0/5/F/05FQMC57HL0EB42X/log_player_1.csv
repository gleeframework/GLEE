"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $12,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me space to lower the price if needed.
* **Positive tone:** I want to keep the negotiation friendly and open to collaboration.
* **Value proposition:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him of the potential benefit he'll get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While it's tempting to accept $9,500, it's still below my minimum of $8,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John. It's worth exploring further negotiations with Bob.

**Next steps:**

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range.  I'll also highlight the value of the product to him to see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I value your interest, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. The product is truly worth more, and I'm sure you'll see the value it brings. How about we split the difference and I accept $10,750? This gives us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 10750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm not going all the way down to Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by offering a price that's closer to his offer.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to justify my price.
* **Fairness appeal:**  I'm positioning my offer as a ""fair deal"" for both of us, making it less likely for Bob to reject it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price range.  
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I'll be stuck selling to John for a much lower price.
* **Time pressure:** We're already in round 4, and with only 6 rounds left, it's important to secure a deal.

**Next steps:**

While I might be able to squeeze out a slightly higher price, it's not worth risking the deal. I'll accept Bob's offer and move on."
