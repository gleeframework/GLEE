"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. To show my seriousness in acquiring this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  This is a fair price, considering your initial offer and my previous counteroffer. Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
