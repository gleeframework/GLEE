Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Appealing to value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob to make the price seem more reasonable.
* **Flexibility:** This offer allows for counteroffers and negotiation, giving me the opportunity to reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,200,000 gives me leverage to walk away if Bob's counteroffers are too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is still a significant amount, but I'm trying to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Better options exist:** Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, but still higher than his perceived value, suggesting there's room for negotiation. 
* **Exploring counteroffers:** I'm willing to explore counteroffers with Bob, aiming for a higher price.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  Having John's offer as a backup allows me to confidently reject Bob's offer and proceed with counteroffers without being pressured."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer but still leaving room for further negotiation.
* **Emphasis on value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob to justify the price. 
* **Open to discussion:** My message encourages continued dialogue and signals that I'm open to reaching an agreement. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the price above Bob's initial offer, maximizing potential profit while maintaining the possibility of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to desired price:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is only $75,000 below my initial counteroffer of $950,000. 
* **Maximizing profit:**  While not ideal, accepting this offer will still generate a significant profit, considering Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Minimizing risk:** Further negotiation may lead to a lower offer, or Bob could decide to walk away altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a considerable profit. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Even though I'm accepting Bob's offer, I have the backup of John's offer at $1,200,000, which provides assurance and security. 

While I would prefer a higher price, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical decision considering the potential risks of further negotiations."
