"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $10,500 is lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $11,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my desired price.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's settle on $10,400. This gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for this product. What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,5,
