"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing to sell the product to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $9,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get it for even less.  He has 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's no need to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm looking to pay closer to $7,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price you proposed. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $8,500 is a good price, he still wants to try and negotiate it down further. He has several rounds left and doesn't want to settle too quickly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still looking to pay a bit less, though. I'd be happy to pay $8,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price you proposed. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $8,250. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a bit closer to your original offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's gotten the price down significantly from her initial offer and is now only $250 away from his target price.  He's also in the middle of the negotiation, so there's no guarantee he can get it lower.  The risk of continuing to negotiate is that Alice might get frustrated and walk away, or he might run out of rounds and have to buy from John at a higher price."
