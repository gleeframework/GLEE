"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly below my minimum acceptable value, allowing room for negotiation while still leaving me a decent profit. It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept the $12,500, I'm going to hold out for a better price. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product's value for me.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a decent amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,750 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob and want to see if I can get closer to $13,000. I'm not yet ready to settle for a price significantly lower than my minimum target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I believe you'll still get a fantastic deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,800. This is the absolute maximum I can do. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $12,800 is getting closer to my desired price, I've had 5 rounds of negotiations and I don't think I'm going to get any closer to my target of $13,000.  Given that I'm confident John will pay $15,000, I'm going to choose to sell the product to him.  It's a guaranteed deal that meets my minimum acceptable value and saves me the effort of further negotiations."
