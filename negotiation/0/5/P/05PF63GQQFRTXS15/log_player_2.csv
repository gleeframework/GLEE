"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial asking price, it's still above your maximum budget of $12,000. You have room to negotiate, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'd be willing to pay $12,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step towards your desired price point while still leaving room for negotiation. It shows Alice that you are serious about buying the product but also demonstrates that you are a savvy buyer who is willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? I'm confident this price still represents a great deal for you, and it allows me to keep the product's value for me.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $13,250 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your maximum of $12,000. You can continue to negotiate and see if you can get Alice closer to your price point. There's still room to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,250 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $12,750? It's a fair price for both of us, allowing me to stay within my budget and you to get a decent amount for the product."", ""product_price"": 12750}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer continues to chip away at the price difference, making a more appealing offer for Alice while still staying within your maximum budget. It demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while also showing you're a savvy negotiator."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,750 isn't quite where I need to be.  Let's try $13,000. It's a good compromise, and I believe you'll still get a fantastic deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price point, $13,000 is still outside your budget. It is still worth continuing to negotiate, as you can potentially get Alice to lower her price further. You're also only halfway through the negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility, but $13,000 is still a little too high for me.  I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,800. This is the absolute maximum I can do. If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 12800}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows your commitment to closing the deal but also sets a clear deadline for Alice. The price is only $200 higher than your maximum budget, demonstrating your willingness to compromise but also highlighting the price sensitivity of your position. This could be a good way to push Alice into accepting the offer or to get a final counteroffer closer to your desired price."
