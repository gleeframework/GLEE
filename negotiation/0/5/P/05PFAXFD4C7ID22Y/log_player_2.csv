"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, especially since we have ample rounds and the option to buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. However, I have to consider my costs and the value I'm looking to get from this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above her value of $8,000. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if we can get closer to a price that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?  I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $8,200 for the product. Can we discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to her value, but we can still push a bit further. We're willing to go up to $8,000, and with a bit of negotiation, we might be able to get it for a bit less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been very patient and I respect that.  To be honest, my absolute limit is $8,000.  If you can do that, we have a deal.  If not, I understand and wish you the best in selling the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob. However, I've already received an offer from another buyer, John, who is willing to buy the product for $8,000. I'm not sure if I can do better than that. I'm willing to meet you at $8,100, but I need to consider John's offer as well. Can you think of a reason why you're worth more to me than John? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tricky situation. Alice is bluffing about John's offer (we know he'll sell for $10,000), but she's also very close to her absolute bottom line.  There's a risk she'll walk away if we push further. Accepting at $8,100 secures us a decent deal and avoids the risk of losing the product entirely."
