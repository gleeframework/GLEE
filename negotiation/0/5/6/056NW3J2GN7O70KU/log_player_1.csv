Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

Here's why this offer makes sense:

* **Maximizes Potential Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150 and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance Bob will pay a premium above his perceived value. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A $40 markup over Bob's perceived value is significant, but not so high that it's likely to scare him off immediately. 
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:** If Bob tries to negotiate, you have some wiggle room to go down slightly while still staying above your minimum price."
