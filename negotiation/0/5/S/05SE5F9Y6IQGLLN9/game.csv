"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. How about we split the difference and go with $925,000?  This gives you a great deal, and it's a price that works for me. Let's make this happen!",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a price that works for me.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. It's a fair price, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal worthwhile. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm offering $887,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",887500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  However, $887,500 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to go down to $895,000. This would be a significant investment for you, and I'm confident you'll see a great return. Let's make this happen.",895000.0,Alice,7,
