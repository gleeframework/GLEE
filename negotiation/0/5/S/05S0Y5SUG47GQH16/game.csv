"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price, considering it's still above your value and offers a good deal for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,200. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9,200 is closer, I'm still looking to get the best possible deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? This offers a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you at $9,400 if you're willing to make a concession.",9400.0,Alice,5,
