It's always a good idea to try and negotiate a better price.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for improvement."

Round 2

I'm starting with a lower counteroffer to see how flexible Alice is. We'll adjust as needed in the next rounds."

Alice is coming up a little, but it's still more than I'm willing to pay at this point. I'll try to get closer to my target with another counteroffer."

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but I'm still aiming for a price below $1,200,000. We're getting closer, and hopefully, Alice will be willing to meet me halfway."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

We're getting close to Alice's original offer. I'm going to stick to my initial target and see if she's willing to accept it. If not, I might have to consider buying from John."

Alice has come down significantly, and we're very close to my target price.  I'm going to accept this offer, as continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether and having to buy from John at a higher price."
