,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get a bit closer to my initial offer. How about we discuss a price of $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my initial offer. How about we discuss a price of $1700000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not convinced that $1700000 is the right price. How about $1550000?,1550000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're still hesitant, but I'm getting a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my initial target. I'm willing to make one more significant concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we discuss a price of $1600000, and I'll throw in some additional perks to sweeten the deal?",1600000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting stuck in a loop. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. However, I need to get closer to my target, so I'm willing to go up to $1650000. This is my final concession, and I hope we can come to an agreement",1650000.0,Alice,9,
