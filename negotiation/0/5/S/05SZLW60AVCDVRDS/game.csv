"Thanks Alice, that's a great starting point! However, my budget for this product is closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. It's a great compromise that still gives you a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product's value. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit high for me, though. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're able to accept that.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already come down a significant amount from my initial offer, and I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $10,250, which is still a great deal for you. What do you think?",10250.0,Alice,5,
