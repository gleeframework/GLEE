Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but still offers a substantial saving compared to my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Urgency and Scarcity:** By mentioning other interested buyers and a ""limited-time offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy involves a degree of risk. If Bob rejects the offer, I'll still make a profitable sale to John but miss the chance for an even higher profit. 
* Bob's risk tolerance and negotiation skills are unknown factors that could influence his decision."
