"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value I've put into this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $16,000 to make it worth my while.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I've already compromised a bit by offering $16,000, and I'm not willing to go as low as $14,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16,000 and $14,000, so I'll offer it to you for $15,500.",15500.0,Alice,5,
