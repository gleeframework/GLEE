"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is way above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's best to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $15,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. Let's aim for a price that's closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $13,000 is closer to your budget than $15,000, it's still above your comfort zone. You're willing to spend $8,000 max, and there's no reason to go higher right now, especially since you have the option of buying from John for that price. Rejecting the offer gives you more room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about purchasing this product, but I'm really limited to my $8,000 budget. Could we maybe try $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum of $12,000. I'm thinking of $12,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still too far above your budget. At this point, you've made it clear that you're willing to spend $8,000, and Alice is unwilling to budge significantly. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John, who is offering the product at your maximum price.  There's a good chance Alice won't come down to your desired price, and you'll have wasted several rounds of negotiation."
