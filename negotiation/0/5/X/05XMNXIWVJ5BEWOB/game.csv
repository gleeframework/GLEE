"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $15,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm interested in the product, but my budget is capped at $8,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at that price, as it's below my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. Let's aim for a price that's closer to my minimum of $12,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very serious about purchasing this product, but I'm really limited to my $8,000 budget. Could we maybe try $9,000? That would be a fair compromise, I believe.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're still interested in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to stay above my minimum of $12,000. I'm thinking of $12,500. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
