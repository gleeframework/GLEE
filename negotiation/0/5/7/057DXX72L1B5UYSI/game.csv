"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opportunity, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,200,000 is below my initial expectations, I understand the need to find a compromise.  Would you consider $2,000,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still acknowledging the true value of this product.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $2,000,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
