"Hey Alice, I really appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $125 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $160 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  Let's split the difference and make a deal.",140.0,Bob,4,
