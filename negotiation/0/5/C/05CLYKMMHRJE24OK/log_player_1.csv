"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being positive and encouraging, hoping to establish a good rapport. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  This offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation while still leaving me room to reach a price I'm comfortable with.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  I'm aware that I have a backup option in John, but I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $5,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price from Bob, given his interest in the product.
* **Value of Time:** I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer, so I can afford to keep negotiating.

I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $5,000 is too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This price still gives you a good value, and it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I've lowered my price from $12,000 to $10,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting Value:** I emphasize the value Bob would get at this price, reinforcing his interest.
* **Compromise Language:** I use phrases like ""fair compromise"" and ""good value"" to encourage Bob to see this as a win-win scenario.
* **Keeping Options Open:** This offer still leaves me with room to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down. I'm still a little ways off at that price. Would you be open to $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:** I still have time and the backup option with John, so I can afford to keep negotiating.
* **Seeking a Better Outcome:**  I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer, especially considering he's shown interest in the product.

I'll counter with a price closer to $9,000 in the next round, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're still looking for a lower price, but $7,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $9,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a price that still gives you a great value for this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price again, but staying above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasize Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value to encourage him to see $9,000 as a fair deal.
* **Positive and Solution-Oriented:**  My tone remains positive and focused on finding a solution that works for both of us.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer puts me in a strong position for the next round. If Bob rejects, I can either counter with a slightly lower offer or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is exactly the midpoint between my last offer of $9,000 and his last offer of $7,000.  This is a good sign that we're both willing to compromise.
* **Close to My Minimum:**  While $8,000 is still below my ideal price of $15,000, it's within a reasonable range of my minimum acceptable price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will either drop out of the negotiation or come back with an even lower offer.
* **Time Constraint:** I have only 4 rounds left, and selling to John would be my only other option.

Accepting Bob's offer will secure a sale and get me closer to my goal of earning as much as possible."
