"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $850,000. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to come to a reasonable agreement.",825000.0,Bob,4,
