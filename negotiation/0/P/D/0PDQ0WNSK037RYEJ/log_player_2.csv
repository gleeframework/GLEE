"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob can potentially get the product for less than $1,200,000. There's a good chance Alice will accept a counteroffer, as she values the product at $800,000.  Rejecting allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her value of $800,000.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation and leaves room for further compromise if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,100,000, which is still a good deal for Bob compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While there's always the possibility of negotiating further, accepting this offer minimizes risk and gets Bob the product at a favorable price."
