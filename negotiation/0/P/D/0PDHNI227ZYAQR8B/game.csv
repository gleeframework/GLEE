"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,400,000? This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the value you place on the product.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,400,000 is close, but I can't let it go for less than $1,550,000.  This is a very fair offer considering its value.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,450,000. This is a very competitive offer and I'm hoping we can close the deal.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
