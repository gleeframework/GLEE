(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push Alice a little further, we're getting very close to her bottom line (likely around $1,000,000). The difference between her current offer ($1,025,000) and a potential slightly better deal isn't worth the risk of her walking away or the time investment of further rounds. Accepting at $1,025,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
