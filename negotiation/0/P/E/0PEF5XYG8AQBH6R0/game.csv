I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a unique item that's worth $15000 to you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.,14000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I think $14000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and it's still a good deal for me.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $11500. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",11500.0,Bob,4,
