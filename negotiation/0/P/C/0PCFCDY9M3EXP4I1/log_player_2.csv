"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be even more valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe it will be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  While you're willing to spend up to $15,000, Alice is offering it for $12,000. This saves you $3,000.
* **It's a good deal for Alice too.** She values the product at $10,000, so she's making a $2,000 profit. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy to maximize your savings while still getting the product you want."
