Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $1,800,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000, but I'm hoping to capitalize on Bob's potential interest.  I'll need to gauge his reaction and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable value and I'm confident I can get a better deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,500,000. This is still a substantial profit for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to seriously consider selling to John, as we're getting closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly my minimum acceptable value.  While I'd prefer to get more, I'm happy to accept this offer.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident that it's the best possible outcome given the circumstances."
