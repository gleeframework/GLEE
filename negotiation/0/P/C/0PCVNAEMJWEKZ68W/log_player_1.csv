"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you first.  Taking into account its value and potential, I propose a starting price of $2,000,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Negotiation theory suggests starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially secures a better deal. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's seriousness and gives you information for the next round. 

**Important:** Even though I have John as a backup, my goal is to maximize profit. Settling for John's offer too early would be leaving money on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  Given my research and the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This represents a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to make a substantial profit. Let's see if we can work together on this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000.  I have room to negotiate and will aim to close the gap in the next round. John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm confident I can secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but the price you proposed doesn't reflect the true value and potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle – I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer represents a significant compromise on my end and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** I've significantly reduced my initial asking price to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Anchor High:** While moving closer to Bob's range, I'm still anchoring the negotiation significantly above both his offer and my minimum. This leaves room for further concessions while aiming for a higher final price.
* **Justification:**  The message reiterates the product's value while highlighting my compromise. This aims to nudge Bob towards a more agreeable offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 remains too steep for me.  I'm sticking to my initial offer of $1,300,000. This price is fair considering the product's value to me and allows for a solid profit margin for you.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price. Let's close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is standing firm at $1,300,000, indicating this might be his upper limit. However, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's $200,000 below my minimum. I'll use the next round to gauge his seriousness and explore if there's any flexibility on his end. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a backup, but I want to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position, but I need you to understand that $1,300,000 simply isn't feasible for me. I've analyzed this deal thoroughly, and to make it work, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,600,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, and it reflects my strong interest in seeing this product benefit your business. Take some time to consider it – I believe it's a fair and final offer."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counteroffer clearly signals that I'm reaching my limit. Using phrases like ""final offer"" and ""thoroughly analyzed""  adds weight to the negotiation. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating that this price is a significant compromise on my end while emphasizing the potential benefits to Bob.
* **Strategic Pause:**  Giving Bob time to consider and potentially re-evaluate his position might lead to a positive response in the next round. 

**Important:**  While I'm sticking to the negotiation, I'm closely observing Bob's reactions. If he remains inflexible in the next round, I'll likely accept John's offer to ensure I don't miss out on a guaranteed sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need to make a profit, and I'm willing to compromise further. I'm raising my offer to $1,400,000. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob has finally moved significantly from his initial offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Acceptable Profit:** While $1,400,000 is still below my ideal price, it's only $100,000 less than my guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to push for a higher price with Bob could backfire. He might walk away, and I'd lose both potential buyers.

This acceptance represents a good balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal within a reasonable timeframe."
