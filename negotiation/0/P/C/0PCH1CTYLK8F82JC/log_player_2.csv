"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still a bit above what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a good compromise. While I was hoping for a lower price,  it's significantly lower than John's price of $800,000. Accepting this offer saves me $75,000 and still allows me to acquire the product within my budget."
