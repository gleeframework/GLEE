"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is above his maximum budget.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $20,000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12,000 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $18000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to his budget, it's still above his ideal price. He's willing to keep negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12,000.  It's my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is now within his budget, it's still a little higher than he wants to pay. He's willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if he can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000?  I'm confident that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14000 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which would be $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $15,000 is the same as John's price. Since Bob has a limited number of rounds, it's a good idea to avoid further negotiation and secure the product at this price. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and Bob might end up losing out on the deal."
