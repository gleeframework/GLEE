"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $20000 is above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $12000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18000 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $12000.  It's my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $18000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16000. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know what you think!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $16000 is closer to what I can afford, but I'm still hoping for a slightly better price.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14000?  I'm confident that's a fair compromise for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14000 is a good compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $16000 and $14000, which would be $15000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to accept it. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,7,
