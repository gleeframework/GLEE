Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still giving me a good starting point. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $100, so I have some wiggle room."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm lowering my price to $95, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not desperate to sell for his original price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is still lower than my ideal, it's closer to my minimum and I risk losing out on the deal altogether if I keep rejecting. Selling to John for $100 is a safe bet, but I believe there's a good chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher in future rounds. I'll accept his offer for now and see where the negotiation leads."
