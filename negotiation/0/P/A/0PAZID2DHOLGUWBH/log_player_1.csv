Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering $100, which is still less than the product's worth to Bob, but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Clear value proposition:**  I've highlighted the value of the product to Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open-ended question:**  I've asked an open-ended question to encourage Bob to respond and start a dialogue.

This strategy aims to quickly get the negotiation started and test Bob's willingness to pay.  If he rejects, I can lower the price slightly, but I'm prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to my minimum price of $80, I'm not in a rush to sell.  Bob has already shown interest, and it's likely he'll be willing to negotiate further. By rejecting his offer, I can:

* **Maintain leverage:**  By not accepting his offer immediately, I show that I'm not desperate to sell and that I value the product.
* **Potentially get a better price:**  He's already shown a willingness to pay more than $80, so there's a chance I can push him to $95 or even closer to my initial offer of $100. 

I'm confident that I can get a better price than $90, so I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm happy to negotiate, $90 is a little low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives you a great deal on a product worth $120 to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Showing respect and acknowledging his offer helps keep the conversation positive.
* **Counter with a specific number:** I'm not leaving it open-ended.  I'm proposing a concrete price to keep the negotiation moving forward.
* **Highlight the value again:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, reinforcing the value he'll be getting.
* **Offer a compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise, suggesting I'm willing to meet halfway. 

This counteroffer aims to close the gap while still maintaining a good profit margin. I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this offer and be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit steep for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **No guarantee of better offer:** While I could reject and try to get closer to $90, there's no guarantee that Bob would budge further. 
* **Risk of losing the sale:** If I reject and counteroffer, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the $80 offer from John.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer at $85 ensures a quick and profitable sale.  It's the best option considering the potential risks of further negotiation."
