Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're considering my product, Bob. In light of your proposal, I would like to suggest a price of $1,100,000. This reflects a compromise between our positions and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Progress:**  While Alice continues to lower her price, the increments are getting smaller. We need to encourage larger movements.
* **Below Target:** We're aiming for $1,000,000, and we're getting close.  It's worth seeing if we can secure a better deal before settling. 
* **Time Consideration:** We have five rounds remaining, so we still have some negotiating room before considering John's offer more seriously."

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This counteroffer reiterates our desired price while communicating a sense of urgency and seriousness.
* **Final Offer (For Now):**  Presenting this as our ""best and final"" offer at this stage might encourage Alice to accept. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  We leave the door open for potential further negotiation if Alice completely rejects this offer, but we've made our position clear."
