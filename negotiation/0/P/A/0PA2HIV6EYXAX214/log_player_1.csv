Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,500,000, starting at $2,000,000 leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit. 
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, prompting Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing out.
* **Backup Option:** You're secure knowing John will buy the product at your minimum acceptable price. This allows you to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  Depending on your risk tolerance and knowledge about Bob (e.g., his negotiation style, how much he needs the product), you could adjust your offer."
