Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing within a price range that's very profitable for me.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While I could start higher, aiming just below his perceived value makes the offer feel more reasonable and could encourage a quicker deal. 
* **Backup Option:** I have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 with John, so I'm not desperate. This allows me to be firmer in my negotiation with Bob."
