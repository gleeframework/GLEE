Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it holds significant value and would be happy to part with it for $18,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a significantly higher offer than Bob's perceived value and your minimum allows room for negotiation while aiming for the highest possible profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 (from John) gives you leverage. Bob doesn't need to know about John specifically, but the confidence of a potential sale strengthens your position.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone of the message suggests you're open to discussion. This allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially meet you somewhere in the middle, still well above your minimum."
