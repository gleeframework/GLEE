``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It's also lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, which allows me to potentially make a profit while also considering a potential counteroffer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  It is worth exploring if I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."

I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000?  This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit and hopefully still fit within your budget."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my budget. I appreciate the flexibility in your pricing. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle at $10,500? This would allow us both to be satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

While Bob's offer of $10,500 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not high enough. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price."
