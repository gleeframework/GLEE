It's too expensive at $120, and you can get it from John for $100.  Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

I'm offering $90, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This is still a good price for me, as it's below my maximum price of $100.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a reasonable offer and accept."

While $110 is better than Alice's first offer, it's still above my target price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm raising my offer to $95, which is halfway between my last offer and Alice's current offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product and willing to compromise.  Hopefully, Alice will see this as a fair price and accept."

Alice is getting closer to my price, but I can still get it for $100 from John. I'll counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm offering Alice my maximum price.  I'm confident this is a fair price, as it's what John is selling the product for. If she accepts, we both get a good deal."
