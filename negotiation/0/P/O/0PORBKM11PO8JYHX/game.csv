"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you're interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great price, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it's a great value.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit higher than $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,750?",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this price. Let's close this deal!",9250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell the product to me for $8,000, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,6,
