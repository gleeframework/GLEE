I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't sell for less than my floor price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price, and I'm sure you'll find it's a great value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm hoping to get closer to my target of $10,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating with you, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this price. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,250. I've already spoken to another seller who is willing to sell the product to me for $8,000, and I'm not sure I can justify paying more than that. Would you be willing to meet me at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and it sounds like he's not willing to negotiate much further. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with him, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my target price.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of getting stuck with a lower price."
