"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. That's a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $105. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $98. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value and the price I'm willing to pay. Let me know if you're willing to consider it.",98.0,Bob,4,
