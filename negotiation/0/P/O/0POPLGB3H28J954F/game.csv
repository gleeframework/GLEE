"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $110 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $115 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $120? That way, we both walk away happy.",120.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still trying to get the best deal possible. How about we meet at $112? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",112.0,Bob,6,
