"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product.  I think it could really benefit you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product could benefit me, $2,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you counteroffering, Bob. However, $1,000,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To be fair to both of us, I could consider letting it go for $1,700,000. This price reflects the true value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,700,000 is still too high for me.  I can offer $1,100,000.  This offer represents a fair compromise, I believe.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, we're still quite far apart. Let's find a middle ground â€“ how about $1,550,000? This feels like a fair offer that acknowledges the value this product brings.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I can go up to $1,200,000. This is my final offer, as I know I can get it for this price elsewhere.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
