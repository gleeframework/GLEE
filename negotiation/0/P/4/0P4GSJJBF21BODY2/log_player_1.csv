Even though the offers are getting closer, we're still above John's offer. It's time to push Bob a bit more and see if he's willing to go higher."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation, and Bob is getting closer to my minimum. However, I'll try one last time to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but this is my final offer.  Would you be willing to do $168? That's a significant discount from my original asking price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still aiming for a price closer to $150. Would $160 be within your range? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's getting too close to John's offer, and with only a few rounds left, it's unlikely Bob will significantly increase his offer. Taking $160 is better than risking getting stuck at or below $150."
