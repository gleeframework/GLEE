"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low.  It's less than what I would get selling to another buyer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that $1,100,000 is low, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Perhaps we can agree on $1,220,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number.",1220000.0,Bob,4,
