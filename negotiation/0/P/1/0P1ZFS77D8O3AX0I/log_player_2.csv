Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low.  It's less than what I would get selling to another buyer.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the value to you.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I understand that $1,100,000 is low, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Perhaps we can agree on $1,220,000?  That's a significant price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that number."", ""product_price"": 1220000}"
