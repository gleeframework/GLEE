Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefit it can bring to your specific needs."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While aiming high, the offer leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value *specifically* to Bob, increasing his perceived worth. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):**  While John provides a safety net at $800,000, the focus is to secure the best possible deal with Bob first."
