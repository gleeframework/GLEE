"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that my product is worth more than $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,225,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to purchase your product today.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your maximum offer of $1,200,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer it to you for $1,210,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's still a good deal for both of us.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
