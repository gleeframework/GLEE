"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think the product is worth less than $14,000. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counter-offer, Bob. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm confident in the value of this product. Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which would be $12,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",12500.0,Bob,4,
