Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below your minimum acceptable price ($150) creates a sense of urgency and value. It might entice Bob to buy, thinking he's getting a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** If Bob outright rejects this offer, there might be a small window to negotiate slightly downwards, still potentially getting a better price than John's offer."
