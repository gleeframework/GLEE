"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product.  Given its unique value and features, I'm asking for $22,000. I think you'll agree it's a fair price.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is a bit steep for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your budget considerations. However, $9,000 undervalues the product significantly. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  While I do value the product,  $18,000 is still outside my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair offer, reflecting both the product's worth and my budgetary constraints.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the continued negotiation. I understand you're on a tighter budget, but I need to be closer to my minimum for this product.  Would you be willing to go to $15,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer and reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. However,  $15,000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,000?  That feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value of the product while working within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,6,
