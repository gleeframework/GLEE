"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming to maximize profit and have room to negotiate. Starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and John's offer gives us that space.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to subtly manage Bob's expectations and anchor the negotiation around a higher number. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob outright rejects this initial offer, it gives us a benchmark to work down from strategically over the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below our minimum and John's standing offer. We have room to negotiate and time is on our side (for now)."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a significant drop from our initial price to show flexibility and signal willingness to negotiate. However, the new price is still comfortably above both Bob's offer and John's standing offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's potential benefits specifically for Bob's business, aiming to shift his focus from pure price to potential return on investment.
* **Maintaining Momentum:** We're aiming to keep the negotiation moving and gauge Bob's flexibility. A large counteroffer from our side might encourage him to make a more substantial counter-proposal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,550,000, which reflects a fair compromise. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to my business, and I'm eager to finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,550,000 is now above John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While we could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk Bob might decrease his offer or walk away. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation. 
* **Time Value:**  We're already four rounds in, and closing the deal sooner allows us to allocate our time and resources to other potential opportunities."
