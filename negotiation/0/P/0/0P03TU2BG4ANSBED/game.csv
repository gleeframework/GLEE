"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving some room for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 undervalues the product's true potential. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. Let's meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,550,000, which reflects a fair compromise. I'm confident that this product will be a valuable asset to my business, and I'm eager to finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
