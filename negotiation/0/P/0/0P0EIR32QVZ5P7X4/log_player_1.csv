Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is below my bottom line.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $875,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit below my budget. I'm willing to pay $795,000 for the product. This is my final offer within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $795,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $795,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob's offer of $795,000 is tempting, it's still below your absolute minimum of $800,000. It's unlikely Bob will go higher given his ""final offer"" statement.  You have a guaranteed offer from John at $800,000, so it's strategically the best choice to secure the deal now."
