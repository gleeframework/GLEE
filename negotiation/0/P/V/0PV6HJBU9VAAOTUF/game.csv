"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're providing, $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I expect to gain. Let's see if we can work this out.",12500.0,Bob,2,
