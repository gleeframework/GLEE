"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with an offer of $920,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920,000 is still a bit high.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget while giving you a reasonable profit. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiations, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000. This is a fair price that allows me to acquire the product within my budget, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well.  Let's finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,6,
