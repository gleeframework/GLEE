"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above my budget. I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so rejecting this offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in the first round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm interested in this product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with an offer of $920,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm still aiming to save as much as possible, so I'll reject this offer and continue negotiating.  My goal is to get closer to my $800,000 limit, and with several rounds left, there's room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $920,000 is still a bit high.  I'm prepared to pay $850,000 for the product. This would be a fair deal for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product within my budget while giving you a reasonable profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'll meet you at $900,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $900,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, and with several rounds left, there's still time to negotiate a price closer to that.  I'll reject the offer and make another counteroffer."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued negotiations, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm on my offer of $850,000.
