"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a valuable piece, and I'm sure you'll find it to be a great investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my potential earnings.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $1,200,000 is above Bob's perceived value, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,000,000, giving us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the product's value and emphasizes a potential return on investment for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I appreciate the offer, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  I still have 9 rounds left, and I believe I can push for a better price. 
* **Selling to John is an option:** While $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, I'm hoping to secure a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $700,000 is simply not enough. How about $950,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a significant decrease:** I'm showing flexibility by dropping the price from $1,200,000 to $950,000, but still keeping it above my minimum threshold. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is valuable and worth a price closer to my initial offer. 
* **Positive tone:**  I'm keeping the communication friendly and encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but I have a budget I need to stick to. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $825,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I'm halfway through the negotiation rounds, and with more time, I can likely get closer to my target price.
* **Balancing risk and reward:** While selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, I'm willing to take a calculated risk and try to get a higher price from Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, it's still a bit too low. To show you my commitment to making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the product's unique value while giving you a good deal. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show flexibility:** I'm making another significant decrease, signaling my desire to reach a deal.
* **Keep it above minimum:** $900,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, but it's getting closer to Bob's offer.
* **Positive and urgent tone:** I'm expressing my commitment to making the deal happen and urging Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I appreciate you coming down on the price. I could go up to $850,000, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob is getting closer, $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited rounds left:** We're approaching the halfway point of the negotiation. There's still time to push for a better price, but I need to be strategic. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000, but I believe I can get closer to that price by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  There's a chance he might increase his offer further, or I might be able to convince him to meet me halfway."
