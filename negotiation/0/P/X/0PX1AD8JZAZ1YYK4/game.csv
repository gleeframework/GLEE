"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $850000. I believe this is a fair price that allows us both to make a decent profit.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $950000. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to drive the price down, but I'm not willing to go below $925000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I meet my minimum selling price. I'm now offering the product to you for $925000. This is my final concession, and I expect you to seriously consider this price.",925000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to meet your minimum price, but $925000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $910000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement, and I'm confident it will work for both of us.",910000.0,Bob,6,

I'm willing to meet you halfway between $925000 and $910000, which brings us to $917500. I'm confident that this price is fair and reasonable, considering the product's value to you.",917500.0,Alice,7,
