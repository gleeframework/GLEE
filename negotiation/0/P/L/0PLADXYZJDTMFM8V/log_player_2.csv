{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my maximum budget. I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in this product, but  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That would be a great starting point for us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $880,000, which is still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is close to my counteroffer of $875,000. This is a good deal for me, as it's well below my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or me running out of rounds is high. It's time to accept and secure the product."
