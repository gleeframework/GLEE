"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in this product, but  $950,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $850,000?  That would be a great starting point for us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $880,000, which is still a bit above my minimum, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,
