"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with an ambitious offer, aiming for a 25% profit. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to negotiate. This strategy could lead to a quick deal if Bob is eager, or it might encourage him to make a counteroffer, setting the stage for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still hoping to get more. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I want to see if we can reach a compromise before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually decreasing my offer, but not too quickly. I'm confident that Bob is interested, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will be enticing enough for him to accept. This price represents a good compromise for both of us, and it's still above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to what I'm looking for.  While I would like a bit more, it's getting close to my initial target of $1,500,000. I don't want to risk losing the deal and then having to accept John's offer at my minimum price.  I'll accept this offer and secure a good profit."
