Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I want to make a deal, $9,500 is too low. I'll try to counter with a price closer to my desired amount."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? I'm still willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $10,000 is still a good deal, and it avoids the risk of losing the sale altogether."
