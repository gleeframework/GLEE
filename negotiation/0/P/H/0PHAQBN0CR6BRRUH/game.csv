"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get a fair price. What do you say?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair deal for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
