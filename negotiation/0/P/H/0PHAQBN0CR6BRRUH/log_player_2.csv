"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $175. It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree it's a great product, $175 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, which might seem aggressive. However, it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It allows for Alice to counter and for you to potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Establishes your price range:** Alice now knows you're looking for a deal significantly lower than her initial asking price.
* **Keeps the John option open:** If Alice completely rejects this offer, you can still choose to buy from John for $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to come down to $120.  This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get a fair price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $100?  That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 100
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meet your limit:** This offer hits your maximum budget.
* **Fairness:** You can frame it as a win-win, splitting the difference between her last offer and your previous one. 
* **Pressure point:** Alice knows you have the John option, so this offer might be tempting to avoid losing the sale."
