Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $14,000.  I think it's a fair price considering what it could do for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning listing it publicly implies scarcity and might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**Important:** While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, we don't want to reveal this information to Bob. Our goal is to get the best price from Bob first."
