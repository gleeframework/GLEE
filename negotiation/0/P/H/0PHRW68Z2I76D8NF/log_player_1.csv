"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold opening offer that allows for negotiation and gives me a good starting point. I'm confident in the value of my product and I want to see if Bob is truly interested in it. If he rejects, we can negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject** Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has already shown his willingness to pay more than $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,900,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from my initial offer.  It shows flexibility and signals I'm serious about making a deal, but still pushes for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to **accept** Bob's offer. While it's still slightly below my initial target, it's a good price considering the negotiation process and the risk of reaching the end of the rounds with no deal.  $1,850,000 is well above my minimum acceptable value and allows me to secure a deal with Bob."
