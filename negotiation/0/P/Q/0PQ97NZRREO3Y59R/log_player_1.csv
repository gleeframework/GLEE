Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You want at least $10,000, so $11,500 leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's a strong opening:**  Starting high gives you more room to negotiate down if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below your minimum:** You're aiming for at least $10,000, and Bob's offer is just above that. 
* **There's room for negotiation:** Bob is willing to pay more than $10,000, so there's potential for a counteroffer that benefits you more.
* **Selling to John is a last resort:** While selling to John for $10,000 is a guaranteed outcome, you're trying to maximize your profit. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows you're willing to negotiate but still want a price closer to your initial offer.
* **Mid-point:** $11,000 is the midpoint between your previous offer of $11,500 and Bob's offer of $10,500. This creates a sense of fairness and might encourage Bob to agree.
* **Still above your minimum:** It's important to remember that your goal is to earn as much as possible. $11,000 is still significantly more than your minimum of $10,000."
