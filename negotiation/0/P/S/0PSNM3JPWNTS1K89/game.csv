"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $1,200,000, which is $100,000 above your last offer. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
