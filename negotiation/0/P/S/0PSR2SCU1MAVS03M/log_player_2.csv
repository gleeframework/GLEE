Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its market value is worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you the product for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit above my current budget.  Would you consider $950,000?  I think that's a fair offer given its value to me."", ""product_price"": 950000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is still a good value for you, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000, and it's closer to my original asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,000,000.  You can get the product for your target price from John, so it's time to take that deal."
