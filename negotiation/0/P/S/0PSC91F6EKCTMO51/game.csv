"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $8,000.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking for a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I believe the product is valuable, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $9,000? That's a fair offer, and it allows you to still make a good profit.",9000.0,Bob,4,
