Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves some space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Above Minimum:** The price is comfortably above your $10,000 minimum, ensuring a profit even if Bob negotiates down slightly. 
* **Alternative Option:** You have the safety net of John's offer ($10,000) if Bob outright rejects this proposal."
