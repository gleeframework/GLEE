Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $120 is the highest you can go, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about I offer it to you for $130?

It's unlikely Alice will go down to $120.  She's already shown she's willing to negotiate, but at this point, taking the guaranteed deal from John is the best move to maximize savings."
