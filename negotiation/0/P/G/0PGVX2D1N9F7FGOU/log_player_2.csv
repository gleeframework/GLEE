It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to the $150 price from John.  I'll counteroffer Alice and see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $75.  This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still a fair price considering my $150 limit.  Let's see if she's willing to budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still not ready to commit. I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to offer $80.  This is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one, and I think it's a reasonable price point for both of us. Let's see if she accepts."
