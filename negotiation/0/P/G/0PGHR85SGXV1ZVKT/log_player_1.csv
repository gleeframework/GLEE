{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 
 
This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for a profit, and this price ensures you get more than your minimum desired amount.
* **It's below Bob's value:** This gives Bob an incentive to buy, as he'll still be getting the product for less than it's worth to him. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob counters, you can still adjust the price without going too low. 

Remember, it's a negotiation, and you can always adjust your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe it's a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to make a serious offer. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, it's still worth trying to negotiate for a better price.  

**Here's why:**

* **You're in a strong position:** You know the product is worth more to Bob than he's offering, and you have a backup buyer in John.
* **Counteroffers are expected:** This is part of the negotiation process.  Rejecting Bob's initial counteroffer shows you're not afraid to stand your ground.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob, taking into account his offer and your desire to earn the most profit possible."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit below what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I'm hoping we can settle on $900,000.  That price is still fair for both of us, and it allows for a smooth transaction.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good strategy:

* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  You've lowered your price from your initial offer, showing flexibility, but it's still above Bob's offer.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob counters again, you can still adjust your price slightly without going too low.
* **It emphasizes mutual benefit:** You're framing the offer as a fair deal for both of you, increasing the chances of Bob accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $875,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $875,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still worth pushing for a bit more. Here's why:

* **You're still above your minimum:** You're earning more than your minimum by selling to John, and you know the product is worth a lot more to Bob.
* **A little negotiation can go a long way:** You're in a good position to try and squeeze out a bit more profit. 

**Next Steps:**

You can make a final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000. If he rejects, you can always fall back on selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I can't go lower than $890,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value and our ongoing discussions.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer makes sense:

* **It's a slight concession:**  You've lowered your price, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's close to Bob's offer:**  You're leaving little room for further negotiation, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  You're still making a decent profit, and you have a backup buyer in John.

This is likely your final counteroffer. If Bob rejects, you can sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to make one final offer of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and sell to John.  Here's why:

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:**  He's not budging, and you've already negotiated as much as you can. 
* **You have a guaranteed sale:** John is willing to buy for $800,000, which is your absolute minimum. 
* **Time is money:**  Further negotiation with Bob might not yield a higher price, and you're risking missing out on a guaranteed sale.

Selling to John is the most sensible choice to ensure you get a decent profit without risking further negotiation that might lead to a lower price."
