"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $1,000,000 offer. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value we've both placed on the product.  Let's try to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the $1,100,000 offer. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's try $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit high.  Considering the value we've both placed on the product, I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Bob. However, I'm still not getting the price I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession. Let's try $1,200,000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value I've placed on the product.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $1,175,000.  It's a fair price considering the value we've both placed on the product and it shows I'm serious about making this deal happen.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,200,000. I've already made significant concessions to try to reach an agreement. If we can't meet at this price, I'm willing to consider other options. Let's try one last time: $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
