Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm going to start with a price of $90. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'll be prepared to negotiate from here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to counter with $85. This is still above Bob's offer but closer to his valuation, and I think it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $78 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I think I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 82}
```

I'm going to counter with $82.  This is a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $79. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $79
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $80. While Bob's offer of $79 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough for me.  It's better to take the guaranteed $80 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with less."
