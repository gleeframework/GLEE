Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose an offer of $1,400,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  Let's work together to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,600,000 is out of my price range. I would like to propose an offer of $1,500,000. This might be closer to what you're looking for while still being within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is exactly what John is willing to pay.  I'm going to sell to John and avoid the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
