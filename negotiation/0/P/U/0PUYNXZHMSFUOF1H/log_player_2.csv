"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  $950,000 is significantly higher than Alice's own valuation of $800,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** There's a large gap between Alice's offer and your maximum price, making further negotiation worthwhile. 
* **Risk of buying from John:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is a much worse outcome than potentially getting a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a great starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable counteroffer:** $750,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but it's still above Alice's valuation, making it a realistic starting point for further negotiation.
* **Focus on value:**  The message highlights the value of the product as a reason for the counteroffer, aiming to appeal to Alice's desire to make a deal.
* **Opening for compromise:**  The message explicitly states a willingness to ""bridge the gap,"" encouraging Alice to consider a compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000.

* **Potential for a better deal:** There's still a significant gap between Alice's offer and your maximum price, making it worth exploring further negotiation.
* **Risk of buying from John:** Buying from John at $1,500,000 is still a much worse outcome than potentially getting a better deal with Alice."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

* **Risk of further negotiation:**  With only 3 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation might result in a worse outcome, especially if Alice becomes more resistant.
