Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product that I believe you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $150. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always a good strategy to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be very telling. If he accepts, great! If he rejects, it opens up the opportunity to negotiate down towards his value, knowing you have John as a backup."
