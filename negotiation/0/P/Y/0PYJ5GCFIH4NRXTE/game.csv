"Hello Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $25000. This price reflects the product's quality and potential. Please let me know your thoughts.",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $25000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $10000 for it, which is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is far too low for this product.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to come down to $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and potential.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $15000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects the value I see in the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
