"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide significant returns on your investment.  What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and my minimum ($1,000,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and potential, aiming to justify the high price and frame the negotiation in a positive light.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking for Bob's thoughts, I'm signaling that I'm open to negotiation and value his input. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Ideally, Bob accepts the high price.
2. **Gather Information:**  Bob's reaction will reveal how aggressively he wants the product and help me adjust my strategy. 
3. **Maintain Control:** By setting the initial price, I frame the negotiation on my terms.

I'm aware that this initial offer might be too high for Bob, but I'm prepared to negotiate strategically in subsequent rounds. Having John as a backup buyer provides me leverage and confidence."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price. Bob's message indicates strong interest in the product (""very interested"").  Additionally, his offer is above his perceived value, showing he's willing to stretch.

I'll use the next round to counter with a price closer to my minimum while still leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value. Considering the unique nature and potential of this product, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what's being offered. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've significantly lowered my price from $1,300,000 to $1,150,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate. 
* **Above Minimum, But Room to Negotiate:**  The new price is still well above my minimum ($1,000,000) and provides a buffer for further negotiation.
* **Focus on Value:** The message reiterates the product's uniqueness and potential, justifying the price and keeping the perceived value high.
* **Open Communication:** I continue to invite Bob's input (""What are your thoughts?"") to maintain a collaborative atmosphere and encourage agreement. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Find a Mutually Acceptable Price:**  The goal is to reach an agreement that benefits both parties. 
2. **Avoid Stalemate:**  By making a substantial concession, I hope to encourage Bob to respond in kind and move the negotiation forward.
3. **Maintain Option of John:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, the possibility of selling to John for my minimum price provides me with a safety net and allows me to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $900,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at $900,000 and his counter-offer shows minimal movement. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

Here's my thinking:

* **Time as Leverage:** I still have several rounds left, and Bob doesn't know about my deal with John. I can use this time pressure to my advantage.
* **Testing Bob's Resolve:** By rejecting this offer, I want to gauge how firm Bob is on his $900,000 valuation. He might be willing to increase his offer further if he senses I'm prepared to walk away.

I'll use the next round to make a smaller concession, signaling that while I'm still open to negotiation, I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I've tried to be flexible, and I see that you're serious about this product. To show I'm willing to make a deal happen, I'll come down to $1,075,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a very competitive price for something with this much potential. "", 
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  This offer represents a significant move towards Bob's price, but it's still comfortably above my absolute minimum.  By stating it's my ""final offer,"" I create a sense of urgency and signal that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message reinforces the product's potential, justifying the price even though it's a concession. 
* **Time Pressure:** With each round, the clock is ticking, and Bob's chance to secure the product diminishes. This time pressure might encourage him to accept. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure a Strong Deal:**  My goal is to close the deal near this price point, maximizing my profit.
2. **Gauge Bob's Limit:**  His response will reveal if he's willing to exceed $950,000. If not, I can consider accepting his previous offer or moving to John. 
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By setting a ""final offer,"" I shift the dynamic. Bob has to decide whether to meet my price or risk losing the deal altogether."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to be honest with you, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's latest message is a clear signal that he's unwilling to meet my price expectations. 

* **Revealed Low Valuation:** Bob has finally revealed that his ideal price is $850,000, significantly below my $1,000,000 minimum and my previous offer of $1,075,000.
* **Threat to Walk Away:** While potentially a bluff, Bob's statement about walking away indicates strong resistance to going higher. 
* **Limited Time for Significant Movement:** With only four rounds remaining, it's highly unlikely that Bob will drastically increase his offer to an acceptable level. 

**Guaranteed Profit with John:**  Why risk further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed offer for $1,000,000 from John?  Selling to John ensures I achieve my minimum acceptable profit and avoids the uncertainty of continued negotiation with Bob."
