"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to get closer to my desired value while hopefully remaining within your budget.  Let's keep the negotiation open and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product. It seems we're getting closer to a deal. While I value your time and willingness to negotiate, $950,000 just doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $975,000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while allowing me to secure a fair value for the product.  This is my last offer, so let's see if we can find a solution together.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, as I previously suggested. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,6,
