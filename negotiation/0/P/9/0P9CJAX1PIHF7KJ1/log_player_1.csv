"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm confident this price reflects the potential of the product and is a good deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value. This allows me room for negotiation and is a common tactic in bargaining.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's unique value and potential to Bob, reminding him of the benefits he'd gain. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room to adjust the price if Bob counters. 

**Important Note:**  This is just a starting point.  I will need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and keep in mind the possibility of selling to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob stall."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:** While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  Accepting this offer would result in a loss for me.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is clearly interested, and I'm confident I can secure a better price.
* **Selling to John is an Option:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a safe and guaranteed option, but I'm willing to risk it to see if I can get a better deal from Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price that is more favorable to me, but still within a range that I believe he might be willing to accept.  I'll continue to emphasize the product's unique value and my willingness to negotiate fairly."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I appreciate your interest in the product. While $900,000 is tempting, it's a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000.  This price still allows me to get closer to my desired value while hopefully remaining within your budget.  Let's keep the negotiation open and see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($1,200,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000).  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of the potential benefits he'd be getting.
* **Keeping the Negotiation Open:** I'm signaling that I'm open to further discussion and willing to find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Maintaining a Margin:** While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's offer, it's still above my minimum value of $1,000,000, ensuring I don't lose out on this deal.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  If he rejects this offer, I'll need to decide whether to continue negotiating with him or to accept John's offer of $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000, it's still not enough for me. Accepting this offer would mean taking a loss on the product.
* **John's offer is a secure option:** I'm getting closer to the negotiation end, and I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John.  This offer ensures I won't lose money.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, there's still a possibility that Bob might be willing to increase his offer, especially with the pressure of a limited number of rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly above $950,000, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I'll keep the offer attractive enough for Bob while still staying within my desired range.  If this counteroffer is rejected, I'm prepared to accept John's offer to guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable value."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I truly appreciate your continued interest in the product. It seems we're getting closer to a deal. While I value your time and willingness to negotiate, $950,000 just doesn't quite meet my needs.  I'm willing to offer a final compromise at $975,000.  This price acknowledges your budget constraints while allowing me to secure a fair value for the product.  This is my last offer, so let's see if we can find a solution together."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm framing this offer as a ""final compromise"" to put pressure on Bob and potentially motivate him to accept.
* **Slightly Above Minimum:**  $975,000 is just above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Acknowledging Budget:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints to show empathy and demonstrate that I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Creating Urgency:** By stating this is my ""last offer"", I'm creating a sense of urgency and potentially prompting Bob to accept before the deal falls apart.

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept John's Offer:** If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately accept John's offer of $1,000,000 to secure a sale at my minimum acceptable value. I have limited rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Be Prepared to Walk Away:** I'm prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob continues to be unreasonable.  I'm confident I can get a better deal with John, and I'm not willing to settle for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, as I previously suggested. I think this is a fair price for both of us. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation Stalemate:** Bob is unwilling to budge from his price of $950,000, and I'm not willing to go below my minimum of $1,000,000. We've reached a stalemate.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm running out of time to negotiate a better price.
* **Secure Alternative:**  John is offering $1,000,000 for the product, guaranteeing I don't lose money.  Accepting John's offer is the most logical and profitable option at this point. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't secure a higher price with Bob, accepting John's offer is the best way to ensure a sale and maximize my profits. The risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob for a potentially lower price isn't worth it, considering the limited rounds remaining and the availability of a secure alternative."
