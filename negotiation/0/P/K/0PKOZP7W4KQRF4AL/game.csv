"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is a bit high for me though. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider $18,000.  This is a more reasonable offer that reflects the value this product brings.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  While $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget, I'm getting closer.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I appreciate that.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite large. I'm willing to come down to $15,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you.",15000.0,Alice,5,
