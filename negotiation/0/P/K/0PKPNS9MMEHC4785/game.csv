"Alice, your product sounds intriguing, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1700000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1900000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $1800000?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1700000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $1850000? This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $1850000 is still a bit too high. I'm going to offer you $1750000 as my final offer. If you're not able to accept this, I'll have to move on to other options.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing out on too much profit. How about we meet at $1825000? This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
