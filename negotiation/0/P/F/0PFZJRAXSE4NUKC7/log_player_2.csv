"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $100 is a good price, you can potentially get it for even less. By rejecting, you initiate a counteroffer and have the opportunity to negotiate a lower price.  You can always fall back to buying from John if the negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $90 is a reasonable step. It shows Alice you're serious about buying but are also willing to negotiate. This price is still within your budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
