"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it has immense value and I'm confident you'll be impressed once you learn more about it.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm very interested in your product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1200000 for it. This is a fair price given my budget constraints.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1800000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1800000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to offer $1400000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price given the potential value of this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1800000 and $1400000. I'm offering the product to you for $1600000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating.  However, $1600000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1500000 for the product. This is my absolute final offer, and it represents a significant investment for me.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're making a final offer, but I'm not willing to accept $1500000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $1700000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to close the deal.
