"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you thinking of me. However, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $7,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $10,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference at $8,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",8500.0,Bob,4,
