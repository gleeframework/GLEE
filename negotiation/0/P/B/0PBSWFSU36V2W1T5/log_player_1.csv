Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without him rejecting the offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting a bit high gives me some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate down. 
* **Ensure a Sale:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, I'm still guaranteed to sell the product for $100 to John, so there's no risk of losing money."
