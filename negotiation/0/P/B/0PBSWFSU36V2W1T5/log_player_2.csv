"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before anyone else. I think you'll find it's a great deal at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $100 to Alice, so I'm sure I can find it cheaper elsewhere. I'll reject her offer and see what John has to offer.
