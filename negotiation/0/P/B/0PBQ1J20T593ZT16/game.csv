"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $11,500? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value of the product.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $13,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds for me.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $13,500 is just too far from what I can do.  I'm willing to make one final offer at $12,000. If that doesn't work, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,6,
