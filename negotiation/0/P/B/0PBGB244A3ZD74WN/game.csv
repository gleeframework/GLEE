"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,025,000, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
