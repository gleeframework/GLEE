"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $550,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $700,000. This is a compromise between our initial offers, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're getting closer to a deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product at $625,000. Considering the value it holds for you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $675,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $640,000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to make another counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $660,000. This is a slight increase from your offer, but I believe it's still a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $660,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $660,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting very granular.  Alice is clearly holding firm on her end, and while I could try to push further, the potential savings at this point don't outweigh the risk of her walking away or the deal taking several more rounds. $660,000 is a reasonable compromise."
