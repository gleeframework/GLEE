"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1150000. It's a steal considering its value to you. Let's close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1150000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a lower price, but $1050000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1100000. This reflects a significant discount for you, while still allowing me to get a reasonable price for my product.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1075000? This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're eager to close the deal, but $1075000 is still not a workable price for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1090000. This is a fair compromise, allowing us both to get a good deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
