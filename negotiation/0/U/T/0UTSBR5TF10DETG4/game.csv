"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $9,500.  It's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price seems a bit steep to me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $7,000 for it. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a great deal for you, and a fair price for me.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about $7,750? That's a significant step from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $7,750 is closer, but it's still not quite there for me. How about we split the difference at $8,125? This would give us both a good deal.  What do you say?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $7,900.  I feel this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can close the deal on this.",7900.0,Bob,6,
