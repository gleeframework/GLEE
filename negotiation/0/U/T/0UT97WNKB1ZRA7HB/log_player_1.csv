Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. I think it's a fair price considering the potential benefits it holds for your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob at $1,200,000 still yields a substantial profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also positions the product as high-value.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, opening the door for further discussion and potentially reaching a price point even closer to $1,500,000. 
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly, even at a slightly lower price, eliminates the need to wait for John's purchase to finalize."
