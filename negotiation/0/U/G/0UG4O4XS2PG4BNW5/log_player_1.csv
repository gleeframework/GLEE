Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

The product is worth $15,000 to me, and Bob is offering only $13,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit too low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to pay $14500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, and I'm only in round 4. It's better to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially getting a worse offer or having to sell to John at a lower price."
