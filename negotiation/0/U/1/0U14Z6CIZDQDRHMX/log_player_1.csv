Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  A starting price of $10,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justifying the Price:**  The message subtly implies the product's value to justify the higher price. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different starting prices and messages to see what works best."
