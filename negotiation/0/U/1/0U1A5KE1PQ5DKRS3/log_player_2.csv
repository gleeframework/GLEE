"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,200,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum.  It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  If that fails, Bob can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,050,000 is a substantial drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's serious intent to negotiate while still being within his budget. This price is also closer to John's offer, giving Bob a strong fallback option if Alice doesn't accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price slightly, it's still above Bob's desired price point and higher than John's offer. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can secure a better deal. There's a good chance Alice may be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing his willingness to negotiate while staying within his budget.  $1,100,000 is a compromise between his previous offer and Alice's last offer, leaving room for further negotiation but showing Bob is serious about reaching an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum. While there are fewer rounds remaining, Bob should keep negotiating. He's already shown a willingness to move closer to Alice's price, and a counteroffer could potentially get Alice to budge further. Remember, Bob has a safety net with John's offer, so he can take a more aggressive stance in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to raise his offer, showing a willingness to compromise but still trying to get a better deal.  $1,150,000 is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer but is still within Bob's budget and closer to John's price. This strategy keeps the negotiation moving forward and gives Bob a good chance of securing a deal within his price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Time is running out, and Alice's offers are still too high for Bob.  There's a high chance Alice will continue to ask for a higher price, making a deal with her unlikely.  It's more efficient and cost-effective for Bob to buy from John at this point.  He will get the product for a lower price than any of Alice's offers and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
