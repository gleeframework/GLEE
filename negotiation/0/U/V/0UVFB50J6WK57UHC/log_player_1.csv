"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a starting point that allows for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me. It's below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **The message:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob, highlighting the value he would get. This encourages him to consider my offer seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price. Rejecting allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a better offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I need to stay closer to my initial asking price. Let's split the difference - how about $10,500? It's still a great deal for you, considering the product's value."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:**  This is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows flexibility while still giving me a decent profit.
* **The message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer while emphasizing that I need a higher price. The ""split the difference"" approach suggests compromise and could make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10500 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $9000, so how about $10000? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer and gets me closer to my desired price. At this point, it's a good deal for me, considering the risk of Bob walking away or me having to sell to John for $8,000. Accepting the offer guarantees me a profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
