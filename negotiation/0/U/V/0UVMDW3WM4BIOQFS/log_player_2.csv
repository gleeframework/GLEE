"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $15000. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good deal, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product from you.  I'm willing to offer $11,500 for it.  This price reflects the product's value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $12000, and I think it's a good compromise. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:**  $12,800
* **Bob's Maximum:** $15,000
* **Product's Value to Alice:** $12,000 

Accepting this offer means:

* Bob saves $2,200 compared to buying from John.
* Alice makes a profit of $800.

This is a good deal for both parties. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject the offer and Bob would be left with only the option of buying from John at a higher price."
