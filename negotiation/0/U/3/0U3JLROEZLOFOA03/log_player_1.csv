Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, I'm hoping to get closer to my minimum price of $80."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $70 is a little too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $85.  Let's see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 85}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet at $78? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $78 is getting closer to my minimum price, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $78 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $81.50?  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 81.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm still trying to get as close to $80 as possible. How about we meet in the middle at $81? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $81
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $81. This is a good deal for me as it exceeds my minimum price of $80. While I could continue negotiating and try to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  It's better to secure a good price now than to potentially end up selling to John for $80 or having to make further concessions."
