"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $97.50. Can you consider that?",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price as well. I'm willing to drop to $102.50. This is a compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal.",102.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $98, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",98.0,Bob,6,
