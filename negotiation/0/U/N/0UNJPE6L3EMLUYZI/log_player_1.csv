"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to be offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and after careful consideration, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a high profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  The message is designed to be polite but firm. It emphasizes the product's value to Bob while inviting his response and initiating a dialogue.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This opening positions me advantageously for subsequent rounds. Depending on Bob's reaction, I can choose to be flexible or firm in my next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant sum, it's still considerably lower than my target price and his perceived value of the product. I believe I have room to negotiate a better deal. Selling to John for $800,000 is my absolute minimum and would be a last resort at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe the product's value is significantly higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about we settle on $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conveying Value:**  I'm reiterating that I believe the product is worth more than his offer while still showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This demonstrates flexibility and encourages Bob to do the same. It's a strong negotiating tactic that can often lead to a mutually agreeable solution. 
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:**  This counteroffer keeps the price well above my minimum and maintains the potential for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Thank you for considering my previous offer. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, but his increases are becoming smaller.  $1,150,000 is a strong profit, and holding out for more risks losing the deal entirely. It's better to secure a good deal now than to risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to go with John later."
