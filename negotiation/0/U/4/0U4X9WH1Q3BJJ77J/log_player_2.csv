"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at face value. It's exactly your maximum price, and you have no information about Alice's minimum acceptable price. It's worth exploring if you can get a better deal by negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a significantly lower offer, about 25% lower than Alice's initial price,  is a good strategy. This shows Alice you're serious about negotiating and hopefully encourages her to counter with a price closer to your desired range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still within your maximum budget, but it's worth continuing to negotiate. There's a chance you can get a better price by sending another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate.  By increasing our counteroffer slightly to $950,000, we are showing we're willing to meet halfway, while still keeping the price lower than Alice's last offer. This strategy aims to encourage Alice to accept or make a counteroffer closer to our target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice has lowered her price significantly from her initial offer, and we're now at a price point where accepting is a good option. It's a solid savings compared to the $1,200,000 price from John, and we've managed to negotiate a decent deal. Further negotiation might get us a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject and we might end up with John's price, or worse, the negotiation could break down completely.  Accepting $1,050,000 secures a good deal and minimizes risk."
