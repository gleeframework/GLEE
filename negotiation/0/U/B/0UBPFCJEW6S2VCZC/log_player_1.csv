I'm going to try to get a higher price than $120 from Bob. I'll see if I can make a counteroffer he might accept."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $120 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to accept $135.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
