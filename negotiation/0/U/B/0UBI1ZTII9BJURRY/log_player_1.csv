"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal for you, and it's a price I'm comfortable with. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's valuation of $120, but leaves room for negotiation and potential for a profit. It also demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, selling for $120 is below my minimum valuation of $150. I can do better than that. I'll reject his offer and counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down to $125. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
