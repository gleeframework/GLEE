"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $10,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is still a great deal considering the product's value to you is $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $10,500 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. Could you consider $9,000? It's a win-win - you get a good price, and I get the product I need."",
""product_price"": 9000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer the product to you for $10,000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is already a 16.7% discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

At this point, Alice has met your ideal price. There's no guarantee she'll go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might risk losing the deal."
