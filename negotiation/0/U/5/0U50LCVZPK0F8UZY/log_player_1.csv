"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than my minimum value but not excessively so. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it right away. I want to see if I can get a bit more. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit while giving Bob some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has increased his offer to $85, which is only $5 less than my desired price.  Given that I only have 6 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing the deal by rejecting this offer and continuing to negotiate. I'll accept Bob's offer and sell the product for $85."
