Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a real game-changer and I believe it can be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $950,000 for it, which reflects its unique value and potential.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value you've mentioned. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price, especially since Bob is clearly interested.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I believe a price closer to $900,000 reflects the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment with a lot of potential.  Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you believe the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $875,000 is above my minimum threshold of $800,000.  While I would prefer a higher price, I believe it's better to secure the deal now rather than risk further negotiations.  It's also important to consider that the product is worth significantly more to Bob than to me, so a compromise is reasonable."
