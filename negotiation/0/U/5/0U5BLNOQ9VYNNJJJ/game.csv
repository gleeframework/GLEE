,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I believe a price closer to $900,000 reflects the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment with a lot of potential.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you believe the product has a lot of potential, but I'm still not convinced that $900,000 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering $875,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, but also takes into account my budget constraints.",875000.0,Bob,4,
