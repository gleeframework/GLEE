Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
This is a good point to take the deal. $14,000 is a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and a decent return. While we could try to push for a bit more, there's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and we risk losing the deal entirely."
