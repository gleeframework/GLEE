Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to start negotiations at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can get closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer and try to push the price closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, but $900,000 is simply too low.  It's significantly below my minimum asking price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This is still a great deal for you considering the value you've placed on the product.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $975,000 is getting closer, I'm still not willing to go below my minimum asking price. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I'm proposing $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1025000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, Alice, but I still need to save a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'm proposing $975,000 again. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I've placed on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting frustrating. Bob seems stuck at $975,000, and I'm not willing to go that low. John is a safe bet at $1,000,000, and I'm not risking further negotiation with Bob."
