Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept, but it's still within the range of what Bob is willing to pay. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the likelihood that Bob will accept the offer. However, if he rejects it, I'm prepared to make counteroffers and eventually sell to John if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,400,000 is a decent offer, it is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price. I believe there's still room for compromise and I'm confident I can secure a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,400,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,475,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value of the product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,475,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I could counteroffer again, I'm concerned that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate or a price even lower than $1,475,000.  To avoid risking a loss and ensure I receive at least my minimum desired value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
