Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it's worth a price of $1,000,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, I need to aim higher with Bob to maximize profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,000,000 leaves space for potential negotiation.  Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially settle on a price higher than $800,000.
* **Confident Tone:** By expressing confidence in the product's value, I aim to influence Bob's perception and potentially justify the higher price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes Bob is unaware of John's offer. If Bob knew about John, he would have no incentive to offer more than $800,000."
