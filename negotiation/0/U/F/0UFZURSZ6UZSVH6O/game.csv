"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be happy to pay $1,150,000 for it. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,225,000? I'm confident this product will be worth more than that to you in the long run.",1225000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,225,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.",1175000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its true value and will ensure both of us are happy with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
