"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on it. However, considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a lower price of $700,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $700,000 is significantly below the value I know this product holds.  To demonstrate my commitment to reaching an agreement, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer and should allow for a mutually beneficial deal.  Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
