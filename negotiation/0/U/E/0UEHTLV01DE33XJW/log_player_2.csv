"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're really looking to get a good deal, Bob. However, I've already come down to $120 and you're now offering $80. I'm not willing to go that low. Let's meet in the middle again, but this time at $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very unlikely to go down to $80.  She's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but her latest offer of $110 indicates she's not budging much more. It's time to cut your losses and secure the product from John at your target price."
