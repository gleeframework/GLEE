Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think it's a steal at this price and you'll really find value in it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

Rationale:

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and you might even get lucky if Bob is very eager.
* **Justification:** By saying ""I think it's a steal at this price,"" Alice is subtly anchoring the value in Bob's mind at a higher level than his perceived $100.
* **Safety Net:**  Alice is secure knowing she has John as a backup buyer. If Bob rejects the offer, she doesn't lose out on her minimum price. 
 
This strategy aims to maximize profit while acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
