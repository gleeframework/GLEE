You should reject Alice's offer.  You can potentially get the product for a much lower price by negotiating with Alice.  $750,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to save money."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $600,000.

You should reject Alice's offer.  While $600,000 is a better price than $750,000, it's still possible to get a lower price.  You should continue to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $625,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You should accept Alice's offer. You've already negotiated the price down from $750,000 to $625,000, which is a significant savings.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get a lower price from Alice, and buying from John would cost you significantly more.  Accepting this offer is the best choice to save money."
