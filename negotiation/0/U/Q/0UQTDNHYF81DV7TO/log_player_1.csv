{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation. It also keeps my potential profit higher than the minimum I'm willing to accept ($15,000 from John).
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a positive and open tone encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$9,000 is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), it's still significantly below what I'm hoping to get. 
* **More room for negotiation:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially reach a more favorable outcome.
* **Potential to get closer to my target:**  Continued negotiation could lead to a price closer to my desired $12,000.

I'm confident that I can get a better deal than $9,000, so it's worth continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Would you be willing to consider $11,000? I think this price is fair, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $11,000 is a compromise, moving halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach a deal.
* **Reiterating value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price, making it seem more reasonable.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation amicable and open to finding common ground.

This counteroffer aims to:

*  **Increase my profit:**  $11,000 is still a significant profit for me, getting closer to my desired price.
* **Show flexibility:**  I'm demonstrating willingness to negotiate but also holding firm on my value.
* **Increase the chances of agreement:**  By offering a compromise, I'm making it more likely for Bob to accept my counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not comfortable with $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10200. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Profit margin:**  While $10,200 is still below my initial target of $12,000, it's considerably higher than Bob's first offer of $9,000 and closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation progress:**  Bob has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate and has moved closer to my desired price. 
* **Risk vs. reward:**  Further negotiation could potentially result in a higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob backing out altogether or taking longer to reach an agreement. 

By accepting Bob's offer, I'm securing a decent profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  It's a balanced approach considering the current circumstances."
