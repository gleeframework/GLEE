Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm starting to feel like we're getting too close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I can offer it to you for $11,250, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly very firm on her price, and we're running out of rounds. Her latest offer of $11,250 is still significantly higher than what we know we can get it from John for ($15,000). While we might be able to squeeze a tiny bit more from Alice, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of her walking away and us ending up with nothing."
