"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $180, but I'm open to negotiation."", ""product_price"": 180} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) and also higher than what the product is worth to Bob ($120). This gives me room to negotiate down and still make a good profit.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By mentioning that I'm open to negotiation, I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to work with him to find a mutually agreeable price. This can encourage him to counteroffer rather than simply rejecting the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $100 is far below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and significantly less than what the product is worth to me. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, there's still room for negotiation. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range, keeping in mind his willingness to pay. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $150, guaranteeing a profit. However, I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer with a reasonable price:** $160 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to compromise. It also stays above my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** The message emphasizes finding a middle ground and reaching an agreement. This can encourage Bob to see that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm still holding out for a higher price than Bob's initial offer, but I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and find a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving a little. How about $110? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $110 is still well below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While I'm open to negotiation, accepting such a low offer would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product and willing to negotiate.  His offer shows that he's willing to move up from his initial price, indicating a potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Selling to John is an option:** However, selling to John for $150 would be a guaranteed profit. I'll see if I can get a better deal from Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $110 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $140.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise but maintain value:**  I'm reducing my offer further, showing flexibility and willingness to meet Bob halfway. However, I'm still staying above my minimum desired price of $150.
* **Highlighting compromise:**  The message emphasizes the fact that I'm making a ""significant compromise."" This can make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal and might encourage him to accept.
* **Setting a deadline:** While not explicitly stated, by suggesting a fair price ""we can both agree on,"" I subtly imply that this could be the final offer. This adds a sense of urgency to the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  I could do $120.  That's the absolute highest I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting the Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 meets my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While it's not my ideal price, it's a good outcome considering we are close to the end of the negotiation rounds.
* **Avoiding Risk:** Continuing to negotiate risks that Bob will walk away, or I might need to sell to John at $150.  Accepting his offer ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids potential losses.
* **Time Constraints:** With only four rounds remaining, it's important to close the deal before running out of time.  Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale and move on to other opportunities."
