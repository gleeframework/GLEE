Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000** is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, but lower than my minimum desired price of $15,000. 
* This leaves room for negotiation, but still allows me to potentially make a good profit.
* I'm starting with a friendly message to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to stay within my budget of $12,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for my minimum price yet. I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially considering my value for the product is $15,000. 

By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to close the gap. Selling to John at $15,000 is still an option if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,000 is a fair price, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $13,000. This gives you a great deal, and still allows me to recoup some of my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000** is a compromise between my minimum desired price and Bob's offer. 
* I'm still leaving some room for negotiation but showing willingness to work with Bob.
* I'm emphasizing the value he'll get at this price, making it more attractive for him to consider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $12,500. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. 

I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable agreement.  If not, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12,500. I'm very close to accepting your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my target.  I'm willing to go down to $12,750, which is a good compromise.  It's a great deal for you, and allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 12750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,750** is a very small increment from Bob's offer. It shows a strong willingness to reach a deal while still pushing for a slightly higher price.
* The message emphasizes the ""good compromise"" aspect to make it more appealing for Bob.
* By mentioning covering my costs, I subtly remind Bob that I'm not just trying to maximize profits, but also need to make a reasonable return on the product."
