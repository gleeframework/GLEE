"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, Bob can likely get a better price.  He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm!  $90 is a bit higher than I was hoping to spend. Would you be willing to come down to $75? "", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the price down as low as possible, but he's still showing interest.  A counteroffer of $75 is a significant drop from $90, but it's still within the range he's willing to pay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $82. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $82 is closer to Bob's target, he's still aiming to get the price lower. He should reject the offer and see if he can negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $82 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $80? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of gradually lowering the price. He's making a counteroffer that's still slightly higher than his ideal price but shows Alice he's serious about making a deal.  Splitting the difference suggests a compromise and may be more appealing to Alice than a further significant drop in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $80 just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $84. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $84.  While Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, she's not budging much.  Bob should reject the offer and see if he can get Alice to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying to be fair here, but $84 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go above $81. Let's make a deal and close this out."", ""product_price"": 81}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his target price, but he's still holding firm. This counteroffer demonstrates his commitment while also suggesting that further negotiation might not be productive.  It's a risky move, as Alice may counter with an even higher price or reject the offer altogether, but it could also be the push she needs to finally accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go down to $81 just yet. I can offer you a compromise at $83. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $83. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $83
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved slightly closer to Bob's desired price, and they're now only $2 apart.  With only 3 rounds left, it's a good time for Bob to accept the offer.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but there's also a risk that Alice will reject the offer completely or even increase the price again. At this point, Bob has a good deal that's well within his budget, and it's better to secure the purchase than risk losing the opportunity entirely."
