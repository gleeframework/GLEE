Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $15,000.
* **My Floor:** My minimum acceptable price is $10,000.
* **Negotiation:**  I am offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation, giving him a good deal while still securing a significant profit for myself.
* **John's Offer:** If Bob rejects the offer, I have a backup buyer (John) who will pay $10,000, ensuring I don't lose money.

This strategy maximizes my potential profit while also increasing the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer."
