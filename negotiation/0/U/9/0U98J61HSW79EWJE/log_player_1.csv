Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $90. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $100.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $90 gives Bob a $10 discount (making it attractive) while earning you a $10 profit over your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing the sale with Bob and maximizing your potential profit."
