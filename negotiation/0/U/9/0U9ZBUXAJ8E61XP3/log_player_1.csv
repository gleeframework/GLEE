Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $160 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer, but $60 is quite a bit lower than I'm looking for.  Could you do $140?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and while selling to John would get you your minimum, taking the $100 is a profit and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal."
