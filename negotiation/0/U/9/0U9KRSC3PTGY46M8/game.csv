"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm starting the bidding at $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for something with such high returns.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which reflects its value to me. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This is a serious offer reflecting the true worth of what's on the table.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,300,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product, recognizing its potential while staying within my budget. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
