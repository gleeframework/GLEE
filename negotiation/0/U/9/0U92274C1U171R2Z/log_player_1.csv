"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down.
* **Positive Framing:** My message focuses on the value of the product and emphasizes the ""great deal"" aspect. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  I'm not immediately stating my minimum price, creating an opportunity for Bob to counteroffer. 

This initial offer is designed to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to engage in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter-offer and potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you showing interest in the product. While $12,500 is a good offer, I'm still looking to get a bit closer to my desired price point. How about we meet in the middle at $13,750? It's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find the value in this product."", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between Bob's offer and my desired price, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reinforcing Value:**  I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" and ""value"" aspect of the product to further incentivize Bob.
* **No Ultimatum:**  I'm not making this a final offer, leaving room for further negotiation. 

This counteroffer aims to find a price that's mutually beneficial and increase the likelihood of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my desired price.  Given that we're already in round 4, there's a good chance that further negotiation won't get me a significantly higher price. Accepting his offer ensures I get a decent return on my product without risking further rounds that could lead to a lower offer or a sale to John at a much lower price."
