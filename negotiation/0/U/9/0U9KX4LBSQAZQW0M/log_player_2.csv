{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's initial offer is too high. It's worth $800,000 to her, and she's asking for $900,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me at this point. Given its value to you, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This price reflects a fair compromise that allows us to both benefit from this transaction. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  The counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than her minimum acceptable price.  This shows that I'm serious about buying but not willing to overpay. 
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** The message emphasizes the idea of a mutually beneficial transaction, making it less about a ""battle"" and more about finding a common ground. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for Alice to counter with a price closer to my offer, which would then allow me to further negotiate down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering the value you place on the product, I appreciate your offer. In order to find a mutually beneficial solution, I propose to reconsider the price at $850,000. This reflects a compromise that respects both the value to you and the cost to us.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is closer to my initial offer, it's still a bit high for me.

This shows my sincere interest in acquiring the product, and I believe it's a fair price that acknowledges its value to you."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $825,000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to offer $775,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued engagement, Bob. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm proposing a price of $800,000. This figure represents a significant compromise from our initial positions and should facilitate a successful transaction for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is now at her minimum acceptable price.  Accepting this offer is the best course of action.  It's still a decent price for me, considering I could buy it for $1,500,000 from John.  There's a good chance that further negotiations would get me a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of losing the deal or running out of rounds."
