"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you.  It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I know it holds the same value for you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,000,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's discuss further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.
