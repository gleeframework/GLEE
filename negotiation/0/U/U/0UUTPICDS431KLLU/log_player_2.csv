"Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $100.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget, $100.  While Alice might reject this offer, it's a starting point for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than $175, and I'm willing to walk away if I can't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $125 is closer to my budget, it's still more than I'd like to pay.  I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my target price of $100. If Alice won't budge further, I can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm still trying to stay under my maximum budget. It's a compromise, and hopefully, Alice will see that I'm willing to negotiate."
