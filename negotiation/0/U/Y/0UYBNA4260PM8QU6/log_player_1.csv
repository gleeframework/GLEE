Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $16000 for it. Is that something you'd be willing to accept?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000

I'm going to try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob. I can still sell to John for $15,000 so I'm not risking losing money here."

Round 3

Round 4

# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $16500 is a bit too high for me. How about $16000 is too low, so I'll meet you in the middle at $16250? Is that something you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,250. 
You have three options:
