"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $80? ",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $80 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  That's still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $90 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? Let's make a deal! ",85.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $88.  That's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested.",88.0,Alice,5,
