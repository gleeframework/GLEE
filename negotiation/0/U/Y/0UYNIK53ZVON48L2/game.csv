"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great price considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the investment.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do it for  $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $12,000. This is still a great deal considering its worth $15,000 to me, and I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $12,000 is closer, it's still a bit above my budget. Would you consider $10,000? That's my final offer.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value considering its worth $15,000 to me.",11500.0,Alice,5,
