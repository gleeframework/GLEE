"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While $1,100,000 is below my initial ask, I'm willing to move a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway between my last offer and yours at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
