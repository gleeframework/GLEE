"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation, while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price of $80. I believe it's a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to Bob is $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my original offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $115. This is a compromise between my initial offer of $120 and Bob's offer of $100. I believe this price is still fair, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $105. While I would have preferred a higher price, it's getting close to my original offer and we are already on Round 4. There is a risk that continuing negotiations could lead to a lower offer or me having to sell to John for $80. Accepting Bob's offer now secures a sale at a price that's better than selling to John."
