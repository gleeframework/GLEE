"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to us, but we're willing to negotiate. Let's start at $90 for this amazing opportunity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $90 is lower than the product's value to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $100.
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's room for negotiation, and you're not under pressure to accept the first offer. 
* **Better deal possible:** John is offering the product for $100, so you have a better option if you can't get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $90 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** $85 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing your serious intent to negotiate. It's still above your desired price point but leaves room for compromise.
* **Clear message:** The message emphasizes your budget constraints while expressing your interest in the product.
* **Setting the stage:** This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation and allows you to see if Alice is willing to come down to a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. To move forward, I'd like to propose a price of $88 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing us to cover our costs. Looking forward to your feedback. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight improvement:**  Alice's counteroffer is only $3 above your desired price point. This is a small difference, and it's likely that further negotiation will not yield a much better result.
* **Time pressure:** You only have 10 rounds, and each round wasted increases the likelihood of having to buy from John at a higher price.
* **Risk assessment:** There is a risk that further negotiation could lead to Alice rejecting your offer and ending up with John's higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer is the best option in this scenario, balancing the need for a good deal with the time pressure and risk of a worse outcome."
