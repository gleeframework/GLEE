Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than her initial asking price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice.  He should see if he can get her closer to his $10,500 counteroffer."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000. Even though Alice has made a compromise, the price is still above Bob's ideal budget.  John offers a price that is within Bob's desired range, making him the better option at this point in the negotiation."
