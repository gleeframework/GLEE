Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your budget constraints, $1,400,000 is unfortunately too far below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,600,000? This would allow me to make this deal work for me and still provide you with a significant value for the product.
