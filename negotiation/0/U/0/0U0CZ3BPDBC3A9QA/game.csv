"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. However, $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? It's a fair offer, and I'm eager to make this purchase.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a decent profit. How about we meet at $8,500? It's a bit above your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",8500.0,Alice,5,
