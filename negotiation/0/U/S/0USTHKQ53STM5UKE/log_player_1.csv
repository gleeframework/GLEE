{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $800,000, ensuring you're getting a good profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $950,000 is still significantly lower than the $1,000,000 value Bob places on the product, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This price allows for potential counteroffers and gives you room to maneuver during the negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, you create a strong initial position without immediately pushing Bob away."

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While it's tempting to sell to him, I am confident that I can get a better price. Rejecting his offer gives me the opportunity to counter and potentially reach a more favorable outcome."
