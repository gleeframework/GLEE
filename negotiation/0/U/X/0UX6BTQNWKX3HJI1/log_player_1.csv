Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you!  I'm asking $115 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $100, so you won't lose money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob values the product at $120, so there's room for compromise.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  The offer is straightforward, making it easy for Bob to understand."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I am only willing to pay up to $100 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is a good starting point (it's our minimum), we can likely do better.  We'll counteroffer and see if we can get closer to our desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a little closer to my asking price. How about $105?  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a little wiggle room."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I'm still not able to go above $100 for the product. Would you be open to meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is firm on his price, and while we'd prefer more, accepting his offer is the best choice. We avoid further negotiation and gain a guaranteed sale, ensuring we don't miss out on the deal altogether."
