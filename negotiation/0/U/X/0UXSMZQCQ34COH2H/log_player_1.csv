This offer aims to get a good price while leaving room for negotiation. It's a middle ground between my minimum and Bob's perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,500 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get a price closer to what I'm looking for."", ""product_price"": 9250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, Alice. However, $9,250 is still a bit too high. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me at this price?

$9,000 is a good price and very close to my minimum.  I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John for less."
