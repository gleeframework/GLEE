"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you this unique product that I know is worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. This is a great price considering its true value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's Motivation:** Alice is trying to sell the product above its value to her ($800,000). Her message is designed to make you think it's worth much more to you.
* **Your Alternatives:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. This is your absolute maximum price.
* **Negotiation Power:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to overpay. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her true valuation. 

**It's highly likely Alice will make another offer to avoid losing the sale entirely. You're in a strong position to negotiate a better deal.**"
