"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. There are still rounds left, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 12500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,800

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $12,000, but it's still below it. I'm confident that I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $12,200 as a final concession. This is the best price I can offer.  It's important to remember the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal."", ""product_price"": 12200}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $11,900 is very close to my minimum price, it's still below it. With only four rounds left, I'm concerned that I won't be able to reach my desired price point. Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum price and allows me to avoid further negotiation.  It's a safe and efficient decision."
