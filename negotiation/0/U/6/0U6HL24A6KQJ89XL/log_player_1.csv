"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,800,000. This is a good starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price. It's important to establish a strong initial position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,600,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still above my minimum price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm in my value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to sell below my minimum price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm going to make a final counteroffer of $1,550,000. This is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price, but I'm willing to take a small loss to secure the deal. Since I'm running out of rounds and I'm not sure if Bob will accept, I'm trying to meet him halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not budging from his low offer. I'm running out of time and don't want to risk getting a worse deal in the remaining rounds. Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a secure and fair outcome."
