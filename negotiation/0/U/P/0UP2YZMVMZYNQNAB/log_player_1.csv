{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're very close now. I'm willing to come down to $1,310,000. This is a good compromise for both of us, and we can finalise the deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1310000}

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I don't want to risk going below $1,300,000. It's only round 8, and I have two more rounds to close the deal with Bob. However, I'm not sure if we can reach a compromise. It's better to sell to John for $1,500,000 and secure a good profit."
