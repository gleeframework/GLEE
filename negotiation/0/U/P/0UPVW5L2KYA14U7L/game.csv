"I understand your budget concerns, Bob, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident you'll see a return on your investment. How about we settle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we settle at $10,500? That's the highest I can go.",10500.0,Bob,4,
