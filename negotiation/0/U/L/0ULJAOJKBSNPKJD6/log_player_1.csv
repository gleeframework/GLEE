Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, leaving room for potential bargaining. It also encourages Bob to engage and provide feedback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but my budget for this purchase is limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle, closer to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is my minimum, I can likely get a better price by continuing negotiations with Bob. I'll make a counteroffer to try and reach a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  That's still a great deal for you, and allows me to get a bit closer to my target price."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
