Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it allows me to potentially capture a large profit.  If Bob rejects, it provides me with valuable information about his perceived value of the product.  I can then adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is a decent price, I believe I can do better.  I'm confident that I can convince Bob to pay closer to my initial asking price, especially since selling to John guarantees me $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with $950,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it still leaves room for profit and indicates that I'm willing to negotiate.  It also puts pressure on Bob to come closer to my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's lower than I initially hoped, it's still above my minimum threshold of $800,000 and guarantees a sale.  Continuing to negotiate risks the chance of Bob walking away entirely, leaving me with only the option to sell to John at a lower price."
