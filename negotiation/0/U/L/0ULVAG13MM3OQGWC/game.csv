"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is likely much higher.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1800000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $800000 at this time. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $800000. I understand that's a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000, which is still a great deal considering its value to you. If you're willing to stretch your budget a bit, I think you'll be very happy with this product.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1200000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm willing to go up to $900000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. If this doesn't work for you, I'm happy to explore other options.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer to $900000. I'm still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
