,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $180 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I can meet you in the middle at $165. Would you be interested?",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $165 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's split the difference and go with $140. That would be a fair deal for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $140. I can offer you $155, which is a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's a fair price for the product. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
