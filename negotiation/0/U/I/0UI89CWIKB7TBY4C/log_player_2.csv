"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,200,000.  This saves you $300,000.
* **Rejecting Alice's offer is worse:**  If you reject, you'll end up paying John $1,500,000, which is the full amount you were willing to pay. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most financially advantageous choice."
