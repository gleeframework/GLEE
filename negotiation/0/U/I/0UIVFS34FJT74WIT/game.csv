,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this point. I'm interested in the product, but I can't go above $8,500. Would you be willing to consider that?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is lower than what I'm hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm happy to accept $10,000 for the product. This still leaves room for us both to get a good deal. Let me know if you're interested.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably afford.  How about $9,000? It's a fair price for us both and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  I'm prepared to come down to $9,500 for the product.  That's a significant compromise on my part, but I'm confident we can both be happy with this price. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still trying to stay within my budget. Would you consider $9,000? I think that's a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",9000.0,Bob,6,
