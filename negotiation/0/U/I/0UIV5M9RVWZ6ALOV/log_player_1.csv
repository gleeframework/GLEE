{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this awesome product that's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit above my minimum price, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a bit more. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we settle on $112?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $112. How about we meet in the middle at $111? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $111. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $111
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While $111 is slightly lower than I hoped for, it's still a good deal for me. It's a fair compromise and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
