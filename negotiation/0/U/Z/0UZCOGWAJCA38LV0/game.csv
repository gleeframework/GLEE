"Hey Alice, $130 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in your product but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to come down to that?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $80 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you won't be disappointed with the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $105 is still a little out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle at $92.50?  I'm confident we can make this work.",92.5,Bob,4,
