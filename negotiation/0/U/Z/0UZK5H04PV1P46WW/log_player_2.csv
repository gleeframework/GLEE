"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to pay closer to $8,500.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. He's starting with a price closer to Alice's value ($8,000) to gauge her willingness to negotiate.  This counteroffer is still well within Bob's budget and gives him a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,500 is my lowest I can go.  It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a good price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal. He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, and Alice has indicated a willingness to compromise. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and allows Bob to try to close the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference - how about $9,000? That's a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is staying firm in his negotiation strategy. By suggesting a price halfway between his previous offer and Alice's, he demonstrates a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.  This also positions him for a potential quick agreement."
