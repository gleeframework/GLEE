"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is too far below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This reflects the significant value the product offers. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,300,000 is still a little steep for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,150,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a significant price reduction, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,5,
