"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum value, but still allows for negotiation.  It's important to leave room for potential compromise without giving away too much value in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm not satisfied with it. I believe the product is worth more than $80. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price before accepting or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer of $100, but still leaves some room for potential negotiation. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to pay a little more for the product, as he's already shown interest by making a counteroffer."
