"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring if you can get a better deal.  There's no downside to rejecting Alice's initial offer and seeing if you can negotiate a lower price.  Since the product is worth $100 to you, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $80 is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, showing you're serious about negotiating.  It's a reasonable starting point, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from $100 to $90, which is a significant move. It's a good deal for you, as you're only paying $10 more than your absolute maximum.  While you could try to push further, it's likely Alice won't budge much more. There's a risk of her rejecting your counteroffer and potentially pushing the price up.  It's best to lock in this reasonable price now."
