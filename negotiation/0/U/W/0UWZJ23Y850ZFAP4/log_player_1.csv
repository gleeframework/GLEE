Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm reducing my price from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum value.  While I could counteroffer again, the negotiation isn't getting me anywhere near my desired price. It's time to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $150."
