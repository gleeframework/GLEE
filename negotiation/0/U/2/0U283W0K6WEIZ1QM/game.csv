"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I think the product's value to you is worth a bit more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $98 and $105, so I'll offer it to you for $101.50.",101.5,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'll offer it to you for $108. It's the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",108.0,Alice,7,,
