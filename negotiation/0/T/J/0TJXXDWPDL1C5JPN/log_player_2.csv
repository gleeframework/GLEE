"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is higher than our target price and what we know the product is worth to her. We should try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's opening price. This strategy aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A low counteroffer helps us understand how willing Alice is to negotiate.
* **Establish a negotiation range:**  By starting low, we create room for movement and potential compromise. 
* **Potentially secure a great deal:**  While unlikely Alice will accept this offer outright, there's a chance she might surprise us, especially if she's motivated to sell quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice moved from her initial offer, $90 is still above our target price and closer to our maximum. We have room to negotiate further and try to meet closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  

* **Splitting the Difference:** Our offer of $75 is a compromise, splitting the difference between our previous offer ($60) and Alice's current offer ($90).  
* **Appearing Reasonable:**  By moving closer to her price, we demonstrate our willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Still Below Our Limit:** This offer keeps us well below our $120 maximum and moves us closer to a potential deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. However, I think $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise at $92.50. It's a good price that I think you'll find reasonable 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is making small concessions, but $92.50 is still too high. We need to show her we're serious about a lower price without being overly aggressive. Let's see if we can encourage her to move closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but I have a budget in mind.  Would you be willing to consider $80 for the product?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Direct and Fair:** We're being transparent by stating our desired price directly. This price is also fair, considering it's the value Alice places on the product herself.
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will reveal if Alice is truly willing to sell at a price that works for both of us or if she's set on a higher profit margin. 
* **Time Constraint:**  As we approach the later rounds, offering a price closer to her known value may encourage her to close the deal."
