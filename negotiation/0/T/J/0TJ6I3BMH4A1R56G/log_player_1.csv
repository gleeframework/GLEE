Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $300,000 difference where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to price Bob out.  A price too close to $1,500,000 might make him balk, even though it's a good deal for him.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product.  Given its unique value proposition, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects the significant benefits it will bring to your business."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:**  It's positive, emphasizes value, and avoids being overly aggressive.
* **The Price:**  $1,400,000 gives you a significant profit margin ($200,000 over your minimum) while still leaving Bob with a $100,000 gain compared to his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how much you're willing to negotiate."
