Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could offer it at $150 (its value to me) and guarantee a sale to John, there's a chance to earn more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $145 creates a tempting price point slightly below my guaranteed sale price. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, there might be room to negotiate slightly downward while still staying above my minimum acceptable price."
