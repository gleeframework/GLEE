"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This gives me a good starting point above my minimum value, but it's still within the realm of what Bob might be willing to pay. It's a good strategy to start high and see if Bob is willing to negotiate down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still allowing me to make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a better deal.  I have a few rounds left, and I don't want to rush into selling for a price that's only slightly above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000.  Since Bob is willing to pay $12,000, and I'm not willing to go lower than this, I'm offering my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer and we can close the deal."
