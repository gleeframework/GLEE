Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is significantly higher than what Bob values the product at ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for me.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Leaving room for a counteroffer:** While $1,200,000 is my target, I'm not afraid to go lower. This keeps the negotiation open and gives Bob a chance to bargain.
* **Plan B in mind:**  I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob's counteroffer is better than his initial rejection, it's still significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for negotiation:**  I have leverage as I have a backup buyer. I can use this leverage to push for a higher price.
* **Counteroffering strategy:**  I believe I can still get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where I'll propose a counteroffer that is more in line with my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let me know if you're ready to make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic counteroffer:** I'm moving slightly closer to Bob's offer but still maintaining a significant profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.
* **Clear call to action:** I'm prompting Bob to make a decision, encouraging him to either accept or propose a new counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  I'm keeping in mind that I have John's offer as a safety net, giving me the confidence to push for a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial offer. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Even though Bob's counteroffer has increased to $1,000,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely get closer to my desired price by making another counteroffer.
* **Leveraging John's offer:**  John's offer gives me the confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I'll aim for a counteroffer that is higher than Bob's offer but still leaves room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up with a new offer. However, $1,000,000 is still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. It's a fair compromise, and it keeps both of us in the negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a considerable profit. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair compromise:**  I frame the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  I'm not giving in entirely, still keeping a gap between my offer and John's offer to keep leverage in case I need to back out.
* **Encouraging a deal:**  I'm prompting Bob to make a decision and push him towards a final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I am willing to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in the product while also staying within my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Negotiation stalemate:** We've reached a point where the difference between our offers is minimal, and further negotiation is unlikely to result in a significant price increase.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take a long time, and I'm losing potential earnings by not selling to John.
* **Guaranteeing a profit:** John's offer guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 

Given the circumstances, selling to John is the best option to ensure a guaranteed profit and avoid further delays."
