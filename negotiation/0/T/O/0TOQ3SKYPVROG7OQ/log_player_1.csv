"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and doesn't immediately push Bob away. I believe there is a good chance Bob will either accept this price or counteroffer with a lower amount, allowing us to start a negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm offering $13,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, and it shows that I'm willing to negotiate. I believe this price is still fair, given the value of the product to me, and it could potentially be accepted by Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I believe I can get more from Bob, especially as he is clearly interested in buying. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering $12,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer, and it shows that I'm flexible but still value the product. I believe this price is fair, and I'm confident that Bob will find it appealing and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $11,000 is getting close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds and I don't want to sell to John for less. I will try to make a final counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm offering $11,500. This is my final offer.  It's a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and shows my willingness to close the deal. If Bob rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  We're down to the wire, and $10,800 is only $800 less than what John would pay. I'd rather close the deal with Bob than risk losing out completely."
