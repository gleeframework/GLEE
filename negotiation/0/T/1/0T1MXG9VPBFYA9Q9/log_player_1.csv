""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it's worth a significant investment. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** Since John acts as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, Alice has leverage to aim significantly higher with Bob.
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer is about gauging Bob's eagerness and potentially securing a substantial profit above the guaranteed amount. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Even if Bob rejects this initial high price, it opens the door for negotiation, where Alice can gradually lower the price towards $1,000,000 while still aiming for the best possible deal."
