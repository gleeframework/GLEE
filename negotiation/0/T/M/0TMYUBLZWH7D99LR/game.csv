"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable product, and I believe it's a fair price considering its worth to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $850,000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $825,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
