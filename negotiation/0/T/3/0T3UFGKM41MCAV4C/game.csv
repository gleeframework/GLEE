"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate,  $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'd like to propose a price of $1,000,000 for the product. Let's continue this conversation and see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer of $1,000,000, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,050,000 to make it worth my while. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,025,000 for the product. I'm confident we can reach a deal that works for both of us.  ",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're able to keep the conversation going. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, which is a compromise that should be acceptable to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. While I recognize we're getting closer, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle again. I'm offering $1,050,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation efforts. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be at a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I need to emphasize that this is my final offer. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
