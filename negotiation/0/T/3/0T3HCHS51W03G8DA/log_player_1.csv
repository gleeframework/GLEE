"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's valued at a minimum of $1,200,000 to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  My initial offer is $1,500,000.  This reflects its unique qualities and potential value to you.  Let's discuss further."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm not in a rush to sell. There are still 9 rounds left, and I can try to get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 doesn't quite reflect the product's full value. Considering its potential for you, I'm willing to compromise slightly. How about $1,350,000? This allows both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1250000. I think that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has moved up to $1,250,000, which is only $50,000 less than my last counteroffer. With only 6 rounds left, it's getting risky to keep negotiating. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale above my minimum threshold and minimizes the risk of ending up with nothing."
