"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than its worth to you and still well above my minimum asking price.  What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's still a good deal for you, as you'd be getting it for less than its value to you. Let's see if we can make this happen.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll offer $950,000. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, as it's well above my minimum and still significantly less than the product's value to you.  Let's finalize this deal and avoid going back and forth any further.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go down to $925,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that you're willing to sell it to me.",925000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your position, but $925,000 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and settle on $962,500.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal so we can both move on.",962500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I'd like to add a condition: I'd like a 1% discount for a quick payment. So, the price would be $913,750. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value to me and the fact that I'm willing to pay quickly.",913750.0,Bob,8,
