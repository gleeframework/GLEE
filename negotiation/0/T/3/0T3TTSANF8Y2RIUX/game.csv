"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the quality of your product, $15000 is unfortunately above my budget.  I'm very interested in purchasing, but I can only offer $10000 at this time.  Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints and would like to accommodate you as much as possible while still valuing the product appropriately. I am willing to consider your offer, but I must maintain a fair value for my creation. Therefore, I am proposing a price of $12000 for the product. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still very interested in your product, but $12000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm happy to meet in the middle and offer $11000.  This would allow us to both walk away satisfied.",11000.0,Bob,4,
