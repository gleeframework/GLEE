"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,000,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This classic negotiation tactic allows room for me to negotiate downwards while gauging Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""immense value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though it's more than double Bob's valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:** By calling it a ""starting point,"" I signal to Bob that I'm open to negotiation and finding a mutually agreeable price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Profit:**  Potentially secure a price closer to my initial offer if Bob is highly motivated.
2. **Gather Information:**  Understand how much Bob is willing to pay and how he negotiates.
3. **Maintain Control:**  Set the initial tone of the negotiation as the party with more leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is above his perceived value of $800,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in the next round.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed option, but I want to explore if I can get a better deal from Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but it's a bit too far from what I had in mind. This product offers significant long-term value, which I believe justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** I'm making a significant concession of $300,000 from my initial offer to show Bob I'm willing to negotiate. However, I'm keeping my counteroffer well above both his offer and my absolute minimum, aiming for a price closer to my target.
* **Focusing on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's ""long-term value"" to justify a higher price in Bob's mind and potentially shift his focus from his initial budget limitations.
* **Seeking Agreement:** The phrase ""fair compromise"" aims to frame this counteroffer as a mutually beneficial solution, encouraging Bob to accept or offer a more reasonable counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that we can find a price that suits both of us. My counteroffer is $1,150,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is now above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I could potentially push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that the negotiations could stall. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
