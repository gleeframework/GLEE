It's always worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You can likely get a better deal than $1,000,000."

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price that's about 25% lower than Alice's initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but am also looking for a good deal."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

Alice has moved slightly closer to my counteroffer, but $900,000 is still too high. I'm going to try another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."

I'm increasing my offer to $800,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  Hopefully, this will be a good middle ground and incentivize Alice to accept."
