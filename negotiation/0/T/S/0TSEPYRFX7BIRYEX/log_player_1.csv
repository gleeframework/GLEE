{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than $1,500,000, which is your minimum.
* **It's within reason:** $1,750,000 is still below the product's value to Bob, giving him room to negotiate.
* **It sets the tone:** This offer shows you are confident in the product's worth and you're not afraid to ask for a higher price.

Remember, you can always adjust your offer based on Bob's response, but starting strong is important!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum, and you're still confident in the product's value.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter with a more reasonable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,100,000 is far too low. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. It's still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's try to find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about $1,300,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your target. You're not desperate to sell, and you have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to counter with a higher price and try to close the gap."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,300,000 is still quite low for this product. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it for $1,450,000. This is a price that reflects the value while being within your budget. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
