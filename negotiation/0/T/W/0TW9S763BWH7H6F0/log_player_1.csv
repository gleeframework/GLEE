{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives him some room to negotiate, making him feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This provides room for you to potentially negotiate higher if needed.
* **It's not too low:** A price too close to Bob's value might make him feel like he can push for a much lower price. 

By starting at $12,000, you're setting a strong baseline and leaving room for strategic negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit far from it. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,000

You have three options:

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the deal.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a final counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to offer the product to you for $11,250.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm afraid $11,250 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $8,000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob has made it clear that he won't go higher than $10,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell the product for less than my minimum value of $15,000.  It's better for me to sell to John and get the full price I deserve."
