"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

It's always a good idea to try to negotiate, especially when you have a clear upper limit ($15,000).  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a significantly lower counteroffer gives Bob room to negotiate.  A $5,000 discount is a large chunk, but it's a starting point for the bargaining process. It's likely Alice won't accept this immediately, but it establishes Bob's seriousness in wanting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,000 is a good price, Bob still has room to negotiate. He can try to get a lower price in the next round.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer, showing he's serious about buying the product.  A $1,500 increase from his last offer demonstrates he's willing to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price. This keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice that he's not just playing games."
