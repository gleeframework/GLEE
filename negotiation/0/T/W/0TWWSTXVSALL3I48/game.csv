"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little too high for my budget. How about we bring it down to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more in line with your budget.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair offer that works for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,050,000. I can do $1,080,000, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but still a good compromise. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a price that reflects the product's value to me.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
