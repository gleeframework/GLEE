Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000. This is the lowest I can go, considering the product's value to me and the effort I've put into it. What do you think?

``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  He's already gotten the price down to $13,000, which is a significant savings from his initial budget of $15,000. If he rejects the offer and tries to negotiate further, he risks Alice walking away, forcing him to buy from John at a higher price."
