"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is still below my minimum. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. ",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the need for further negotiations.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to make a deal.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm not willing to go any lower.",13750.0,Alice,5,
