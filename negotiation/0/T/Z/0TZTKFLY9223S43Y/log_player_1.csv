"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $14,000, which is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $12,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still make a profit.
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has a chance to get a good deal. 
* **Keeping the John option open:** I'm not immediately going for the full $15,000 from John because there's potential to get closer to that value with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you be open to $12,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,500 is better than his initial value of $12,000, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round. This gives me the opportunity to try and bridge the gap and secure a higher price. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I haven't ruled out selling to John. This keeps the pressure on Bob to reach a fair deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $12,500 is still below my minimum. How about $13,500? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. "", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** My counteroffer of $13,500 is a compromise that meets Bob halfway. It's higher than his offer, but still lower than my initial offer.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:**  I'm still emphasizing my minimum value, reminding Bob that I'm not desperate to sell at a significantly lower price.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a fair solution for both of us, making it more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I think this is a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the need for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum value of $15,000. While it's getting closer, I'm not yet willing to accept a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to push him a little closer to my price.
* **John is still a viable option:** Selling to John for $15,000 is still a good alternative. This keeps the pressure on Bob to come to a more favorable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $13,750. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to make a deal.  I'm open to discussing it further, but I'm not willing to go any lower."", ""product_price"": 13750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** My counteroffer of $13,750 is a small concession that shows I'm willing to meet halfway. This signals flexibility and increases the chances of reaching an agreement.
* **Maintaining my bottom line:**  $13,750 is still above my minimum value of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant amount of money.
* **Setting a clear boundary:** I've stated that I'm not willing to go any lower. This puts pressure on Bob to make a decision and avoids endless back-and-forth."
