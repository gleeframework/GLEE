"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product, worth more than a million dollars to me.  I'm confident it's a game-changer for the right buyer. My initial offer is $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1000000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $1000000 doesn't quite reflect the value this product holds for you. How about we split the difference and settle on $1250000? It's a fair price that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $1250000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm open to compromise.  Let's try $1100000. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to buy the product and you to close the sale.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer. $1100000 is a good starting point, but I'm still holding out for a slightly higher price. How about we settle at $1150000? This would be a win-win, allowing you to secure a great product at a competitive price, and me to get closer to my desired target.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I see we're getting closer to an agreement.  $1150000 is tempting, but I'm still hoping to get it for $1125000.  This would represent a good value for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
