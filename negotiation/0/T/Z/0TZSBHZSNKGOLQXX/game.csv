"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's value to me is quite high, and $6,000 falls significantly short of that.  Could you consider $10,000? I'm very motivated to find a fair deal.",10000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your understanding of the market value of the product. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $7,500. Would you be willing to consider this price?",7500.0,Bob,4,
