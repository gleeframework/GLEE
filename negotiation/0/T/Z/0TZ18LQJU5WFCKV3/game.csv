"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $87.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $88.75. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",88.75,Alice,5,
