"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $100 to me, I'm willing to pay up to that amount. However, I want to save money if possible.  Alice's initial offer of $95 is too high. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $95 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $90 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay up to $85, and I think we can find a middle ground. I'll reject this offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $87.50.  This would give us both a good deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.5} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $87.50 is still a little low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $88.75. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $88.75 is getting closer to my target of $85.  We've gone back and forth a few times, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by being too stubborn.  It's worth it to me to accept this offer and get the product for a price slightly above my initial target, rather than potentially ending up paying John $100."
