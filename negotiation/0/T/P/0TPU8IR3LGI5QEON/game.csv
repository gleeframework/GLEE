"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,200. This is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in your future.",8200.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value it will bring to you.",8000.0,Alice,5,
