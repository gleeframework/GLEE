"Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further. You can potentially get a better deal than $850,000.  Since you don't know Alice's true value for the product, there's a chance she'll be willing to accept a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer at $700,000. This is a substantial reduction from Alice's initial offer, and it shows I'm serious about negotiating.  

I'm hoping that:

* **Alice is motivated to sell:** If she's looking to get rid of the product, she might be willing to consider this offer.
* **My counteroffer is within a reasonable range:**  $700,000 is still a significant sum, but it leaves room for further negotiation. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I have a fallback option of buying from John for $1,000,000.  This gives me some leverage in the negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'd like to pay.  There's a good chance that we can negotiate a lower price.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer to $750,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but also that I'm willing to walk away if the price isn't right. It's a middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's latest offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 

If Alice rejects this offer, I'll likely buy from John, as I'm starting to get closer to my maximum price.  However, I'm still hoping to get a better deal from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $765,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $765,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $765,000. This is a better price than John's $1,000,000, and it's unlikely I'll be able to get a significantly lower price from Alice through further negotiation.  It's time to accept the offer and secure the product."
