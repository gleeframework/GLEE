Alice is getting closer to John's price, but we're still not at a point where it's clearly the best deal. We need to signal that we're willing to walk away."

It's time to switch to John. Alice is very unlikely to go below John's price at this point. Accepting her current offer would mean overpaying, and further haggling risks missing out on John's guaranteed price."
