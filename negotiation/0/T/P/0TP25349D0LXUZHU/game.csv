"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $9,500. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",9500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $9,000 even? That's a fair deal for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, though. How about we settle at $9,750? This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",9750.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  However, I need to stick to my budget. My final offer is $9,250.  If that doesn't work for you, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options.",9250.0,Bob,6,
