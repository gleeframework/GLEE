"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob, but I'm afraid $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $105. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $105 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking to my last offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping we can finally close this deal.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your last offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $90. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $102. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",102.0,Alice,7,
