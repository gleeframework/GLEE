"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  It's a fair price, given my budget and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a fair price, it's just a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me achieve my target price. Let's make this happen!",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. Let's meet in the middle at $8,750. It's a fair price, and it would be a win-win for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $8,750 is a good offer, but I'm really hoping to get $8,900 for the product.  It's a small difference, and I believe it would still be a great value for you. How about we finalize this deal at $8,900?  It's a win-win for both of us.",8900.0,Alice,5,
