Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer.  While $8,500 is a fair price, it's just a bit below where I need to be.  How about we split the difference and settle at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it helps me achieve my target price. Let's make this happen!

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's offer of $8,900 is still outside of his budget, and he doesn't want to risk further negotiation.  John's price is the best option available to him right now."
