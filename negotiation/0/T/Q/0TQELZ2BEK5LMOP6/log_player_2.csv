"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $950,000. Given its value to you, I believe this is a fair and attractive offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there is room for negotiation. Bob can save a significant amount of money by making a counteroffer.  He should try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I'm willing to pay $850,000. This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to make a counteroffer. Considering the product's value to you and my current situation, I am willing to negotiate further. My proposal is to offer the product for $875,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $875,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It is significantly lower than his initial price point of $1,200,000 and closer to the product's value to Alice. Accepting this offer allows Bob to save a considerable amount of money compared to buying from John.  There is a risk that Alice will reject further counteroffers, but at this point, the potential savings outweigh the risk."
