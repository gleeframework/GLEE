"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe its unique features will be highly beneficial for you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,300,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a significantly high price to leave room for negotiation and gauge your reaction.  My goal is to understand how much you value the product. Let's talk!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my interest in the product. I appreciate the value it offers, but I'm looking to keep my investment within a specific budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $1,800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

Bob's offer is better than our safety net ($1,500,000 from John), but still significantly below our initial ask. We have room to negotiate and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your budget considerations, but the product's value is truly unique. Let's find a middle ground – how about $2,100,000?"", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

We're splitting the difference between my initial offer and your counteroffer. This maintains a strong position while showing a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand the product's unique value, I would like to propose a price closer to $1,950,000. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring such a valuable item. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We are getting closer, but Bob's concessions are getting smaller.  We are still significantly above our safety net, so we will push a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a mutually agreeable price. Let's bridge the gap – how about we settle on $2,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```

We are getting closer to Bob's offer, but maintaining a firm stance. This leaves room for one more counter-offer from him in case he is still hesitant to meet in the middle.  We are aiming for a price above $2 million."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your proposal, Alice. I respect the value of the product, but I am still aiming to stay within my budget. Could we discuss a price closer to $1,900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

This is a crucial point in the negotiation. Bob is clearly interested but sticking to his budget. We need to decide if we are willing to go below $2,000,000 or hold firm and risk losing the deal.  We will counter with our final offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I want to make this deal happen.  My final offer is $1,975,000. This represents a significant discount from my original ask and reflects my strong desire to see this product in your capable hands."",
""product_price"": 1975000
}
```

This offer is a take-it-or-leave-it proposition. We are offering a small concession to entice Bob while staying above $1.95 million. If he rejects this, we will likely walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a price closer to $1,850,000. This would enable me to acquire the product while staying within my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

It's time to walk away. Bob is not budging from his price range, and we are now too far apart.  We have a guaranteed offer from John that meets our minimum price. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob and potentially getting even lower."
