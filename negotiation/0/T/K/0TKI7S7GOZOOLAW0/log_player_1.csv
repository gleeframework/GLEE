{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay. I value this product at closer to $800,000. To be fair to you, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $500,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
This offer is far too low. It's time to start working Bob towards a more reasonable price.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your initial valuation, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I need to see the price closer to my initial valuation to make this work. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000.  I hope this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob is inching up, but we're still miles apart.  Let's see if we can draw him out a bit more before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the gap between our valuations is still quite significant. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,600,000. I believe this is a generous offer considering the value this product brings. "",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your movement, $1,600,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  To be completely transparent, my absolute ceiling for this product is $800,000. I understand that may not align with your valuation, but I'm willing to offer you $700,000 as a final attempt to reach a deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

It's clear that Bob won't budge significantly beyond $800,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer. It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
