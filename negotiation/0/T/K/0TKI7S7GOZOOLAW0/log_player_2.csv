Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your initial valuation, but $500,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's true value.
