Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you want to see if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts.  
    * You earn $150,000 more than your minimum.
    * Bob saves $50,000 compared to its actual value to him.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially secure an even higher price. 

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer. However, with John as a backup buyer, you're not at risk of losing money."
