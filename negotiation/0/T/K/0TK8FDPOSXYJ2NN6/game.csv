"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential benefits it offers you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,200,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counter with $1,225,000. Can you consider that?",1225000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in finding a mutually agreeable price.  While I'm aiming for a slightly higher figure, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1,237,500? This demonstrates my commitment to getting this deal done.",1237500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $1,237,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
