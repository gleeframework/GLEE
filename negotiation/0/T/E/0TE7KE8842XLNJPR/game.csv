"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,600,000 is far too high for me.  Given the product's value and my budget, I'm willing to pay $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that respects both of our needs.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to negotiate, so let's meet in the middle. How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,400,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This demonstrates my commitment to acquiring this product while still staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
