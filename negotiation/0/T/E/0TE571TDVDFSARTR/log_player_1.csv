{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. It's something that could really benefit your [mention a specific area where the product would be useful for Bob, if you have any information about him]. I'm asking for $10,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:** This message is designed to be friendly and engaging. It emphasizes the potential benefit to Bob and sets a starting price point that allows for negotiation.
* **Product_price:** The price is set at $10,000, which is higher than Alice's minimum value of $8,000. This gives Alice room to negotiate and potentially earn more than her minimum value.

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher starting price:**  Starting high gives Alice leverage in negotiations and maximizes her potential profit. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  This indicates flexibility and encourages Bob to make a counter-offer, allowing for a potential win-win scenario. 
* **Focusing on Bob's benefits:** Highlighting the product's potential value to Bob increases his interest and willingness to negotiate.

**Note:** This strategy assumes that Alice doesn't have specific information about Bob's budget or willingness to pay. If Alice had any additional insights into Bob's potential valuation, she could tailor her offer accordingly."
