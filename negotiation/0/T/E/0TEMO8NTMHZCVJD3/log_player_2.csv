"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to own it, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price.  There's no point in negotiating further because you'd likely end up paying the same price, and there's a chance Alice might reject your counteroffer.  Accepting her offer saves time and ensures you get the product."
