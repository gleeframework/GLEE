"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, just below Bob's estimated value.  This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a price close to my goal.  I'm also keeping in mind John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While it's above my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but it's still significantly higher than John's offer. I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm also firm in my desire to get a price closer to my goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my target. I'm accepting his offer this time, as I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's lower price."
