{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I think it would be a great investment for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the security of John as a backup buyer, ensuring you won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob. 

By setting the initial price high, you create the best chance of maximizing your profit while minimizing the risk of losing the sale entirely."
