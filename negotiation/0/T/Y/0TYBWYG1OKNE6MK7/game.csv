"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I'm confident that this product will exceed your expectations and provide a significant return on your investment. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. I believe this price point represents a fair offer while acknowledging the value this product brings.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I can tell this product means a lot to you, and I do see its value.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to, and $1,200,000 is the highest I can go.  If that works for you, we have a deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that reflects the value of this product.  While your budget is understandable, I can't accept a price that low. Let's meet in the middle - would you consider $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,325,000?  That's my final offer.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
