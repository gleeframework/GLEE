"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

Alice's offer of $180 is higher than your maximum budget of $150. John offers the product for $150, which is within your budget.  Therefore, it makes more sense to buy from John."
