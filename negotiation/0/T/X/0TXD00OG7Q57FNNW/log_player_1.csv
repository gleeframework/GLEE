Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) to maximize our profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,400,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting us even closer to his maximum valuation.
* **Secure the Sale:**  While we could push for a higher price, there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  Selling to John at $1,200,000 is our guaranteed minimum, so securing a deal with Bob above that is ideal."
