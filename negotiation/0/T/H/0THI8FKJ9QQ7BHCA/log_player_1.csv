"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm hoping Bob will find it attractive, but I'm prepared to negotiate if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can do better. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $135. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob has increased his offer to $125. This is getting closer to my desired price and is significantly better than selling to John. I'm going to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
