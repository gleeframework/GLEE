Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $11,000 gives Bob a potential savings of $1,000, making it a tempting deal. This price also allows you to maximize your profit compared to selling to John.

By starting high, you leave room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer."
