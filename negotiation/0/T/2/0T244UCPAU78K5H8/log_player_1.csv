"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $6,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $8,000 for this product.  Would you consider that?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
