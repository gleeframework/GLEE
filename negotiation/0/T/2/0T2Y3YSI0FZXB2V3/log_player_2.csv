"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get a better deal than $140.  He's willing to pay up to $150, and Alice's offer is too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
