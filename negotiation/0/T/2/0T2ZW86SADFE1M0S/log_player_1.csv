Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000. This is a fair price considering its potential.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's potential value to Bob to pique his interest.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to respond. 

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest while maximizing my potential profit. I can adjust my counteroffers based on his responses and the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $15000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a fair compromise considering the unique value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while counteroffering at a price higher than his but lower than my initial ask. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting value again:**  Reminding Bob about the product's unique value can strengthen my position.
* **Seeking finality:**  I'm using language like ""finalize a deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept. 

This strategy aims to get closer to a mutually acceptable price while avoiding the risk of selling to John for less."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is only $500 less than my counteroffer.  At this point, I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price.  There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a lower offer from Bob or that I could end up selling to John for $10,000. Accepting this offer secures a reasonable profit, minimizing the risk."
