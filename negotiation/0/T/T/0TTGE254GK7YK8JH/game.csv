"I'm interested in the product, but $16,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for it. Can we meet in the middle somewhere?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $7,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's a fair price for a product of this quality.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can we meet somewhere in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low.  How about we settle at $12,000? That's a very fair offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $12,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,6,
