Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $1,200,000, so this leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has incentive to accept.
* **It shows confidence:** You're not starting too low, demonstrating you believe in the product's worth.

This allows for potential negotiation and leaves room to either accept a counteroffer or sell to John if Bob becomes too difficult."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. It's still a significant investment, but I think that's a fair price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still a significant drop from your initial offer. There's room for negotiation, and you might be able to secure a higher price. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you can:

* **Show your commitment to your initial value:** This demonstrates that you believe in the product's worth.
* **Maintain leverage:**  You can use your counteroffer to push for a more favorable price.
* **See if Bob is truly interested:** If Bob is willing to walk away, it might be a sign that he doesn't value the product as highly as he initially stated.

You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your initial offer, but still below Bob's value, to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we split the difference at $1,375,000? It's a fair price that acknowledges both our needs. "", ""product_price"": 1375000}
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Splits the difference:**  It finds a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Remains above your minimum:**  You're still getting more than your minimum, so it's a worthwhile negotiation.
* **Keeps the door open:**  It allows for further negotiation if Bob is still not satisfied, but also shows you're serious about the deal. 

By making this counteroffer, you demonstrate a willingness to compromise while still maintaining your leverage. This strategy increases your chances of securing a price closer to your initial goal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? It's a fair price that I'm willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While it's a bit lower than the previous offer, $1,350,000 is still a good price.  Here's why accepting is the best move:

* **Close to your minimum:**  This offer is only $50,000 away from your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it could also risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether.
* **John is an option:**  If you reject this offer, you still have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000.

By accepting Bob's offer, you secure a solid deal that's close to your minimum.  It's a good outcome considering the potential risks of further negotiation or waiting for John."
