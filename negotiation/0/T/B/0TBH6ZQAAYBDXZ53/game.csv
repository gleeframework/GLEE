"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, but $1200000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm trying to be flexible.  However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be closer to $1000000. I'm proposing a final price of $980000. This would allow me to move forward with the sale, and I believe it still presents a great deal for you. What do you say?",980000.0,Alice,5,
