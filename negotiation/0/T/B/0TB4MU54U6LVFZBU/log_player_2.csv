As a valued potential buyer, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth $1200000 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further to see if you can get a better price. You can offer a lower counteroffer, starting from a price that you're comfortable with."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the market demand. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal, considering your initial goal was to buy the product for less than $1,200,000. It's a good compromise and saves you $150,000 compared to buying from John."
