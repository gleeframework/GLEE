Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you! I'm offering it for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me some room to negotiate. I'm also being friendly and engaging, hoping to build rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I would prefer to get more, it's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially losing the deal.  I'll accept his offer."
