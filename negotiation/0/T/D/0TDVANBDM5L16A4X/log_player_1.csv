Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.

This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of the product."", ""product_price"": 1025000}"

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.

While Bob is showing willingness to negotiate, his final offer is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and move on to John who is offering a guaranteed sale at my desired price."
