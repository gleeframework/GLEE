"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant value that I believe justifies a higher price. How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true worth of the product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget with the new offer. I'm willing to compromise, but I can only go up to $980,000. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",980000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. It seems we're getting closer.  How about this - I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to explore other options.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $990,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",990000.0,Bob,6,
