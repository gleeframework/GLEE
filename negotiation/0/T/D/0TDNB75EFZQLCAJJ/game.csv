"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $800000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $900000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $750000. I'm confident that this is a fair price, considering the value you've mentioned is at least $800000.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $825000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $775000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value you've mentioned is at least $800000.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering $795000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. This is already a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,5,
