"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little too high for me.  This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the value I place on it. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my comfort zone.  I could go up to $700,000. This offer reflects the serious interest I have in your product, while acknowledging my budget limitations.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $700,000, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value I place on the product. If you're still interested, I'd be happy to discuss further.",850000.0,Alice,5,
