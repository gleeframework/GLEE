"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs and valued at $10,000. Considering its high quality and the benefits it provides, I believe this is an excellent opportunity for you to enhance your business operations. Let's discuss how we can make this valuable asset yours. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While the product is worth $10,000 to him, Alice's initial offer is at his maximum price point.  It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to negotiate lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm happy to pay $8,000 for it, considering its quality and the benefits it offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. Starting with a significant counteroffer of $8,000 (20% less than Alice's offer) gives him room to negotiate. This initial counteroffer also shows Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't simply accept her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of our product and your interest, I am willing to negotiate the price down to $9,000. This still reflects the high quality and benefits it offers, while providing some flexibility for you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your budget. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is a significant drop from her initial offer. This is a great deal for Bob, as he's saving $1,000 compared to his maximum price point and to buying from John. There's no need to risk further negotiation or losing the opportunity for a good price."
