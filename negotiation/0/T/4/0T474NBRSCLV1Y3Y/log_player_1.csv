Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $15,000 in the current market, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,500. This is a limited-time offer."",
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you an extra profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price of $14,500 is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000). However, the ""limited-time offer"" and framing it as a deal (""below market value"") might entice him. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything. You can proceed with selling to John at your desired price."
