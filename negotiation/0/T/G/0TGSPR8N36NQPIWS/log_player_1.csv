Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering the strategy involved:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, it's always beneficial to aim higher if possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob counters.  
* **High but Justifiable:** The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, but you can justify it by emphasizing the ""unique value proposition"" and its ""potential benefits.""  This might make Bob consider it more seriously.
* **Alternative in Mind:** You have a strong fallback option with John, so you're not desperate to accept a low offer from Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or particularly price-sensitive, you might adjust the starting price slightly lower.
* **Product Details:** The nature of the product and its specific benefits to Bob might influence your messaging."
