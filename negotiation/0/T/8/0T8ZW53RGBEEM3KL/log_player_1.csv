``` 

I'm starting with a price of $2,000,000. This gives me a good margin while still potentially being attractive to Bob. I'll see if he bites, and if not, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for that low right away. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $1,800,000. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now $1,600,000, which is significantly closer to my desired price than my initial offer.  It's above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, so it's a good deal for me. I'll accept his offer and sell the product."
