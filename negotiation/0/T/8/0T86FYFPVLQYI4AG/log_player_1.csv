"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $140, which is still lower than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:** My message is friendly and optimistic, setting a positive tone for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 
* **Strategic backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for a better deal:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a higher price. 
* **Strategic counteroffer:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to send a counteroffer in the next round, potentially closing the gap further. 
* **John as a safety net:** Knowing I can sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to keep negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135? It's still a great price for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the difference:** Offering $135 is a compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway while still aiming for a higher price.
* **Emphasizing value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how the price is still favorable for him.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to keep the negotiation positive and open to a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $132? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $132 is very close to my minimum price of $120.
* **Limited rounds remaining:**  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate.
* **Bob's interest:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his willingness to negotiate shows he's serious about buying. 

While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, the risk of losing the deal entirely outweighs the potential reward. Accepting Bob's offer secures a sale that is close to my minimum and leaves me with a profit."
