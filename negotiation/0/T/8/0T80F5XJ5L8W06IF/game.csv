"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I'd get from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth to me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm firm at $900,000.  This is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal. Let's make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, it's still below my minimum. To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's finalize this deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
