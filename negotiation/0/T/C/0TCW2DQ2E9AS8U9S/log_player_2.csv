(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $15,000.
* Alice is offering it for $14,000.
* While this is a lower price, you can get it from John for the same price you value it at ($15,000). 
* Therefore, it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
