""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it would be of great value to you, and this is a competitive price."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below her minimum price of $10,000."
