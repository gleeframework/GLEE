{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a real gem and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $11,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $11,500 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $12,500 is a good deal.  I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and Bob seems to be getting closer to my minimum."
