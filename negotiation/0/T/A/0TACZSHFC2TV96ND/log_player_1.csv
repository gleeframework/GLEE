"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This gives me a decent margin while still being within a range that Bob might be willing to consider, given the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's closer to Bob's offer, potentially making it more appealing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point. I'll reject it and see if I can get a better offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm going to lower my offer to $12,500. This is still a good profit margin for me, and it's closer to Bob's last offer, potentially making it more appealing. Since we are nearing the middle ground and John is a reliable buyer, I will be more flexible now."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Bob's offer is now my minimum acceptable price. I will accept the offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the sale."
