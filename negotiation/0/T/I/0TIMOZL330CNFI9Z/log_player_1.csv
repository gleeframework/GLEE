Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to your minimum price ($150) as possible while still making the sale to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, starting slightly below your minimum allows for the possibility of Bob counter-offering and you still getting a price above your guaranteed sale to John. 
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""limited time"" might nudge Bob towards a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept $149. If you want to ensure a sale, offering it at $100 (his value) would guarantee it, but you'd earn less. This strategy aims to balance profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
