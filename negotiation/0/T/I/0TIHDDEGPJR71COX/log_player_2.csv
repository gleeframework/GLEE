"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business, and I'm confident you'll see significant returns on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.
* **You can still make a profit:** Even at $1,100,000, you are still getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, allowing you to potentially make a profit."
