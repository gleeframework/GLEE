"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer in its industry, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $11000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $9500? Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to pay a premium for the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $10800. It's still a great value, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I really need to stay within my budget of $8000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9500, but that's as high as I can go. Can you do any better than that?",9500.0,Bob,6,
