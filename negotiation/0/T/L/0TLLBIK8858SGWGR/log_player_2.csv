"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to start the negotiations with an offer of $700,000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is good, but it's still above your desired price. There's room for negotiation, and you have 10 rounds to explore better options.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counter with a lower price, potentially saving more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $700,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm ready to close the deal right now at $650,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 650000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $675,000, which is a significant concession on my part. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and her counteroffer of $675,000 is now within your budget and closer to your desired price. Accepting this offer would save you a substantial amount compared to buying from John. It's a good deal, and there's no guarantee you'll get a better price in the remaining rounds."
