"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I understand this is a significant investment, so I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm confident it will bring you substantial returns.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly the same as John's offer. There's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting it keeps the option open for potential negotiation with Alice or finding a better deal elsewhere."
