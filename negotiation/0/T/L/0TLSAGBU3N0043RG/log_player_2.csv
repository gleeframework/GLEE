"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you like to buy it from me for $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price. Alice is likely willing to negotiate lower since $80 is her breakeven. By rejecting this offer, you open the door to further negotiation or can proceed with John if necessary."
