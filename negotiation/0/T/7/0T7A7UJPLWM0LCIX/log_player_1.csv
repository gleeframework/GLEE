"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is better than nothing, I can likely do better. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $120 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a great price for a product worth so much. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $130? I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, but still higher than his, to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $140 is my absolute lowest.  This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I still need to save a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a tough call.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price,  $135 is a decent amount and I'm getting worried that Bob might walk away.  Plus, with John as a backup, I'm not in a terrible position.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
