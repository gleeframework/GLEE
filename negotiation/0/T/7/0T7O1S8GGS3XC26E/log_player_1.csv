"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **High opening price:** I'm starting with a price above my minimum acceptable value ($100) to leave room for negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.
* **Friendly tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport with Bob.
* **Open-ended question:** I end with a question that encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $110 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $90 is above Bob's perceived value of $80, it is below my minimum acceptable value of $100. I will reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation to try and achieve a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm looking for something closer to my asking price. How about $95? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I reiterate the product's worth to emphasize that $95 is still a good deal for him.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** I keep the conversation friendly to encourage further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $95 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $92.50 is only slightly below my minimum acceptable value of $100. 
* It's getting late in the negotiation (Round 4) and it's likely that if I reject this offer, Bob might continue to offer less in the next round.
* While I could try to counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob might reject my counteroffer and then I might be forced to sell to John for $100, which is only slightly better than Bob's offer. 
* Considering all these factors, it's a good time to accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
