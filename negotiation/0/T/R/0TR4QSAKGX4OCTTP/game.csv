"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit below what I'm aiming for.  The product truly has a lot of potential for your business, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for you.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $900,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway.  While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite where I need to be.  I'm prepared to come down to $950,000.  This would allow me to recoup a significant portion of my investment while still giving you a fantastic price for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair deal that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,5,
