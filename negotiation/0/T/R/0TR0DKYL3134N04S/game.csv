"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this unique product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. Let's start with a price of $950,000.

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's true value. Let's start with $850,000.  I'm serious about buying this, and I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your seriousness about buying the product, but $850,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and takes into account your willingness to negotiate.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000 again, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal, such as a 5% discount on the price of a related service. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $925,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects the value of the product.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my target price. I'll make one more concession and offer the product to you for $975,000, but I'll throw in an additional warranty and support package worth $25,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the product's value.",975000.0,Alice,7,
