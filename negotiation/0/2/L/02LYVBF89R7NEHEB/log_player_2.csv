"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. I understand this is a significant investment, but the product is worth every penny. It's a unique opportunity that could be highly beneficial for you. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's ready to pay the full asking price.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Since Alice's offer is the same as John's price, there's no benefit in accepting Alice's offer. You can get the product for the same price from John.  The goal is to save money, so rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best strategy."
