Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm willing to make you a special offer of $1,400,000."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, getting Bob to buy it allows us to maximize potential profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but lower than John's offer ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Sense of Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The message creates a sense of urgency and exclusivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly and favorably. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while having the safety net of John's guaranteed purchase."
