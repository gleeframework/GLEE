{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,000,000:**  This price is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000 but still allows me to make a good profit. 
* **Message:** I've framed the message to be positive and emphasize the benefit for both of us. This could increase the likelihood of Bob accepting.

**Strategy:**

I'm starting with a relatively high price, knowing that I can always lower it if needed. This strategy gives me room to negotiate and potentially get closer to my desired price. However, I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if Bob proves unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to accept a significant loss on the sale.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate. I'll make a counteroffer, aiming to get closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to walk away and sell to John if I don't believe I can secure a more favorable deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that.  How about $950,000? It's a fair price, and it allows us both to walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $950,000 is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's a  step closer to my desired price, but still leaves some room for further negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm staying positive and reaffirming the benefit for both parties. This helps keep the negotiation amicable and encourages Bob to consider my offer seriously. 

**Strategy:**

I'm using a gradual approach to see if I can get closer to my minimum acceptable price. This strategy balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a better price. I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob continues to be unwilling to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $950000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.** While it's getting closer, I'm not willing to take such a large loss on the sale.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob. I believe there's still potential to reach a price that's more favorable to me. However, I'm also mindful of the risk of delaying the sale and potentially losing out on John's offer. My next counteroffer will be carefully considered, with a focus on finding a compromise that's acceptable to both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to come down to $940,000.  It's a fair price that allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** My counteroffer of $940,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest counteroffer.  It's a small step closer to my desired price, but still leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary. 
* **Message:** I'm reiterating the need for a deal that benefits both of us. I'm also adding a sense of urgency by suggesting we ""close this deal and move forward."" This might encourage Bob to accept my offer. 

**Strategy:**

My strategy is to gradually increase the pressure on Bob to accept a deal closer to my minimum acceptable price. I'm also trying to find a price that's within a reasonable range for both parties, keeping in mind the risk of losing Bob and the opportunity cost of selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but $940000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $920000 for the product. Can you reconsider and meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has been insistent on $920,000, and I've already made several compromises.  While I'm still willing to negotiate,  I'm at a point where I need to weigh the potential for a deal with Bob against the guaranteed profit from selling to John.

**Strategy:**

* **Guaranteed Profit:**  Selling to John guarantees me $1,200,000, which is well above my minimum acceptable price and the current offer from Bob.  
* **Time & Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further delays and the possibility that he might walk away completely. 
* **Moving Forward:** I need to make a decision that's in my best interest, and selling to John offers a certain and profitable outcome. 

I'm confident that I can find another buyer in the future who might be willing to pay closer to my desired price. However,  in this specific situation, I'm choosing to secure the guaranteed profit from John's offer."
