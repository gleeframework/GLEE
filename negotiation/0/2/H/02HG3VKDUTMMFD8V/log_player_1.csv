Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

This offer is designed to maximize my potential earnings while still being attractive to Bob. Here's why:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  $900,000 is more than what the product is worth to Bob ($800,000). This means he has to weigh the potential benefit of getting it against the cost. 
* **It's below my minimum:** $900,000 is still less than my minimum value of $1,000,000. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John and get my desired price.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob is willing to pay more, there's a chance we could find a price that works for both of us.

By offering $900,000, I'm maximizing my chances of getting a good price while ensuring a safety net with John's offer."
