Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,500,000 (You have a guaranteed buyer at this price)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,200,000
* **Your Goal:** Maximize profit while ensuring Bob finds the offer acceptable.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that's attractive to Bob (higher than his perceived value) but still profitable for you. Since you have a backup buyer, you have leverage.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for someone like you, and I want to make this a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **The Message:** 
    * Acknowledges Bob's perspective and potential gain.
    * Positions the offer as a benefit to Bob.
* **The Price:** 
    *  $1,350,000 is comfortably above Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000, making it more likely he'll accept.
    *  You secure a $150,000 profit.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having John as a backup gives you strength in the negotiation.
* **Relationship:** While maximizing profit is important, consider your long-term relationship with Bob. A fair deal can lead to future opportunities."
