"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I know it holds significant value for someone like you, and I want to make this a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. Alice's offer is $1,350,000, which is more than your maximum budget.  While it's a good deal for Alice, it's not a good deal for you.  You can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice."
