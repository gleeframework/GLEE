Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's position:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and has a guaranteed sale at that price.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much larger profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes ""exclusive opportunity,"" ""value,"" and ""potential"" to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, Alice has a fallback option with John at $800,000. This strategy prioritizes maximizing potential profit.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If Alice knows Bob is extremely price-sensitive, she might adjust her starting price down a bit.
* **Negotiation Skills:** Alice should be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  She can gradually decrease her asking price but should aim to stay well above her minimum of $800,000."
