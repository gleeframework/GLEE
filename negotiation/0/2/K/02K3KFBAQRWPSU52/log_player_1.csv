Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a decent margin to negotiate, but it's still well above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I want to see how much value he places on the product and gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While I'm happy to get $1,200,000, I believe I can likely get more from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up at all."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is still a good deal for Bob, but it shows I'm willing to compromise a little. I'm hoping this will get Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly trying to lowball me. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,200,000, and John is willing to pay that.  I'll take John's offer and sell the product to him."
