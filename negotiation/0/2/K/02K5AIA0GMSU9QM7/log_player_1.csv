Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the enthusiasm, but I'm not sure I'm willing to pay the full $1,000,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $875,000, but I need to be honest, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that I might be able to find a better deal elsewhere. Can you reconsider?

**Reasoning:**

Bob is stuck at $875,000 and even hinting at other options.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer within the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer means a $125,000 loss compared to John's guaranteed offer. It's time to cut negotiations and secure the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
