"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer for the product is $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's initial offer is lower than her product's worth to her, it's still higher than your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating further to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your desire to sell it."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay.  I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get a better price closer to my target.  There are still rounds remaining, so I'll try to get a better deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in your price.  However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $975,000. This is a significant step closer to your last offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to get closer to my target. My counteroffer is $1,000,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me and its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my maximum budget. This is a good deal for me as I can get the product for the price I'm willing to pay.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures I get the product without further risk."
