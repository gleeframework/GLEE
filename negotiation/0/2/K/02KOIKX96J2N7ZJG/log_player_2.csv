"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to negotiate a bit. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still higher than what Alice considers the product's worth.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $10,500. I understand the product's value to you, and I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, he still has room to negotiate. Rejecting the offer keeps the door open for a lower price, potentially bringing it closer to his target of $10,500."
