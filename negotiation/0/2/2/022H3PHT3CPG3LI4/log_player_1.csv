"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This leaves room for negotiation, but it's still a significant profit for me. I believe this price is high enough to entice Bob to consider the offer, but low enough that he won't immediately jump to his own counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll reject his offer and proceed to the next round to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price of $13,000. This is still a good profit for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept. I'm hoping to find a middle ground where both of us are happy."
