{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000, which is still above Bob's maximum budget.
* **Buying from John:**  $15,000, which is the absolute maximum Bob is willing to pay.
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. Rejecting the initial offer allows him to start the bargaining process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:**  $14,000, which is still too high.
* **Counteroffer:**  $12,000 is a significant reduction, demonstrating Bob's seriousness about negotiation. 
* **Strategy:**  A lower counteroffer increases the chances of Alice accepting, while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and represents a good saving from his initial offer.
* **Buying from John:** $15,000, which is more expensive than Alice's current offer.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While further negotiation is possible, Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price, and there's a risk of further rounds leading to a higher price or even a deadlock.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Alice's offer in this round is the most rational decision to secure the product while minimizing cost."
