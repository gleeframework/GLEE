Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while still exceeding your minimum selling price ($120).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely in this scenario, starting slightly higher gives you a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down.
* **Secure a Sale:** Offering a price closer to $120 increases the chance of Bob accepting, as the difference between his perceived value and the offered price is smaller. 

This strategy aims to get you the best possible price from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the sale to John."
