{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000.  The negotiations with Bob have been frustrating, and we're still too far apart in price.  I'm not confident I can get a better price from Bob in the remaining rounds, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  It's time to take the sure thing with John."
