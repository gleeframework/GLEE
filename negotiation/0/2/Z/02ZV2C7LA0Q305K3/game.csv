"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $8,800 for the product.",8800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our ongoing conversation, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this offer.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, we're getting close, but $8,700 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $8,950.  I've already come down a lot from my initial price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  This is my final offer.",8950.0,Alice,7,
