"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you, and it's also within my price range. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still lower than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Friendly Approach:** I'm using a positive tone and highlighting the value to Bob to make the initial offer more appealing. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** This price gives me space to negotiate down in subsequent rounds if Bob rejects the offer. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I'm aware of the alternative buyer (John) and the $10,000 price, which gives me confidence in my negotiation stance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. I am willing to pay $8,800 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Low:** While Bob's offer is an improvement from his initial value assessment, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  I have room to counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price.
* **Alternative Option:**  I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, which gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to secure a deal that is mutually beneficial."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I value our ongoing conversation, $8,800 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,200.  This price is still fair considering the product's value to you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this offer."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Compromise:** I still have room to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Alternative Option:** The option to sell to John for $10,000 provides valuable leverage.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired range, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Limited Rounds:**  With only 4 rounds left, I need to be careful about accepting offers that are too low.
* **Alternative Option:**  I can still sell to John for $10,000, which gives me a significantly better outcome.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but $8,700 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $8,950.  I've already come down a lot from my initial price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 8950}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm clearly stating that this is my final offer to signal urgency and encourage acceptance.

* **Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the offer as a solution that benefits both of us, emphasizing a win-win scenario.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to reach an agreement. I'm willing to pay $8,850 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds:**  With only two rounds remaining, the potential for a mutually agreeable price with Bob is diminishing.
* **Alternative Option:**  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees a significantly higher profit than accepting Bob's current offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  The risk of rejecting Bob's offer and potentially getting a lower counteroffer in the final round outweighs the potential reward of a slightly higher price.

By choosing to sell to John, I secure a guaranteed profit of $10,000, maximizing my earnings and minimizing the risk of a less favorable outcome."
