Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll be impressed with its potential. I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think, and we can go from there."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your worth:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This forms your ""walk-away"" point â€“ you should accept nothing less.
* **Assessing Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  There's a potential surplus to be gained if you can sell it for more.
* **Aiming high, but reasonably:** Starting with a price close to your minimum ($1,300,000) tests the waters.  
    * If Bob accepts, you've maximized your profit. 
    * If Bob rejects, you haven't left too much money on the table and can proceed with John.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While this initial offer is firm, the message hints at potential further discussion (""...we can go from there.""). This keeps the door open if Bob wants to counter-offer."
