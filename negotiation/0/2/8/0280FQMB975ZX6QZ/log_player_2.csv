"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for a lower price from John ($120), but Alice's offer is still too high for you. It makes sense to counteroffer Alice to see if you can get a better deal before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $110. It's still a good deal for Alice, as it's more than her valuation of $80. However, it leaves room for negotiation and also keeps the price within your acceptable range of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within your acceptable price range of $120 and is better than buying from John for $120.  It's also likely that if you reject this offer and counteroffer, Alice might not budge further, and you'll end up with a worse outcome."
