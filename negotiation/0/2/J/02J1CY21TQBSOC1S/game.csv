"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I value your business, $850,000 is a bit low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we meet at $900,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the value of the product more than worth it at this price.",900000.0,Alice,5,
