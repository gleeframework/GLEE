"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I believe it's worth a lot to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than that. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired price of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a lower value for the product, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to get at least $9,000 for it.  Let's try to find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer $8,750 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer to my desired price, $8,750 is still not high enough. I'm going to keep negotiating with him, hoping to push the price higher. I'm still confident I can get a better price within the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer.  I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm willing to lower my price to $8,900.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, but $8,900 is still a bit too high for me. I'll offer $8,700 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are not increasing significantly, and I'm worried we're going to get stuck in a stalemate.  Since I have the option to sell to John for $10,000, I'm going to take that option to avoid the risk of further negotiation resulting in a lower price.  I'm happy with the $10,000 price and it's more secure than hoping for a better offer from Bob."
