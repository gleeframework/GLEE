"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1250000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product is certainly valuable, but I'm only able to offer $1,100,000 at this time. This price is still fair given the value of the product, and it allows for a reasonable profit for both of us. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for everyone.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, though. How about $1,175,000? This still leaves room for a profit for you while ensuring I get a fair price for my valuable product. I'm open to continuing this discussion to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and it's closer to what I can afford. I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement at this price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
