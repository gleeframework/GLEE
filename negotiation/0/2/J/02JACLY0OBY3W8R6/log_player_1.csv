Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Bob's offer:

At this point, Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer. It's better to cut losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John than to risk getting stuck in a protracted negotiation with Bob for a potentially insignificant gain."
