Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make another adjustment. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great value for the product you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

It's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. She's unlikely to go below $8,000 and you can get it for that price from John."
