"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I believe it has the potential to generate significant returns for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  There's no point in accepting it.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product but my budget is capped at $1,000,000.  Would you be willing to consider that price?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than your initial offer.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,850,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your budget. You can still try to negotiate a better price, especially since you're willing to go up to $1,000,000.  Rejecting this offer allows you to continue the negotiation and hopefully find a price that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm interested in the product, $1,850,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm prepared to go up to $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's try to find a solution, how about $1,500,000? This is my final offer as this is a significant discount already. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is still above your budget, even though she's indicated it's her final offer.  At this point, it's more advantageous to purchase the product from John for $1,000,000.  You've already established your willingness to pay up to that amount, and further negotiation with Alice might lead to a deadlock or an even higher price.  Buying from John ensures you get the product within your budget and avoids any potential delays or complications."
