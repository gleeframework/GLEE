Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $125. I think it would be really valuable to you, but let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $125 is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but leaves room for negotiation. It also ensures a profit even if Bob manages to haggle the price down slightly.
* **Gauge Interest:** The tone of the message is friendly and open to discussion. This allows Alice to gauge Bob's interest level. If he's enthusiastic, she might be able to keep the price closer to $125.  If he seems hesitant, she has room to lower the price slightly and still make a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** Knowing that John will buy the product for $150 gives Alice leverage. She doesn't have to desperately try to sell it to Bob for any price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while still making the offer attractive enough for Bob to consider."
