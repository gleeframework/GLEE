Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message sets a positive tone and makes Bob more likely to engage.
* **Leaving Room:** This price leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially find a price that's mutually beneficial. 
* **Back-up Plan:**  If Bob doesn't accept, I can always sell to John for $15,000, so I'm not taking a huge risk."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Counter-offering:** I'm confident that I can get a better price by counter-offering. 
* **Avoiding a loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest!  $9,000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the tone positive and friendly to encourage Bob to continue negotiating.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While I'm willing to compromise, I'm not giving away the farm. I'm still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'm willing to go a bit lower. How about $9,800? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and not close enough to be a good deal. 
* **Counter-offering:** I'm confident that I can still get a better price by counter-offering.
* **Avoiding a Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a significant loss for me.

I'll proceed to the next round and counter-offer Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  $9,800 is still a little low for me, though.  How about we meet in the middle again at $10,150?  I think that's a fair price that would work for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm but Flexible:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing a willingness to compromise by moving closer to his price. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** My counter-offer is again halfway between the two previous offers. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** $10,150 is still closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's offer, helping to avoid a significant loss.
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and hopeful to encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go one more round. How about $9,500? I think that's the lowest I can go and still feel good about the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:**  While Bob's offer is higher than his initial offers, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Risk of Exhaustion:**  It seems like further negotiation might not yield a much better price. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing time and potentially the opportunity to sell to John at a much higher price. 

I've reached a point where the potential gains from continued negotiation are outweighed by the risk of getting a lower price and the opportunity cost of selling to John."
