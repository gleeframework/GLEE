Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a high price, leaving room for potential compromise. It's also a significant amount more than John's offer, incentivizing Bob to negotiate rather than walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I can still potentially get more. Rejecting the offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my ideal outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $925,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still significantly higher than John's offer, making it more appealing for Bob to continue negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I can still try to push for a higher price. I'm willing to risk another round of negotiation before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $900,000. This is a slight decrease from my previous offer, but still higher than Bob's last offer. I'm hoping this will be enough to close the deal, as I'm nearing my desired price and I'm not sure how much further Bob will be willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price.  It's time to accept John's offer and secure a sale that meets my minimum requirement."
