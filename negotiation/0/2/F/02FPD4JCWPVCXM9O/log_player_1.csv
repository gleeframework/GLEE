Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly unique."",
 ""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,400,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's ""exclusive"" nature and ""fantastic opportunity"" to appeal to Bob's perception of its worth.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and a compelling offer that Bob is likely to consider seriously."
