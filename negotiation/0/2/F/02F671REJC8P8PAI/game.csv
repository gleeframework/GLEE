"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves some room for us to both find a win-win scenario.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows for some wiggle room in case there are any unforeseen costs.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. To make this deal work, I'm offering $810,000.

"Alice, we're getting very close. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $830,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $805,000 for the product.  This is a final offer.
