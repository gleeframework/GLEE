"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a fantastic price, considering its true value to you is $15000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product.  This would still be a good deal for you, considering your own value of $8000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $10000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we try $11500? This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $15000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11500.  I'm still a little hesitant, but I'm willing to go to $11000.  This would give us both a decent deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go to $11000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $11800? This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $8000. What do you think?",11800.0,Alice,5,
