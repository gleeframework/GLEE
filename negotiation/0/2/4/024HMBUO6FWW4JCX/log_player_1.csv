Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I think you'll find it very valuable.  I'm willing to let it go for $115."",
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim for a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($120) rather than settling for John's offer ($100).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $115 is a strong starting point, it leaves a slight buffer for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate. 
* **Create Urgency:**  Mentioning you're offering it to him before a public listing creates a sense of exclusivity and might encourage him to act quickly."
