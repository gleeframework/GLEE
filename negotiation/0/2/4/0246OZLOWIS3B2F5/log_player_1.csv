Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,250,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that is potentially acceptable to Bob while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile or if I should move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000,  there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a higher price. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range. This will allow me to explore if a mutually beneficial agreement is possible before committing to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This reflects the value you've mentioned and leaves room for a reasonable profit on my end. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a Compromise:** I'm not accepting Bob's low offer but showing flexibility by moving closer to his price while still being above my minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, implying he's getting a good deal even at this higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message ends with a positive, open tone to encourage further discussion and potentially reach an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've secured a successful sale.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to weigh his potential next offer against John's guaranteed price. If Bob's offer isn't close to my minimum, I may be better off selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1050000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,050,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk of further concessions:** Accepting Bob's offer could set a precedent for further concessions in the future, potentially leading to a less favorable outcome.
* **Guaranteed alternative:** Selling to John guarantees a much higher price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my desired range, but if he continues to reject offers near my minimum, I will move forward with selling to John."

**Reasoning:**
