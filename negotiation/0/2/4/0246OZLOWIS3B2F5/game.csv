"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $900000 is simply too low for me.  To be fair to both of us, I'm willing to come down to $1100000.  This reflects the value you've mentioned and leaves room for a reasonable profit on my end. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position.  However, $1050000 is still a bit too low for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to go down to $1150000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to close this deal!",1150000.0,Alice,5,
