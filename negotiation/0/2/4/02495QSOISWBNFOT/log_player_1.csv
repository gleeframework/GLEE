"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, subtly hinting at the potential benefit he'll get.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm asking for Bob's opinion to open the dialogue and gauge his interest. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Leaving space for negotiation prevents Bob from feeling like he's being cornered."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product, but $100 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $90 is better than $80, I believe there's still room for a higher price, given that the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Strategic Negotiation:** Rejecting the offer demonstrates that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm willing to continue negotiating. This creates a sense of competition and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price. 
* **Building Leverage:**  By rejecting the offer, I increase my leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to drop my price to $95. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him, subtly emphasizing that the price I'm offering is still a good deal.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm using language like ""meet in the middle"" to encourage Bob to see the offer as a fair compromise.
* **Time Pressure:** By subtly mentioning ""closing the deal"", I'm adding a slight sense of time pressure, encouraging Bob to make a decision."
