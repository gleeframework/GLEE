"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll really appreciate.  My initial offer is $9,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This is still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $7,000? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I want to see if I can get closer to $7,500 or my minimum of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your position, but $7,000 is still just a bit too low.  How about we split the difference again? $7,250 feels like a good middle ground.  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, it seems like we're getting close.  I'm willing to offer $7,100 to finalize this.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $7,100 is getting closer, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I've already offered to come down to $7,250, and I believe we can find a mutually agreeable solution closer to that price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there are still rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy we're getting closer. Let's meet in the middle at $7,175. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 7175}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is my final offer. I can do $7,125. If that doesn't work, I'll have to go with John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's final offer of $7,125 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I am open to negotiation, his statement that he'll go with John if I don't accept means I'm likely not going to be able to get a better price from him.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price, and I don't have to risk further rounds of negotiation."
