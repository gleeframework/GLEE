"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. This product is only worth $12,000 to me at most. I'd be willing to pay $8,000. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $8,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,,
