Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. While I see the value in your product, I'm only able to offer $900,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is my final offer, as I have another interested buyer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have another buyer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, the gap between his offer and John's guaranteed offer is too significant. It's time to move on to the guaranteed sale."
