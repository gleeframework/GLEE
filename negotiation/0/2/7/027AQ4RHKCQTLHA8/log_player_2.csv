# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm interested in selling you this great product. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer

Alice's offer of $150 is far above your budget of $80. You can get the product for a much better price from John."
