Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but lower than what I'd get from John. This gives me room to negotiate while still maintaining a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low, and I can do better. I'll reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm dropping my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I want.  I'm not willing to sell for that low, and I believe I can still get a better price. I'll reject his offer and counter again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly. I want to signal that I'm flexible, but I'm still holding firm on a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not enough.  I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk going lower than my desired price.  I'm better off selling to John and getting my desired price."
