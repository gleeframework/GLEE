"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $180. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's initial offer is too high.  You're willing to pay a maximum of $120, and her offer is $60 above that.  It's better to counteroffer and see if you can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I really appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, $180 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $180 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $150? I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's counteroffer is still $30 above your maximum budget. While she's willing to compromise, it's not enough for you. You've already made it clear you're only willing to pay $120, and further negotiation might not yield a better outcome. It's more efficient to simply buy from John at your desired price."
