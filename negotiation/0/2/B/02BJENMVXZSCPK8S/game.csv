"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $80, but I'd like to propose an even lower price of $78. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",78.0,Bob,4,,

"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $78 and $85, which is $81.5. However, I can round it up to $82 to make it easier for you to decide.",82.0,Alice,5,,
