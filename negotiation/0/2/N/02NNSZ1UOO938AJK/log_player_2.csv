Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. I'd like to offer you the product for $125 instead of $110, which is still below its value to you. This would allow us to reach a fair compromise.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $123 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while still ensuring a good return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $123. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $123
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now. While I'd prefer to pay less, $123 is a reasonable price and a good compromise. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk the negotiation breaking down and having to pay John $150."
