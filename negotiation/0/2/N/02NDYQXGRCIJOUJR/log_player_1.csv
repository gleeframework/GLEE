{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours before I consider other offers."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a range very profitable for Alice.
* **Time Pressure:**  The 24-hour limit creates urgency for Bob to act before losing the deal.
* **Alternative Option:** While John provides a safety net at $800,000, the focus is to secure the higher offer from Bob first."
