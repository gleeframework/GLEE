"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $8,500. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,000, which is a compromise between our initial offers. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  That's a significant price reduction from your initial offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,000. I'm willing to consider a price of $11,200, which is still a compromise, but closer to my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11200.0,Alice,5,
