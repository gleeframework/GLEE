"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $6,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer. How about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and I'm willing to work with you. $7,250 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,000. This is my final offer, as it's the minimum I'm willing to accept. Let me know if you're interested.",8000.0,Alice,5,
