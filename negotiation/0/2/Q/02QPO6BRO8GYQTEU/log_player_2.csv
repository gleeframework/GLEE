Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $900,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to get as close to my $1,000,000 limit as possible while still leaving some room for Alice to feel like she's getting a fair deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice is being stubborn. I've made my final offer, and she's still not budging. I'm going to buy from John. It's not ideal, but it's the best option for me at this point."
