"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the potential of this product, $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay up to $800000, which is my maximum.  Let me know if you're open to discussing this price further.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $800000 is significantly below my asking price, I'm willing to compromise to facilitate a deal. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1200000. This represents a substantial reduction from my initial offer and leaves room for further discussion. Let me know your thoughts on this revised offer.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1200000 is still a bit high for me.  Given my budget limitations, I'm offering $900000.  This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,4,
