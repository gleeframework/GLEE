"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we settle around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still not comfortable going that high. How about we split the difference again and land at $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time I'll only go up to $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
