"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $165. It's a great compromise, if you ask me!",165.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to drop the price to $160, but I think it's still a great value for the product. It's a unique item, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,5,
