"Thanks for your response, Bob. I understand your perspective, but the product is quite valuable. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This feels like a fair price considering what it offers.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is too low for me to consider, but I'm getting closer to your price range to make this work. Would you be willing to meet at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,5,
