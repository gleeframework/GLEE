Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  It has considerable value beyond even your initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,200,000 is still considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.
