To kick off our negotiations, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point, considering its potential value to you.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,100,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept for this product.  It has considerable value beyond even your initial assessment.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to part with it for $1,325,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects its true worth."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1,325,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me and the market price of similar products.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be firm on this. The product's value is undeniable, and $1,200,000 is still considerably less than what I'm willing to accept.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,275,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,225,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value to me and the market price of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

While a higher price might be possible, Bob is consistently moving upwards, and we're already well above John's offer. Accepting $1,225,000 guarantees a significant profit without risking the deal falling apart."
