It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first.  You can likely get a better price than $130."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $110 is lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to come down to $120.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.
