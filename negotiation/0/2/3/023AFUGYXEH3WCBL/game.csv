"Thanks for the offer, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know if that's something you'd consider.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $120. Let me know if that's more to your liking.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $120, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to pay $100.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to buy the product at that price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know if that's more acceptable to you.",140.0,Alice,5,
