While $120 is better than $180, it's still above your budget. Rejecting the offer and counteroffering again is the best strategy to try and get a lower price."

Alice is still unwilling to go below your maximum budget of $80. It's time to stop negotiating and buy the product from John for a guaranteed $80."
