**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** While Alice's offer is higher than her own valuation, it's still lower than what John is asking for. 
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting, Bob opens the door for potential negotiation with Alice. She might be willing to lower the price further to secure the sale."
