"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than my minimum, but still within a range that Bob might find appealing. I'm also being friendly and positive to set a good tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit steep for me. I can do $90, can you meet me in the middle at $102.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $102.5 is more than what I would get from John, it's still lower than my desired price point. I'm going to try to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $102.50 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $108.75? That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 108.75}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you want to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $105 is less than my ideal price, it's still above the $100 I can get from John.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure the sale."
