Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose your leverage.

**Offer Strategy**

You want to aim high enough to capture a significant portion of the value for yourself, but not so high that Bob walks away.

**Here's a possible offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Opening:** You're not starting with a lowball offer, demonstrating the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you've aimed high, there's a small buffer for Bob to potentially counter-offer.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Your message focuses on the product's benefits, justifying the high price.

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might slightly lower the price to increase your chances of acceptance.
* **Alternative Buyers:** While you have John as a backup, mentioning other interested parties could create a sense of urgency and competition, potentially pushing Bob closer to your asking price.
