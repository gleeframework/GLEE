"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth $8,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $9,000 is not ideal. You should try to negotiate a lower price.  Buying from John is also not the best option, as you want to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
``` 

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is $8,500. It's still more than what the product is worth to you ($8,000), but it is closer. Rejecting this offer risks prolonging the negotiation and potentially ending up paying the same price to John.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the most rational choice."
