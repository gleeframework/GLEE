Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with the maximum price I'm willing to accept, knowing that I have a guaranteed backup offer from John. This puts the pressure on Bob to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000.  This is a compromise from my initial offer but still significantly higher than Bob's offer.  This shows I'm willing to negotiate but am not desperate to sell at his price."
