Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $85 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit closer to my original price. How about we meet in the middle at $100?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $90? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob is now willing to pay $90, which is a good profit above my minimum. It's not worth the risk of him lowering his offer further, or the negotiation dragging on and potentially losing both buyers."
