"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in something valuable. Let's make this deal happen! How about we start with a price of $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your maximum value. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the first offer and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial price, but it's still above her minimum value.  It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation. The message is friendly but firm, showing Alice that you're serious about a deal but won't overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if I can adjust the price for you. How about we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my desired price. Although it's closer to my maximum value, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price. It's better to see if we can reach a more favorable deal before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $87.50. It's a fair price that reflects the value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is again a step towards meeting Alice's price, but it's still a bit lower than her offer. It shows that I'm serious about buying the product but I'm also trying to get the best possible price. I'm hoping that Alice will be willing to come down a little bit more to close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering your offer, I think we can find a mutual agreement. How about $89 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my desired price, but $89 is still above my maximum value of $85. I want to see if I can push for a final concession from Alice before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I really appreciate your flexibility.  I'm willing to go up to $88, but that's my final offer. Let's close this deal and call it a day."", ""product_price"": 88}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small concession from my previous offer, showing that I'm still committed to the deal. It's also very close to Alice's last offer.  The message signals that I'm ready to finalize the transaction and emphasizes that this is my final offer.  This puts pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
