Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value and the demand I anticipate, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher offer allows room for negotiation and potentially securing a price closer to your desired outcome.  
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $15,000, you set a high anchor. Even if Bob negotiates down, it's more likely the final price will be closer to your $12,000 minimum than if you started low.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is framed as a preferential opportunity for Bob, implying the value of the product might be higher in the broader market."
