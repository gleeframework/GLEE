Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:**  You're aiming for a profit and this price allows for that.
* **It's lower than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's a strong opening offer:** It demonstrates you're confident in the product's value and sets a high bar for the negotiation.

We'll see how Bob reacts, and adjust our strategy accordingly!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $1,100,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a good profit for you, it's closer to your minimum than you'd prefer. You can likely squeeze out a bit more by making a counteroffer. 

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to make a counteroffer to Bob.  Consider factors like:

* **How determined is Bob?**  Does he seem eager to buy, or is he more hesitant?
* **Your risk tolerance:** Are you willing to risk losing Bob and settling with John?

A good counteroffer might be slightly lower than your original offer, perhaps $1,125,000. This shows you're willing to compromise but also that you believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $1,125,000?  That's still a significant value for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows you're flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Still a good profit:** $1,125,000 is still well above your minimum, ensuring you make a decent profit.
* **Strategic pricing:**  This price is a midpoint between your original offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise. 

We'll see if Bob accepts this counteroffer. If not, we'll have to consider whether to continue negotiating or take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to go down to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is still a decent profit, Bob's persistence in pushing for that price indicates he's unlikely to budge further.  This negotiation is becoming a bit of a stalemate, and it's not clear if further rounds would lead to a better offer from Bob.

Considering John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000, it's becoming increasingly risky to continue with Bob. There's no guarantee that Bob will ultimately accept a price you're comfortable with, and you risk losing both Bob and John by continuing to negotiate.

**Therefore, selling to John for $1,000,000 is the most pragmatic decision. It guarantees a sale and provides a decent profit, minimizing the risk of losing the deal altogether.**"
