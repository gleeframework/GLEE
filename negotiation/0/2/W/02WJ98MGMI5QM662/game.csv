"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80.  Let me know if you're open to that.",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that 80 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for 100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really hoping to stay within my budget of $80.  Would you be open to coming down a little more?",80.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer of $90. While it's getting closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to get the product for $80. It's the absolute most I can spend right now. If you're willing to accept that, we can make a deal.",80.0,Bob,6,
