"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is way over your budget. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice or go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

Let's start with a lowball offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $50 is a significant discount from her initial price, but still leaves room for us to find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
Alice's offer matches your budget. There's no need to risk further negotiation or potentially lose the deal by going to John."
