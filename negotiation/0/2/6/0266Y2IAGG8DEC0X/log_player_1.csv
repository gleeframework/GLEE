Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,150,000. 
* This price is lower than Bob's valuation of $1,200,000, making it attractive for him to buy.
* It's also higher than my ""Plan B"" value of $1,000,000, ensuring I make a profit. 

This strategy aims for a middle ground, balancing the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the desire to maximize my earnings."
