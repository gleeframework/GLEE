Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,500. I believe it holds significant value, and this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $11,500 is a strong starting point, it leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down, potentially leading to a faster deal.
* **Backup Option:**  I know I can sell the product to John for $10,000, so I'm not desperate. This gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
