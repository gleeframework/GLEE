"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $15,000 is a bit outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,,

"I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value I believe the product holds for you.",13000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  However, $13,000 is still above what I'm comfortable with.  I'll offer you $11,000.  This is a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $11,000, but I still believe the product is worth more than that to me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is my final offer.",12000.0,Alice,5,,
