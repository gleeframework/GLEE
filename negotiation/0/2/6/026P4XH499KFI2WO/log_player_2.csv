**Explanation:**

You're willing to pay a maximum of $15,000.  Alice is offering the product for $15,000.  Since you have the option to buy from John for the same price, rejecting Alice's offer gives you the potential to negotiate a lower price with Alice or find another seller offering a better deal."
