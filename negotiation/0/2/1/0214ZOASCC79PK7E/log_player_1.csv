Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Target Price:** I'm aiming for $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I make a profit beyond John's offer.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While a higher offer could be more profitable, there's a higher risk of Bob rejecting it. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy for $1,000,000 gives me a baseline and allows me to take a calculated risk."
