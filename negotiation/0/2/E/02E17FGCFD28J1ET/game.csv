"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I believe this is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $6,000. I understand that budget is a concern, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think this is a great compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.
