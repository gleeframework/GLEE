Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a price well above your baseline.
* **Gauging Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how badly Bob wants the product. His reaction will give you valuable information for the rest of the negotiation.
* **John as Leverage:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer in John at $800,000 gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to sell, and you can afford to be more assertive in your negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer is already very close to your minimum acceptable price.  This suggests there's room for negotiation to bridge the gap.
* **John as Leverage:** You have the security of John's offer, which allows you to push for a better deal with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more while leaving the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to come down to $900,000 as a sign of good faith. This reflects its real value and ensures a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 900000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $100,000 shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significantly higher price than Bob's offer.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer positions you as trying to find a middle ground, encouraging Bob to do the same. 
* **Maintaining Strength:**  You're still well above your fallback option of John ($800,000), allowing you to negotiate from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Excellent Deal:** $850,000 is a fantastic price, well above your minimum of $800,000. It represents a significant profit for you.
* **Meeting Halfway Demonstrates Fairness:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle shows he's serious about the purchase and wants to find a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Minimizing Risk:** By accepting now, you avoid the potential for further negotiation breakdown. There's always a chance Bob could lower his offer or walk away entirely in subsequent rounds.

While you *could* try to push for a bit more, the risk likely outweighs the potential reward at this point.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a great outcome."
