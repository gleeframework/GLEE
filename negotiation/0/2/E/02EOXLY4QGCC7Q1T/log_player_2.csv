"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's too early to buy from Alice, especially at such a low price. I want to see if I can get it for even cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
``` 

I'm going to start with a lowball offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $250,000 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and it gives us room to bargain."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but $400,000 is still too high for me. I'm going to try to get it closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

I'm going to increase my offer slightly, but still keep it below $400,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying, but I'm not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to my desired price. It's time to take the deal before she changes her mind or I run out of time.  $350,000 is a good price for the product, and I'm confident I can save even more if I negotiate further.  However, the risk of losing the deal to John or Alice changing her mind is too great. I'm willing to accept the offer now."
