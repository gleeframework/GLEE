{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's above my minimum but still allows for some negotiation room. 
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the product's desirability to create a sense of value in Bob's mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The ""What do you think?""  leaves the door open for Bob to counter without making it feel like I'm immediately inflexible.

**Strategy:**

This initial offer sets a high bar and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay.  Depending on his response, I'll adjust my strategy:

* **If Bob accepts:**  Great! I've secured a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:**  I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to:
    * Accept his offer if it's close to my minimum.
    * Counter with a lower price, but not too far below my initial offer. 
    * Walk away if his offers are too low and sell to John as a backup."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your generosity, but my budget allows me to spend no more than $100 on this purchase. Would you consider lowering the price to meet my budget? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:**  Bob is clearly interested in the product, as he made a counteroffer. This gives me an opportunity to negotiate a better price.

**Strategy:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer closer to my desired price.  I'll aim for something like $130, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Keep John in Mind:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'll be mindful of my backup option with John and won't accept a price that's too far below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $130? It's still a great deal on this fantastic product."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by meeting Bob halfway between my initial offer ($150) and his offer ($100).
* **Reiterate Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the price.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using phrases like ""great deal"" to make the offer more appealing.

**Strategy:**

* **Gauge Bob's Response:**  This counteroffer tests Bob's willingness to pay more. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm still leaving room for negotiation if Bob counteroffers again.
* **Backup Plan:**  I'll be prepared to go back to my backup option with John if Bob's counteroffers continue to be too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position, but given my budget constraints, could we perhaps aim for $120? This would allow us to reach an agreement without exceeding my spending limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer of $120 matches my absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **No Further Upside:**  I've already lowered my price from my initial offer.  Negotiating further is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer eliminates the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer and potentially leading to a stalemate or a sale to John at the same price. 

**Strategy:**

* **Secure the Deal:**  This is a good opportunity to secure a sale at my minimum price. 
* **Efficiency:**  By accepting, I avoid further negotiation rounds and potentially wasted time. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Accepting minimizes the risk of losing the sale altogether."
