"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a higher price. $8,500 is still too low for me, and I think I can get closer to my desired price of $9,500."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still asking for $9,000. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. How about we meet at $8,250? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250

``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not ready to settle for $8,250 yet, and I want to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,250 just isn't going to work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's the best we can do to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 8750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we try $8,500 again? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to be careful with my finances.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. Even though it's the same price as his previous offer, I'm going to see if I can squeeze out a little bit more. I'm confident that I can get a better price than $8,500, and I'm not willing to settle just yet."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still firm on a price of $8,600. This is the final offer I'm willing to make. If you're serious about buying the product, I think this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8600}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about we try $8,500? I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and close the deal.

I've reached a point where I need to make a decision.  While I'd prefer a higher price, I've already had several rounds of negotiations and Bob's offer is close to what I'd get by selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
