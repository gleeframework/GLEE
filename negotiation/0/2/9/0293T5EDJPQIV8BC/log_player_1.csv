Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($1,000,000) as possible while still exceeding our minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000).
* **Negotiating Room:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a chance to negotiate further before resorting to selling to John at the guaranteed price."
