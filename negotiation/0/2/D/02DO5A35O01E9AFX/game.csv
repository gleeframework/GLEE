"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and gives you a significant profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1050000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price between our two offers. I'll meet you halfway and offer the product for $1175000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the profit I'm willing to make. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1175000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1100000, which is a good price for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to look at other options.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $1100000, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up too much profit. I'll meet you halfway between our last two offers. I'll offer the product for $1125000. This is a fair price considering the value to you and the profit I'm willing to make. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
