"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I think I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,200 is still too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,700. This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $8,700 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,200, so I'll counter with $8,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, $8,500 is a good compromise and better than selling to John for $8,000. It seems Bob is serious about buying the product, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
