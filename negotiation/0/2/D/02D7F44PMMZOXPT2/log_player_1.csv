Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be very valuable to you.  Given its unique features, I'm asking for $19,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Alice knows Bob values the product at $10,000 and that she has a guaranteed sale at $15,000. Starting with a high offer of $19,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The high price signals that Alice believes the product is highly valuable. If Bob negotiates, Alice can gradually lower the price, still aiming for a price significantly above $15,000. 
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose anything. She has a guaranteed sale to John at her minimum acceptable price."
