"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of significant value to you. It's something that I've personally valued at no less than $1,000,000, and I know it has the potential to be equally valuable to you. I'm offering it to you at a price that reflects its worth and potential - $1,050,000. This is a fair price that allows for a mutually beneficial transaction.  Consider this a chance to acquire something truly unique that can benefit your business significantly. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
