"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. I understand it's worth $1200000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a price that's mutually beneficial.  Let's start with $1000000.  This price would give you a significant return on your investment while allowing me to secure a fair deal.  I'm confident we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
