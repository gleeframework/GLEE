"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to its true value to you. How about $1,100,000? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
