Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to its true value to you. How about $1,100,000? It's a compromise that I'm willing to make to get the deal done.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $900,000. How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

While Alice is slowly coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $1,050,000. At this point, the potential savings from further negotiation are outweighed by the risk that Alice walks away. John offers a guaranteed price of $1,000,000 which is a better deal than what Alice is currently offering."
