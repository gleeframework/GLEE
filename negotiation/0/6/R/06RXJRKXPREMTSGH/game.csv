"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It shows me you're serious, but  $1,400,000 undervalues the unique benefits this product brings, especially for a business like yours.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I still think $1,600,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Bob,4,
