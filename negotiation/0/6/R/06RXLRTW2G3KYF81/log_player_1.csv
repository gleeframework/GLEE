Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $140 for it, which I think is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly lower than what I think the product is worth to Bob. This way, I leave room for negotiation and increase the chances of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I was hoping to find a price closer to $120. Can we negotiate towards that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're looking for a lower price. While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $130? This allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $125 as my offer for the product. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum, and I'm confident I can't get a better price from him.  It's a good deal for both of us, so I'll accept it."
