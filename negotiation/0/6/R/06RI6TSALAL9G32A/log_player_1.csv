Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I already have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Initial Offer:** Starting high gives you room to negotiate if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if he's very interested.

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob. There's a chance he might reject the offer, but the guaranteed sale to John ensures you won't lose out."
