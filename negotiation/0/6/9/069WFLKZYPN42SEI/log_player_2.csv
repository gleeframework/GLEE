"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to work together. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth negotiating with Alice. You can try to get a better price than $1,100,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?

You're still over your ideal price point of $800,000, but closer.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, and you can likely squeeze out a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1025000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

At this point, you're getting close to your ideal price, but Alice is being stubborn.  It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate and possibly driving up the price even further.  It's better to go with John's guaranteed price of $800,000 and secure the product."
