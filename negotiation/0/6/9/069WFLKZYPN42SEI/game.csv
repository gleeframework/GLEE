"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800000. I'm willing to make a slight concession to work together. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, as this is a fair price considering my own valuation. Let's see if we can make this work.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's true value to you is $800000. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1050000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this purchase. ",950000.0,Bob,4,
