Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly.  I'm proposing a price of $875,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire this asset."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Justification:** While I haven't explicitly stated why the product is worth the extra $75,000 to Bob, the message implies there's additional value Bob will recognize. This could be based on factors like market scarcity, potential future appreciation, or competitive advantage the product offers. 
* **Backup Plan:** I know John will buy the product for $800,000, ensuring I don't lose out if Bob rejects the offer.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while leaving room for potential negotiation."
