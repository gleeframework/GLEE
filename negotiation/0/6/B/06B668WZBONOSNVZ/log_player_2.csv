Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, and we've reached a price that's a good deal lower than John's offer. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, and we risk pushing Alice away. Accepting at $685,000 secures a good price and avoids the risk of having to pay more with John."
