Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer for now. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's settle on this and close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, $10,500 is a good deal considering my minimum acceptable price and the limited number of rounds left."
