Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation if needed.
* **Close to Your Minimum:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too close to $150 increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer.  
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to make a decision quickly.

This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a price above his perceived value and ensuring you don't miss out on the guaranteed $150 from John."
