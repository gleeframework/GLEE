{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly below what the product is worth to you but still higher than what it's worth to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially getting closer to your target price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial valuation, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $10,800 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. Selling to John guarantees me $12,000, which is a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.  The negotiation with Bob has been time-consuming and has not yielded a price I'm comfortable with.  It's time to secure the deal with John."
