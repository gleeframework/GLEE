"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your product, $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $850,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This still allows for a significant profit for you, while ensuring I can get a fair price for my product.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's within my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  Bob is clearly not willing to budge from his price, and I've already made a significant concession.  I'm not confident I can get a better offer from him, and I don't want to risk further rounds of negotiation only to end up with a lower price."
