"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the value I've attached to the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can stretch to $900000. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $750000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering it to you for $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll see the value in it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
