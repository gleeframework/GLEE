{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you know it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is above your minimum:** $1,200,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you get a profit.
* **Leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a good margin for Bob to negotiate, making him more likely to engage in the conversation.
* **Highlights the value to Bob:** Mentioning the product's value to him encourages him to consider a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $1,100,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:

While $1,080,000 is a decent amount, it's still a significant drop from my initial offer and my desired price point. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we try $1,050,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while now, and while I'm willing to compromise, I'm starting to feel like we're hitting a stalemate.  Bob's last offer of $1,050,000 is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm worried that if I keep going back and forth, we'll never reach an agreement.  

I'm going to take John's offer of $800,000. It's not my ideal price, but it's still a decent profit, and it guarantees me a sale."
