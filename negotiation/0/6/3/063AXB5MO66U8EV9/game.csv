"I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. My initial offer is $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate you offering the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to discussing that.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can do $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you being flexible, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we split the difference and I pay $900,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $900,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,100,000? It's a bit more than your last offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
