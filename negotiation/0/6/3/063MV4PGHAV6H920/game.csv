"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at that price?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm afraid $700000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $850000?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go up to $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $750000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $820000, which is a bit above your latest offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",820000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice. However, $820000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $750000, so how about $785000?",785000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about my bottom line. I can do $810000, which is a bit above your latest offer. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",810000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far apart, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $785000, so how about $802500? I'm hoping we can meet in the middle this time.",802500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $802500. I'm willing to make one final concession to $825000. This is as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $825000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
