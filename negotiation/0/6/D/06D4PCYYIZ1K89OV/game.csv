"While I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it aligns with my maximum budget.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm not willing to go down to $1,100,000, but I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
