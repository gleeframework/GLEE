"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your target price of $12,000.**  You have room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control in the negotiation process. 
* **Buying from John is your fallback option.**  If the negotiation fails, you can still secure the product, but at a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $13,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to go down to $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your acceptable range.** You were hoping for $13,000 but $13,500 is still a good deal for you, as it's less than what you'd pay John.
* **There's a chance Alice might not budge further.** You could risk another round of negotiation, but there's no guarantee she'll go lower.
* **Accepting the offer saves you time and effort.** You get the product for a price you're comfortable with without the hassle of further negotiations."
