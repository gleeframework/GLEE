Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is more than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him incentive to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's less than your minimum of $12,000, so you have room to negotiate up.
* **It's a fair starting point:** It allows for both parties to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, this is just an initial offer. You'll have to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response and your own risk tolerance."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than his own perceived value.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's crucial to remember your goal is to maximize your profit. 

Rejecting his offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round. You have the option to sell to John for a much higher price, which gives you leverage during the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer, showing flexibility.
* **It's still above your minimum:**  $9,000 is still more than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **It's clear and concise:**  The message explains why you're willing to compromise and emphasizes the value of the product. 

This counteroffer gives you a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while still protecting your interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $12,000.  This guarantees you your desired profit, and avoids further negotiation with Bob that may lead to a lower price."
