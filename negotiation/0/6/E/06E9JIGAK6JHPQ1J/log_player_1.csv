"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. After careful consideration, I'm pleased to offer it to you for $2,300,000. I believe this price reflects the true value and potential of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This allows room for negotiation and helps gauge Bob's  seriousness.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price, even if it's a general statement about ""value"" can make the offer seem less arbitrary. 
* **Leaving John as a Backup:** While I have the option to go to John at any time, I want to explore maximizing profit with Bob before taking the guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly higher than his perceived value. This indicates room for negotiation. I'm willing to risk one more round to see if I can get closer to $2,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still quite a way from where I see this. How about we meet in the middle at $2,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $200,000 to demonstrate flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate further. 
* **Holding Firm:**  While I'm willing to move, I'm still holding firm above the $2,000,000 mark, aiming to secure a price that represents a significant gain.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to keep Bob engaged and potentially sway his perception upwards."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet at $1,900,000? I think that's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Position:** Bob has steadily increased his offer, indicating serious interest. 
* **Profitable Deal:** $1,900,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,500,000) and a good deal in general.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob walking away or my demands becoming unreasonable. Accepting now secures a very good outcome."
