"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save money, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $8,000. You have a guaranteed option to buy from John at the same price, so it's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by $1,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a better deal and gives room for negotiation. It's a bold move, but it could pay off if Alice is willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than both John's price and my initial counteroffer. There's still room to negotiate. I'll reject and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $7,500.  This shows Alice I'm willing to move a bit closer to her price but still aiming for a lower price. I'm trying to find a middle ground, hoping for a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting increasingly higher, and I'm running out of rounds. It's clear she's not willing to come down significantly. To avoid risking going over my $8,000 budget, I'll buy from John at $8,000. This ensures I get the product while staying within my limit."
