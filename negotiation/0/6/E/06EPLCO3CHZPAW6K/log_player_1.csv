"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product is $10,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
