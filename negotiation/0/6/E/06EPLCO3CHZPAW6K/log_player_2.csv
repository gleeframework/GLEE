"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You have a clear goal of getting the product for as cheap as possible. While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. You can try to get a lower price by rejecting her initial offer and making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $12,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price, considering your own value for the product is $10,000. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at $10,500. Considering its value to me is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial price of $12,000, and her offer of $11,000 is significantly lower than buying from John for $15,000.  While you might be able to negotiate a bit further, accepting this offer is a smart move as it saves you $4,000 compared to buying from John. It's a good balance of getting a decent price while minimizing risk of losing the deal."
