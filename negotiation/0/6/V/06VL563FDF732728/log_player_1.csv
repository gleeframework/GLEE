Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, which is a bit higher than my minimum. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers, but hopefully, he'll see the value in the product and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is still a bit higher than my minimum but shows I'm willing to negotiate. Hopefully, Bob will see that this is a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and try for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is my final offer. It's right at my minimum acceptable price, but I'm hoping that Bob will finally see the value of the product and agree to it."
