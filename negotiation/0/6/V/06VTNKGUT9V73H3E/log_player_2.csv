Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $990,000. I'm willing to make one last push to meet you in the middle. I'm counteroffering at $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this price. What are your thoughts?

```

Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and while it's slightly higher than we hoped, it's the best we're likely to get. Accepting now secures the product below our $1,200,000 maximum and avoids the risk of losing the deal entirely by pushing further."
