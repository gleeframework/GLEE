Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
