"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think you'd really appreciate its value.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 
 
This is a reasonable starting point. It's less than Bob's perceived value, but gives you some room to negotiate if he rejects it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for reaching out, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John,  there's still room to negotiate closer to my desired price.  I'll reject and see if I can push for a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get closer to $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $95?"", ""product_price"": 95} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $92 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd love to get closer to $100, it's getting late in the negotiation and the risk of losing the deal to John is growing.  $92 is a good price, and I'm confident I can still make a decent profit."
