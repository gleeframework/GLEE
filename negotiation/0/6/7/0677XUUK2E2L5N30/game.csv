"Alice, your product is good, but your asking price is a little high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 to make this deal happen.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's get this deal done.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not enough for me. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $850,000 is a fair price that reflects its potential benefit for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal work.",850000.0,Alice,5,
