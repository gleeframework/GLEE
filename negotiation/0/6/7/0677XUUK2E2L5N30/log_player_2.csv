Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you.  Let's get this deal done.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 is still not enough for me. This product is truly valuable, and I believe $850,000 is a fair price that reflects its potential benefit for you. Let's find common ground and make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very slowly lowering her price. At this rate, it's unlikely she'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $800,000. It's time to cut my losses and secure the product from John at a reasonable price."
