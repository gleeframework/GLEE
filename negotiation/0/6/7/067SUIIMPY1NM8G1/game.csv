"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit high for me.  Given the product's value to you at $800,000, I believe a price of $950,000 would be a fair compromise, allowing us both to benefit from this deal. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows both of us to benefit significantly.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference - $1,000,000 feels like a fair price that would allow us both to walk away happy.  This would give you a solid profit while still providing me with a good deal compared to John's offer.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Bob,4,
