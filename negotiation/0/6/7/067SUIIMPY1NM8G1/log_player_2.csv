"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get a lower price from Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $950,000 is closer to a fair deal, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,050,000? This allows both of us to benefit significantly.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is a significant improvement over John's price, Bob can still try to negotiate further. There's still a gap between Alice's perceived value ($800,000) and her current offer. Rejecting and counter-offering again could potentially lead to a more favorable price for Bob."
