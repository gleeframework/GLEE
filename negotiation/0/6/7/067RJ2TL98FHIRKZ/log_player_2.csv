"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be reasonable here. $125 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  This is a great product and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

``` 

While I could try to negotiate further, $135 is a reasonable compromise and a decent savings from both Alice's original offer and John's price. It's unlikely I'll get a much better deal from Alice at this point."
