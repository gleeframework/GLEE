"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $150 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $150, which is above my minimum of $100. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a stronger starting position. 
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to build rapport with Bob. 
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm explicitly stating that I'm open to hearing Bob's thoughts, implying a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is better than selling to John for $100, I'm still confident I can get a better price.  There are 8 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm happy to come down a bit, but $120 is still a little low for me.  How about we split the difference at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and proposing a compromise by meeting him halfway. 
* **Still above my minimum:**  $135 is still significantly higher than my minimum, but it shows flexibility and signals I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Positive tone:**  Keeping the tone friendly and positive helps keep the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down from $150, but $135 is still a bit steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is closer to my desired price than selling to John, I still believe I can squeeze out a little more. We've already established a range between $125 and $135, so I'm confident I can get Bob to go a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. Let's try $130. It's a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Small concession:** I'm offering a small concession from my previous offer, showing flexibility and a willingness to work towards a deal.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Closing the deal:** I'm using a direct question to encourage Bob to accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit more than I'd like to pay. Would you be willing to go back to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

We've reached a point where the negotiation is becoming repetitive. Bob is stuck at $125, and I've already lowered my price to $130.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, accepting his offer at $125 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
