"Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1500000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential return.  What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  This product is worth significantly more than $800000.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This is a fair price, given the value of this product.  What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $950000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the potential of this product.  What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $950000 is still a little low.  I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm confident this is a fair price given the potential of this product. Let's meet in the middle at $1050000.  This is a firm offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $975000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  What do you say?",975000.0,Bob,6,
