Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a truly unique product I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking $1,500,000 for it. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential return.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1500000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1500000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $800000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the potential value.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly below the product's minimum value of $1,000,000. There are 8 rounds left, and I believe I can negotiate a better price. I also have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  This product is worth significantly more than $800,000.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price, given the value of this product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1150000 is still too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to offer $950000.  This is a serious offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price given the potential of this product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum value. While $950,000 is tempting, I still have a few rounds left.  I believe I can get a better price by counteroffering. Additionally, I'm still within reach of John's offer of $1,000,000, which is my backup plan."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a little low.  I'm willing to compromise further, and I'm confident this is a fair price given the potential of this product.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $975000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for the product.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $975,000 is getting close to my minimum value, I'm concerned about the dwindling rounds. We've reached a stalemate, and it's likely Bob won't budge much further.  I have a guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 from John, which is more than my minimum value and provides a more secure outcome.  I'm choosing to sell the product to John to avoid risking a lower price with Bob in the remaining rounds."
