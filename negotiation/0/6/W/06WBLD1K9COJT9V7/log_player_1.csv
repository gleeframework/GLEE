Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  A slightly lower starting point ($1,150,000) leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate up, making him feel more in control of the deal. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. This allows you to confidently aim high with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might reject the offer, leading you to John's lower but guaranteed price. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit with Bob makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
