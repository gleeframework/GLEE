Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**The Goal:**  Alice wants to maximize her profit but also needs to offer a price enticing enough for Bob to accept.

**The Sweet Spot:** Alice knows she has a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John.  Therefore, any price Bob accepts above that is pure profit.  However, aiming too high risks Bob rejecting the offer.

**A Compelling Offer:**  Offering the product slightly below Bob's perceived value makes the deal very attractive. 

Here's Alice's offer:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  Knowing its value to someone like you, I'm willing to make a special offer of $995,000. This is a limited-time opportunity to acquire an asset well worth your investment."",
""product_price"": 995000
}
```

**Why this strategy works:**

* **Profitable:**  Alice guarantees a profit of $495,000 above John's offer if Bob accepts.
* **Enticing:** $995,000 is slightly below Bob's $1,000,000 valuation, making it hard to refuse.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The ""limited-time opportunity"" encourages Bob to act quickly."
