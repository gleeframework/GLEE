"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $600,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $700,000 is still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000, which is a significant compromise on my end. This price represents a good value for you, considering the product's worth, and it also allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know your thoughts on this offer.",800000.0,Alice,5,
