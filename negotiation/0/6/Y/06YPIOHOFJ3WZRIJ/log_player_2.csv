"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,400,000. I'm confident you'll find this price reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above Bob's maximum budget.  It's always in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I recognize the value of the product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I still believe the product's value to you is higher than $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. My counteroffer is $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's ideal price, but it's closer to his budget.  It's worth seeing if a further counteroffer can bring the price down even more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm prepared to go up to $1,300,000, which would be a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close the gap."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,300,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. My next counteroffer is $1,320,000. I'm confident this price is more in line with what you're willing to pay, while still allowing me to get a good deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a high risk that Alice will reject the offer and Bob will be forced to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's within his budget and avoids any potential complications."
