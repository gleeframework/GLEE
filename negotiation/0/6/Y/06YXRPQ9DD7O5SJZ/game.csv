"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to negotiate further. However, $900000 doesn't quite cover my minimum requirements.  How about we split the difference and go with $950000?  This would be a fair compromise, and I'm confident it would still be a great deal for you. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,
