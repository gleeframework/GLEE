"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's close to my ideal outcome but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, creating an incentive for him to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance on the product's worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I see in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $850,000 is better than John's offer, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, as he acknowledged the value of the product. 
* **Building leverage:** Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a fair price considering the significant value this product offers you. Let's meet halfway and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still keeping it significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Reiterate value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, reminding him that this deal is a good investment.
* **Call to action:** I'm pushing Bob to close the deal by suggesting a ""meet halfway"" approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below target:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Room for improvement:** I believe I can still get a higher price by counteroffering and continuing the negotiation. 
* **Building leverage:** Rejecting his offer again strengthens my position and shows him that I'm serious about getting a good price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $875,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product to you. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 890000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession, big impact:**  I'm lowering my price again, but only slightly, showing flexibility while still holding firm.
* **Reiterate value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, making him aware that he's getting a good deal.
* **Closing pressure:** I'm emphasizing the need to close the deal and emphasizing the fairness of my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, but I'm still not comfortable with $890,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $880,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  Bob's offer of $880,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Limited time:**  We're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds, and continuing to reject offers could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **Potential for future business:**  Accepting this offer maintains a positive relationship with Bob, which could lead to future opportunities."
