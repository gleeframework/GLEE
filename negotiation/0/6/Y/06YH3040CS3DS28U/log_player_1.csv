Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $14,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have a strong fallback position.  Offering the product to Bob at a higher price allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with a higher offer ($14,000) gives you room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** Keep in mind that Bob values the product at $10,000. Offering it at a much higher price might make him immediately reject the offer without attempting to negotiate.
* **Market Value:**  While your minimum price is $10,000, understanding the broader market value of the product could inform your pricing strategy. If similar products sell for significantly more than $10,000, you might adjust your offer upwards."
