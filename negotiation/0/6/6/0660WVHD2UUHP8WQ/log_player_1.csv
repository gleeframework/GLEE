Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $18,000. Let me know if you're interested."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you insight into his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Fallback Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 to John, so there's less pressure to accept a low offer from Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your minimum of $12,000 in mind."
