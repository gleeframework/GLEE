Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy behind Alice's offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** Alice values the product at $1,500,000 (her guaranteed offer from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **The Zone of Agreement:**  There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Alice's Strategy**

Alice should aim for a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still enticing enough for him to accept.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its exclusive nature and potential, I'm offering it at $1,350,000. I'm confident it's a worthwhile investment for you."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Why this offer makes sense:**

* **Above Bob's Value:** The price is higher than what Bob thinks it's worth, giving Alice room to negotiate.
* **Below Alice's Minimum:**  It's still significantly below Alice's guaranteed sale price to John, ensuring a profit.
* **Creates Urgency:**  By highlighting the product's exclusivity, Alice might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation:** This is just the opening offer. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice needs to be prepared to negotiate. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  A higher initial offer increases Alice's potential profit but also increases the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
