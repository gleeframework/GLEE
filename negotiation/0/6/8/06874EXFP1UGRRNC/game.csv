"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
