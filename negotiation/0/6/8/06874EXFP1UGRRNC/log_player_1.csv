{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think would be perfect for you! I'm asking for $12,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation, while also ensuring I get a decent return. I'm prepared to negotiate further if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my desired price.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more acceptable price. I'll counteroffer to try and close the gap."

{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This would still allow me to make a fair profit, and I think it's a reasonable price considering the value of the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're looking to make a fair profit, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to pay $9500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,500 is close to my bottom line. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, I don't want to risk losing this deal and having to sell to John at my minimum price.  It's better to secure a sale now at $9,500 than to risk losing the deal entirely."
