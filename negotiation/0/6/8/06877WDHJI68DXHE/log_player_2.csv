"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this incredible product. I know you've been looking for something like this, and it would truly be a valuable asset to you.  To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is far too high.  It's important to bring the price down significantly.  We still have plenty of rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, that starting price is quite high. This product would be valuable to me, but it's not worth quite that much.  How about we bring the price down significantly to something more reasonable?  I'm willing to offer $800,000."",
 ""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Ambitious starting point:** We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still within our acceptable range. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a good deal.
* **Clear communication:** The message is polite but firm, expressing our interest while making it clear that the initial price is unacceptable. 
* **Strategic positioning:**  By starting low, we anchor the negotiation in our favor, potentially influencing Alice to make more significant concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but my initial price reflects the true worth and potential of this product.  Let's find a middle ground - how about we settle on $1,600,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice came down a little, but not nearly enough. Her offer is still significantly higher than our budget. We're making progress, but we need to signal that we're willing to walk away if necessary.  Let's continue negotiating, but with smaller increments to test her flexibility."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for working with me on this. I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. To be frank, I'm considering other options that fit my budget more closely. Would you be willing to consider $1,100,000?  That would make a big difference for me."",
 ""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Upward movement, but controlled:** We're increasing our offer to signal we're serious, but the increase is still below our maximum budget.
* **Mentioning alternatives:** This introduces a subtle pressure point without being overly aggressive.
* **Focus on a win-win:** We're emphasizing our desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Testing the waters:** This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be and whether a deal within our budget is realistic."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position and respect your budget constraints.  However, I need to be fair to the value of what I'm offering.  Let's make this work â€“ how about we split the difference and settle at $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer!  Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price point. However, $1,350,000 is still above our budget. We're willing to pay a bit more than John's price to secure a deal with Alice, but we need to be firm. Let's make one more strong counteroffer before considering John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground here.  $1,350,000 is getting closer, but it's still a stretch for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000.  This is a very strong offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price."",
 ""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final push:** This offer represents a significant increase from our previous offer and is getting close to our maximum limit.
* **Sense of urgency:** We're communicating that this is our best offer and we're eager to finalize the deal.
* **Leaving room for a final concession:**  While this is our final offer, we're leaving a small margin in case Alice wants to meet us halfway in a final counter-offer. 
* **Prepare for John's offer:**  If Alice rejects this offer, we'll likely move forward with purchasing from John."
