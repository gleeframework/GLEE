{""product_price"": 20000}

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

$8,000 is far too low for me. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm counteroffering with $17,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer but is a compromise from my initial asking price.  I want to see if we can find some middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$10,000 is still too low. While I want to close a deal,  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm offering $15,000, which is my absolute minimum. I'm willing to take a loss rather than sell to John at this point, as long as I don't go below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum.  While I'd prefer to sell to Bob, I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum price.  I'll sell to John to guarantee a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
