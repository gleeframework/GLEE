Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer to send:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Reservation Price:**  This is the absolute minimum you'll accept â€“ $1,500,000 (because John guarantees this amount).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price within this range can be mutually beneficial.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for the higher end of the ZOPA, but you need to give Bob an incentive to accept.  Going slightly below your reservation price might seem counterintuitive, but it maximizes your chances of a quick, guaranteed sale.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at a price of $1,490,000. I'm confident this represents a significant value proposition for you."", 
""product_price"": 1490000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" to pique Bob's interest.
* **Value Focus:**  You emphasize the ""unique value and potential,"" subtly implying it might be worth even more to Bob.
* **Strategic Discount:**  The $10,000 discount from your reservation price is small in the context of the overall deal but provides a psychological incentive for Bob to act quickly.

**Important Notes:**

* **Negotiation is Dynamic:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting or moving on to John.
* **Information is Key:** In real negotiations, gathering more information about Bob's needs and constraints can give you an even stronger negotiating position."
