"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum price of $120.** You are aiming to save as much money as possible.
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer.** This gives you more control over the negotiation and the potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the special price, but I'm looking to spend closer to $85. Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $87.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget of $120.**
* **Accepting the offer allows you to acquire the product at a good price.** 
* **While you could potentially continue negotiating, there's no guarantee you'll get a lower price.**  Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and you risk wasting time and potentially losing the deal altogether."
