Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $18,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this offer reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you lower the price later. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning that the offer ""reflects its worth,"" Alice subtly implies the product's value is even higher than the offered price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains friendly and invites Bob's input, suggesting a willingness to discuss the price further.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:**  If Alice knows Bob to be particularly price-sensitive, she might adjust her starting price slightly lower. However, starting too low could undervalue the product.
* **Market Context:** If similar products are commonly priced much lower, Alice might need to be prepared to justify her higher price with unique features or benefits. 

This initial offer aims to maximize profit while leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement."
