"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $14,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my price range. How about $13,000?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,000 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm now offering the product to you for $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
