,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $200 is a bit higher than my budget.  How about $175? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my price range.",175.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $175. How about we meet in the middle at $185? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",185.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $185 is still a bit out of my price range. Would you be willing to go down to $170?  I'm very interested in the product and I think we can come to an agreement.",170.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $170. How about we try $182? It's still a bit above your budget, but I think it's a fair compromise.",182.0,Alice,5,
