Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I recognize the value of this product, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, a fair price considering my budget and the product's worth to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Round 4
