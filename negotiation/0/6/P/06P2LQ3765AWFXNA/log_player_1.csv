Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between the value you place on it and what I am willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is closer to my target, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still too far below my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This leaves you with a considerable profit, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while allowing for a reasonable profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,125,000 is getting closer to what I'm hoping for, it's still a significant drop from my valuation. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price in the next round. There's still a chance to secure a better deal, and I want to explore all options before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,137,500. This represents a good deal for both of us, allowing for a reasonable profit for you and a price closer to my valuation.  I believe we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 1137500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,130,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between respecting the value you place on it and allowing for a reasonable profit margin. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds.  Bob's offer of $1,130,000 is still below my ideal, but it's close enough that I'm willing to accept it.  It's important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, but that's a last resort.  I'm going to take this offer and close the deal with Bob."
