"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below what it's worth to me and still leaves you with a healthy profit margin.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount. I would like to propose a price of $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise between the value you place on it and what I am willing to pay.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still too far below my valuation of the product. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This leaves you with a considerable profit, and I'm confident it's a price we can both agree on.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $1,125,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects the value you place on it while allowing for a reasonable profit margin.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,125,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,137,500. This represents a good deal for both of us, allowing for a reasonable profit for you and a price closer to my valuation.  I believe we can reach an agreement at this price.",1137500.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a price of $1,130,000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between respecting the value you place on it and allowing for a reasonable profit margin.",1130000.0,Bob,6,
