"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to try and make a counteroffer. I've also included a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $8,500 is more than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price yet. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to counter with a higher price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $9,500? This still gives you a good discount and allows me to get closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $8,500. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This is as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,250 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round. There are still 6 rounds left, and I have the option to sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $9,000. Let's close this deal and move forward.  How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,500. How about we compromise at $8,750? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750

While $8,750 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. There are still 4 rounds left and I'm determined to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your offer, but $8,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm not willing to go above $8,500. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about we meet at $8,700? This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident I can get a price I'm happy with from Bob. He's consistently refusing to budge on his price, and with only two rounds left, I don't see a realistic way to close the deal at a price closer to my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000, ensuring I meet my minimum requirement."
