Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 600000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer. This is a fair price considering the potential benefits you'll reap from this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but she's still significantly above your alternative option of buying from John for $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and you risk her sticking to her ""final offer"".  You're better off taking the guaranteed deal with John at this point."
