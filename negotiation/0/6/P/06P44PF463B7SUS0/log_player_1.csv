Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me right now. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I will counteroffer to get a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $900,000. This is still a fair price, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I can't meet that price. How about $700,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and reflects my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

While $700,000 is getting closer, it's still significantly lower than what I'm comfortable with. I need to keep pushing for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $700,000 still doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, but that's my final offer.
