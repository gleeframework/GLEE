Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,500,000) to gauge Bob's interest and potential budget.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price is above my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $1,000,000 provides a fallback and allows me to be more aggressive in my negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer is close to my starting price, but still below what I believe the product is worth. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's room for further negotiation, and I can potentially get closer to my desired price.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  I don't want to settle too quickly, as I might miss out on a better deal later. 
* **John's Offer:**  While I can always sell to John, I prefer to explore the potential for a higher sale price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Bob Halfway:**  I'm meeting Bob halfway by lowering my price to $1,450,000. This shows I'm willing to compromise while still maintaining a profitable sale.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the purchase and see if he's willing to bridge the gap.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  I'm staying above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring that I don't lose out on significant profit.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:**  By making a counteroffer, I keep the negotiation alive and open the possibility of a more favorable outcome for myself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,420,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,420,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer is only $30,000 away from my counteroffer, demonstrating that we are very close to an agreement.
* **Potential Loss:** If I reject Bob's offer and continue the negotiation, there's a chance that he will walk away or become less interested in buying the product.
* **John's Offer:** While selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, accepting Bob's offer ensures a higher profit.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing the negotiation might consume more time, and it's likely that a deal won't be significantly better than Bob's current offer.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer for $1,420,000 seems like the most rational and profitable decision at this stage."
