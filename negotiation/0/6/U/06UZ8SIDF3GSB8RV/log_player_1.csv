"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I believe it's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($15,000) to give myself room to negotiate. 
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the benefits of the deal for both parties. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for a potential back-and-forth. 

This approach aims to maximize my potential earnings while also leaving room for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $17000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $14000 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $15500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still below my desired profit margin. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still negotiate a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer in the next round.
* **Not Selling to John Yet:** John's offer is my safety net, but I'm not ready to sell yet because I still see room for negotiation with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can try to reach a more mutually beneficial price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $14,500 is a bit lower than I hoped for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $15,250? That's closer to your offer and would still make this a worthwhile deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer shows I'm willing to budge from my previous price but still maintain a respectable profit margin. 
* **Reasoning:** I offer a specific reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the mutual benefit and emphasizing the compromise I'm making.
* **Focused on Agreement:** The message aims to encourage Bob to accept the offer by emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial outcome. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $15250 is still a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $15250, which would be $14625. Can we do that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000. There's still room for negotiation.
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:**  John's offer is a backup option, but I'm not ready to sell yet. I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob.
* **Potential for a Final Counteroffer:**  I have a few more rounds to work with, and I'm hoping to convince Bob to come up to at least $15,000 in the next round. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my negotiating position and potentially achieve a more favorable outcome in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I'm still hopeful for a price closer to $15,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's try $14,937.50.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it represents a great value for you."", ""product_price"": 14937.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** This counteroffer demonstrates further compromise and makes it clear that I'm nearing my final offer.
* **Midpoint Approach:**  By offering a midpoint between my previous offer and Bob's, I demonstrate my willingness to reach a fair agreement.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlighting the ""great value"" Bob receives emphasizes the benefit of accepting the offer.

This counteroffer aims to bridge the gap between our desired prices, while also setting the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $14937.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to try to meet you at a price that's closer to $14000. How about $14500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, the potential for further negotiation is dwindling.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** John's offer provides a guaranteed $15,000, which is my minimum value for the product.

Considering the limited time and the risk of further price reductions, selling to John for $15,000 is the most sensible option at this point. It ensures a secure sale at my minimum price without risking further negotiation with Bob."
