"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $110 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to come down a bit.  $110 is still a little more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $105?  That way we both get a good deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $115. It's still a fair price for the product's value and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer.",115.0,Alice,5,
