Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still make it attractive for Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Time Pressure:** Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly.

By offering the product at $145, I am:

1. **Above my minimum:** Ensuring I make a profit if Bob accepts.
2. **Appealing to Bob:** Offering a price that's significantly less than John is willing to pay.
3. **Strategic:** Positioning myself for potential negotiation."
