Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information. If he accepts, great! If he rejects but is willing to negotiate, you can lower the price strategically. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your price based on Bob's reaction and your assessment of his willingness to pay."
