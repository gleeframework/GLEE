# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'm proposing a price of $12,000 for the product. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about budget, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we settle on $11,000? This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $8,000, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm still not willing to go as low as $9,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $10,500? This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $15,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice has shown she's unlikely to budge much further, and getting the product for $8,000 is a much better deal than $10,500."
