"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $9,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for my product. ",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're still working within your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's close this deal now.",8900.0,Alice,5,
