Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $120, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $120 allows room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to compromise.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This price is not too aggressive, allowing for potential counteroffers from Bob.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a backup buyer at $150 provides security and prevents accepting offers that are too low. 

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, we'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth accepting or if we should make a new counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 at this time.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $85 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even lower than the $120 I initially offered.
* **Potential for better offers:**  There's still potential for Bob to increase his offer, especially since he expressed interest in the product. 
* **John's offer is the safety net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 means I can afford to be firm with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit too low for me right now, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm happy to sell it to you for $100. This is still a great price considering its value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm willing to compromise by lowering the price from $120 to $100. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain Profit:** $100 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer of $85 and above my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Positive Framing:** I emphasize the value of the product and the fair price being offered, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and determine if it's worth accepting or if I should make a new counteroffer. 
* John's offer of $150 remains my safety net if I'm unable to reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $100 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'm going to have to look elsewhere.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While $90 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my desired profit margin.
* **Bob's ultimatum:** His ""final offer"" statement suggests he's unlikely to budge further.
* **John's offer is a better alternative:** Selling to John guarantees me $150, which is significantly more than Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

Since Bob's offer is still unacceptable, and John offers a better price, I will choose to sell the product to John."
