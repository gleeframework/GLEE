"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 at this time.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $85 is a bit too low for me right now, I'm willing to come down a bit further. I'm happy to sell it to you for $100. This is still a great price considering its value, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you think?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $100 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This is my final offer, and if you're not able to accept it, I'm going to have to look elsewhere. ",90.0,Bob,4,
