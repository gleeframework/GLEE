"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $12000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'm not willing to settle for less than $10,000 more than my minimum threshold. I'll counteroffer Bob and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $12,000 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $13,500. That's still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $11500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum threshold, I still want to see if I can get a bit more. It's still a better deal than selling to John for $10,000, so I'll counteroffer Bob once more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I want to make this work for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $12,500 for the product. This is my final offer, as it's just above my minimum threshold. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $11000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $11,000 is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum threshold of $10,000 more than my starting price.  With only 4 rounds left, it's unlikely I can convince Bob to go higher.  It's safer to sell to John and secure the guaranteed $10,000."
