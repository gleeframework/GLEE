"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $850,000, which would be $975,000. This is the best I can do at this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. I can do $925,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the lowest price I can accept to sell the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice has come down considerably and is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $925,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer."
