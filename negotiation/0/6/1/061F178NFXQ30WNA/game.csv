"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,800. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $8,200. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know if you're willing to meet me at this price.",8200.0,Alice,5,
