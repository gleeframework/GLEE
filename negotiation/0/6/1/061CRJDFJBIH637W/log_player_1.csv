**Reasoning:** Bob is moving closer to my acceptable price range, but I'm still willing to hold out for a higher amount. There's still room for negotiation, and I'm confident I can get a better offer than $875,000."

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** While I believe the product is worth more, Bob is consistently increasing his offer and is now at a very reasonable $880,000. Accepting now avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me pushing him away in further rounds. It's a strong return and a good deal overall."
