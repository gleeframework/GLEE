"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product which I believe will be a great asset to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down on the price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $9,000?  That gives us both a good outcome.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we meet a little closer to my initial offer? I'm willing to pay $8,500.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your offer, but $8,500 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  It's fair to both of us, and allows for some room for a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting stuck at the same point.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $9,000 is still too high for me. How about $8,600? That's a firm offer.",8600.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your firmness, but $8,600 just doesn't work for me. Let's try to close the deal. I'm willing to come down to $8,800. This is a good price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal.",8800.0,Alice,7,
