Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're not losing money by offering this price.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** There's room for negotiation and potential for a mutually beneficial deal. 
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** You can still increase the price if Bob counters, but you've started the negotiation strong.

Remember, if Bob rejects your offer, you can always counteroffer or switch to John, who is a guaranteed $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is more than your minimum, it's still significantly less than the value to Bob and you can likely get a higher price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, you'll have the opportunity to counteroffer and potentially get closer to your desired price.  You can always fall back to John's offer if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which still gives you a significant discount from its true value.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows you're not willing to settle for his initial price.
* **It's lower than your initial offer:** Demonstrates flexibility and willingness to compromise.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You can still adjust the price based on Bob's response. 

This keeps the negotiation going while still protecting your interests. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer if you need to."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $10000. Can we meet in the middle at $10000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **You're getting close to your desired price:** $10,000 is not a bad outcome, especially considering Bob's initial offer was much lower. 
* **The negotiation is getting drawn out:** Further counteroffers might not result in a significantly higher price, and could risk losing the deal altogether.
* **There's always John:** If you don't accept, you can always sell to John for $8,000, but that's a significant loss compared to the $10,000 offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick sale with a reasonable profit."
