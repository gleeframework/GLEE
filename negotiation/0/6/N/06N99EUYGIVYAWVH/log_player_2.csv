"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product! It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it's worth a significant investment.  My starting price is $1200000. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is within your budget, but you can potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, however, and I'm ready to offer the product for $1000000. This price still provides a fair profit for you and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can finalize this.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still within my budget and allows for a significant saving compared to John's price of $1,500,000.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting my offer and ultimately leading me to have to purchase from John at a higher price is too high.  Accepting Alice's offer secures a good deal within my desired price range."
