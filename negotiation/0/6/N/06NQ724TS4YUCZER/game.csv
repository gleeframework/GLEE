"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $14,500? ",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $14,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  Let's meet in the middle, how about that?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $15,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think this price is fair for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
