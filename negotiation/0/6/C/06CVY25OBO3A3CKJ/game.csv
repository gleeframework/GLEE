"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you consider this offer?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $7,500 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm prepared to sell the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that you're looking to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still not comfortable with the $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $7,750. Can you consider this offer?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating, but $7,750 is still a bit too low. How about $8,250?  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let's try to reach an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $8,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",7900.0,Bob,6,
