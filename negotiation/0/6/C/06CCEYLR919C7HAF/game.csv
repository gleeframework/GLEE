"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? I believe that would be a fair price for both of us.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $135? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
