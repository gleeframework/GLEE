Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I think you're still undervaluing the product. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.

It's time to switch tactics.  Alice has made it clear she's firm on her price of $7,500, and we're only $500 away from John's offer.  There's a risk Alice won't budge, and we'll end up having to take John's offer anyway."
