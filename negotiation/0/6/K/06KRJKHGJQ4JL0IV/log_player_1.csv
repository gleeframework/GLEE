Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it's worth at least $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,900,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since I know the product's value to Bob, starting with a price significantly higher than his perceived value allows room for negotiation while aiming for a maximum profit.
* **Justification for Price:** The message subtly implies the product's value might even exceed $1,500,000 for Bob, justifying the higher asking price. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The presence of John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 gives me leverage. If Bob rejects the initial offer, I'm still securing my minimum desired amount.

This strategy is aggressive, but with the information available, it maximizes the potential for a higher sale price to Bob."
