"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great price for you. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider that?",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,400.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",10400.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $10,300. Can you meet me there?",10300.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, we're getting really close! How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350?  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.  What do you say?",10350.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,350. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there?",10300.0,Bob,8,
