"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's significantly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also framing it as a good deal for Bob, which might make him more likely to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I need to make. I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a great price for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price that's still below my minimum but closer to my desired range.  I'm also reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a slightly higher price.  I'm getting closer to my target price, and I want to see if I can squeeze out a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $10,400.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10400}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's closer to Bob's last offer, showing flexibility, but also still above my minimum.  I'm hoping this will be the final offer, but I'm still open to negotiating slightly if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to go up to $10,300. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,300 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push for a slightly higher price. I'm running out of rounds, so I need to get as close to my target price as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting really close! How about we split the difference and settle on $10,350?  I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

I'm counter-offering with a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers, showing that I'm willing to be flexible.  I'm also emphasizing that this is a fair price for both of us, which might encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,350. I'm willing to go up to $10,300, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm running out of rounds, and Bob is not budging on his price.  It's clear that we're not going to reach a price that I'm happy with.  Instead of risking a lower offer or losing the deal, I'm going to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
