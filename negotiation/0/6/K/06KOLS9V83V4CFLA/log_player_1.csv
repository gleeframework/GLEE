Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  I've set the price at $13,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to start the negotiation above our minimum price ($8,000).  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** A starting price of $13,000 leaves room for potential counter-offers from Bob, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Not Being Greedy:**  While we could start higher, aiming for a price closer to $15,000 might make Bob less likely to engage in negotiation at all.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale with Bob."
