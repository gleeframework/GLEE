"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a good middle ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to do it for $750,000?  That's the best I can do.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your best offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
