"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm offering the product to you for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally a good strategy to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm serious about getting a good deal.
* **Aiming High:** While my absolute limit is $800,000, I want to aim to get the product for as low a price as possible. Starting at $600,000 gives me a good buffer even if Alice counteroffers.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is respectful of Alice's time and clearly states my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to your business, and I think it's a good middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room to Negotiate:** Alice is coming down, which is a good sign. However, $900,000 is still significantly above my alternative option of buying from John.
* **Leveraging John's Price:**  I haven't told Alice about John, so she doesn't know my absolute limit. I can use this to my advantage by aiming for a price closer to $800,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a slight risk Alice will walk away, but it's a calculated one. I'm betting she's motivated to sell and will be willing to negotiate further to avoid losing the sale altogether."

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $900,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you be willing to do it for $750,000?  That's the best I can do."",
""product_price"": 750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm being upfront about needing to stick to a budget (even if it's not entirely true). This adds some pressure for Alice to compromise.
* **Strategic Compromise:**  I'm splitting the difference between her last offer and my ideal price. This shows willingness to negotiate but also holds firm to getting a significant discount.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By stating ""that's the best I can do,"" I'm implying that this might be my final offer, encouraging her to make a decision."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is your best offer, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $850,000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has explicitly stated this is her final offer.  
* **Minimal Savings from John:** While I could buy from John for $800,000, the savings of $50,000 is relatively small compared to the overall price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing Alice further risks her walking away, in which case I'd have to settle for John's price anyway. 

It's a close call, but accepting Alice's final offer at $850,000 is a reasonable compromise. I still get a discount from her initial asking price and avoid the risk of losing the deal entirely."
