Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'll offer it to him at a price that's slightly higher than its value to him, but still reasonable. Let's say I'll offer it to him for $9,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","Bob's offer is $8,500, which is lower than the product's value to me ($10,000). However, it's higher than its value to him ($8,000). Since I want to earn as much money as I can, I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer.

Let's say I'll counteroffer the product to Bob at a price of $9,200. This is slightly higher than his offer, but still lower than its value to me.

Since Bob's offers are getting closer to the product's value to him ($8,000), I'm not sure if I can get a better offer from him. On the other hand, I really want to sell the product for at least $10,000 to John.

Let's say I'll decide to sell the product to John for $10,000. I'll take the sure deal and get the higher price.
