Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to go up to $7,250, but that's as high as I can go. I need to make a profit on this sale.

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is clearly unwilling to budge below $7,200. While you could continue negotiating, it's not worth the risk of her price going up or the time investment when you have a guaranteed offer for $8,000 from John."
