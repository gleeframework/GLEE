"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $200 might be a bit steep, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $160. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling at $80. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $140. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",140.0,Alice,5,
