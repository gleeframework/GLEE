Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $2,300,000 is way above my budget.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $1,700,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find some common ground.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,925,000 is still a bit too much for me, but I'm willing to go up to $1,875,000.  Let's close this deal, we're so close.

It's time to accept Bob's offer.  We're reaching the point of diminishing returns, and risking another rejection for a small potential gain isn't worth potentially losing the deal altogether. $1,875,000 is a strong price, and it's time to close the deal."
