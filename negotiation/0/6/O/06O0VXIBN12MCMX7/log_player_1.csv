Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and provides a solid foundation for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000 sets a lower limit. Offering below this would be foolish.
* **John as Backup:**  The guaranteed sale to John at $1,200,000 provides a strong fallback position, allowing Alice to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and Alice can then potentially settle closer to $1,200,000. 
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing value and fairness, increasing the chance of Bob accepting the initial offer."
