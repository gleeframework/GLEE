{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 149
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible while staying above your minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $149 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring you make a profit if he accepts outright. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $150 to John, so there's no pressure to go below that price. 

By offering the product at $149, you're striking a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and securing a guaranteed profit from John if Bob declines."
