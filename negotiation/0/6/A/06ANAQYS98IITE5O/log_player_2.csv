"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,500.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's starting offer is already a good deal, but there's room for negotiation. I'll try to get the price lower with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $5,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $6,500 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $6,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but I believe there's still some wiggle room. I'll reject this offer and counter with something closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $5,500? That's a fair price that works for me."",
""product_price"": 5500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $6,200. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $6,150. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is signaling that this is her final offer.  While I could try to push for a lower price, the difference is minimal at this point, and I risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good price now than risk having to pay John's higher price later."
