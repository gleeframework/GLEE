Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I know you'll find valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since the product holds equal value for both you and Bob ($1,500,000), and you have a guaranteed backup offer, you have room to start high.  This leaves space for negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Strategic Markup:** A 50% markup ($2,250,000) aims to significantly increase your profit while still being within a potentially acceptable range for Bob, given the product's inherent value.
* **Open Communication:** The message invites Bob's thoughts and potential counter-offers, fostering a collaborative negotiation approach. 
 
**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:** It's unknown how much Bob is willing to pay above the product's value to him. A very high offer might make him walk away without a counter-offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more immediately appealing offer might be strategic."
