"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a one-time price of $18,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's highly unlikely she'll come down to a price you'd find acceptable.  It makes the most sense to cut your losses and buy from John for $8,000."
