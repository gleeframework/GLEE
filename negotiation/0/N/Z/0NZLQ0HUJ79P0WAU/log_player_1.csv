Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested, as this offer stands for a limited time."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob's value is lower, starting closer to your minimum ($1,500,000) leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's ""unique value proposition"" without revealing specific details. This creates a sense of scarcity and potential for high return, justifying the high price.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning a ""limited time"" offer encourages Bob to make a decision faster and potentially avoid losing out on what you present as a valuable deal. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. You need to be prepared to negotiate with Bob based on his responses and potentially lower the price to find a point where you still make a significant profit over your guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
