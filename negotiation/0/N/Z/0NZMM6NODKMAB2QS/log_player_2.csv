"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $14,000 is above his budget, and he can get the product for $12,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down in price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,250? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $13,250 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than the $12,000 he can get from John. He should try to negotiate with Alice again to see if he can get a better price."
