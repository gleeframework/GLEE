Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, but Reasonable:**  Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's below your maximum price but still significantly above Bob's perceived value. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $140, there's a chance Bob might try to negotiate. This leaves you with some wiggle room to potentially go down a bit, but still stay above your minimum.
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, aiming to nudge Bob's perception closer to your own.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiating Style:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might want to start slightly higher. Conversely, if he's known to be agreeable, this offer might be spot on.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Is there a time crunch to sell the product? If so, you might be willing to accept a slightly lower offer from Bob to avoid the risk of going to John."
