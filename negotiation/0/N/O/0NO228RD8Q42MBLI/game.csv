"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1500000 is unfortunately below my minimum for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This reflects the unique value proposition of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the unique value of the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
