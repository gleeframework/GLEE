"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with a high potential for return. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

This is a high starting price, but it gives you room to negotiate.  It's also a good idea to emphasize the value of the product to Bob, even if you don't know the exact value to him. By giving a reason for the price, you make it seem more legitimate and open up a conversation about potential value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2000000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of the negotiation. There are still 9 rounds left, so there's time to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,500,000 is unfortunately below my minimum for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the unique value proposition of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm glad we're finding common ground. Considering the unique value of the product and my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1600000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is only $100,000 below your previous counteroffer, and we're already at round 4.  It's unlikely you'll get a significantly better offer from Bob, and accepting now secures a good profit. Remember, you can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so this is a safe and potentially profitable move."
