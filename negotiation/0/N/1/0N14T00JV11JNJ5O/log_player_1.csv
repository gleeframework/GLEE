Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd find very valuable.  I'm asking $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** Offering $10,000 is a good starting point. It's above my minimum price of $8,000, and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  I want to leave room for Bob to counter without immediately needing to sell to John. This also shows that I'm open to finding a fair price.
* **Friendly tone:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to engage in the conversation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, given my budget constraints, I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for the product. Please let me know if this revised offer is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While I'd prefer more, Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. 
* **No room for improvement:**  If I reject and counteroffer, I risk losing Bob entirely, and then I'm only left with selling to John at the same price.
* **Time is valuable:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and avoids further negotiation."
