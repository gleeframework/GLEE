"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potential range.  I'm also leaving some room for negotiation in case he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is close to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is still a bit higher than my minimum but shows willingness to negotiate. I believe this price might be more appealing to Bob, leading to a quicker deal."
