"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **$10,000 is your maximum limit.**  There's no immediate benefit to accepting Alice's offer, as you can get the product from John for the same price.
* **Negotiation is key.** Rejecting allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting with a significant discount to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. 
* **Testing the Waters:** $7,500 is a substantial price reduction. This will gauge Alice's willingness to compromise. 
* **Room for Maneuver:**  If Alice rejects this, I have room to increase my offer gradually in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Discount:**  Alice's offer of $9,000 represents a 10% discount from my maximum and John's price. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will become more firm, or I might run out of rounds.
* **Secure Purchase:** Accepting at $9,000 guarantees a good deal and secures the product."
