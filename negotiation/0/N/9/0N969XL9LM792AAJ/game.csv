,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer but $20,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $12,000. Would you be willing to come down to that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $20,000 represents the product's true value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm happy to pay $14,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
