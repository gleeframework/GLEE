"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you my product for a very competitive price of $1,200,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Please let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $600,000 is significantly below my desired price, I'm willing to compromise.  I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $900,000. This price reflects the value you've outlined and offers a fair compromise for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $900,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that be feasible?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $700,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to drop my price to $850,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can do.  How about we split the difference at $825,000 and call it a deal?",825000.0,Bob,6,
