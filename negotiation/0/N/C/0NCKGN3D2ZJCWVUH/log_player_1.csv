Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $21,000. I know it's a premium price, but I believe its unique features are worth the investment for someone who will fully utilize them. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 21000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the product's ""unique features"" and their value, I'm aiming to shift Bob's focus from the pure monetary value to its potential benefits.  
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer is a way to gauge Bob's interest. If he outright rejects it, I know I need to significantly lower the price. If he counters, it opens up the negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** Remember, I always have the option to walk away and sell to John for $15,000.  This gives me leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $21,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, given its unique features.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum and what John is offering. I have room to negotiate and will try to meet him somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While I value this product highly, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise, considering its unique features and the value it can bring. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, but above Minimum:** I lowered my price by $4,000, signaling flexibility. However, I remain significantly above both Bob's offer and my $15,000 minimum (John's offer).
* **Reinforcing Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value to justify the higher price point and potentially sway Bob's perception.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves space for further negotiation, potentially reaching a price that's acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, which is a positive sign. However, $12,000 is still below my guaranteed sale price with John. I believe there's a chance to negotiate a better deal with Bob, closer to the $15,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,500?  This is my final offer, as I do have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 14500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm signaling willingness to compromise by moving closer to the midpoint between our last two offers.
* **Finality:**  By stating this is my final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency and encouraging Bob to make a decision.
* **Mentioning Other Buyers (Without Lying):**  Subtly reminding Bob that I have other options keeps the negotiation power balanced.
* **Above Minimum:** This price point still nets me a profit above John's offer, ensuring I get the best possible deal."
