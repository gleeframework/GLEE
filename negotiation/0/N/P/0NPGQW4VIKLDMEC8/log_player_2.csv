While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get her closer to my target price."

Alice is not budging much from her price. I've made a decent attempt to negotiate, but I'm not willing to pay that much for the product.  I'll take the product from John at $1,000,000, which is a much better deal for me."
