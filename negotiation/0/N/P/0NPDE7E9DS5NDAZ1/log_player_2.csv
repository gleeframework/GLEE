"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and Alice is asking for $950,000. 
* **There's room for negotiation.** You have 10 rounds, and Alice is likely willing to come down in price to secure a sale.
* **Buying from John is a last resort.** You can get the product cheaper from Alice, but only if you negotiate effectively."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair:** I'm offering $850,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $950,000. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to be aggressive.
* **Within my budget:** This offer is well within my maximum budget of $1,200,000, leaving me room to potentially increase the offer if necessary.
* **Consider Alice's value:** While Alice wants $800,000, I'm giving her a fair profit margin. 

This counteroffer should put pressure on Alice to consider seriously and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being stubborn:** Alice increased her offer from the previous round, suggesting she is not willing to come down in price easily.
* **Still room for negotiation:** While her offer is higher than my initial counteroffer, it's still significantly lower than my maximum budget.  
* **Avoid rushing into a bad deal:**  I have multiple rounds left to negotiate and shouldn't accept an offer that is too high. 

By rejecting this offer, I can continue to try and lower the price further. Buying from John is still a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  Alice's offer of $975,000 is still higher than my desired price. This counteroffer of $900,000 represents a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still holding firm on my budget.
* **Building momentum:**  By offering a price closer to hers, I'm hoping to create a sense of urgency and encourage her to accept, potentially leading to a quicker deal.
* **Avoiding the extremes:**  This counteroffer avoids going back to my initial $850,000, which she rejected, and avoids accepting her high offer of $975,000. 

This should put pressure on Alice to consider seriously and potentially lead to a quick agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $987,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $987,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:**  She keeps raising her price despite my attempts to negotiate.
* **Still time to negotiate:** We have five rounds left, and I can still try to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still a last resort:**  While her offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, it's not worth rushing into a deal that's not financially beneficial.

I'll continue to try to negotiate a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Persistence:**  Alice is clearly being stubborn, so I need to be persistent in my negotiation. This offer is a slight increase from my previous counteroffer, demonstrating that I am willing to compromise but not cave to her demands.
* **Close to my budget:** While $925,000 is getting closer to my maximum budget, it still leaves me with a $275,000 cushion, which is important in case I need to go higher. 
* **Building pressure:** I'm hoping this counteroffer will make Alice realize that she needs to be more flexible. With only four rounds remaining, the deal is starting to feel like a possibility for both of us.

This counteroffer should push Alice towards making a decision, whether it's accepting my offer or finally lowering her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $993,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $993,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still being unreasonable:** She's continuing to raise her price, demonstrating a lack of willingness to meet halfway.
* **Still time to negotiate:** We have three rounds left, and I'm determined to get a better deal.
* **John is still a fallback:**  While her offer is close to my maximum budget, it's still not a price I'm happy with. 

I'll continue to try to negotiate a lower price in the remaining rounds. If we can't reach an agreement, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  Alice's price is getting dangerously close to my maximum.  This counteroffer represents my final attempt to reach a compromise.
* **Meeting in the middle:** By offering $950,000, I'm essentially splitting the difference between my last offer and her current offer. This demonstrates a willingness to make a concession.
* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds remaining,  I need to push for a deal. I am willing to pay this price, but I will not go higher. 

If Alice rejects this offer, I will buy from John to ensure I get the product. This is a final attempt to get a deal with Alice, acknowledging the urgency of the situation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $998,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $998,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is being unreasonable:** She's continuously increasing her price despite my attempts to negotiate.
* **Time is running out:**  We are in the final round, and there's no guarantee that Alice will accept any further counteroffers. 
* **John is the safer option:**  While I would prefer to save money by negotiating with Alice, her stubbornness has pushed me to the brink. Buying from John ensures I get the product, even if it means paying a higher price. 

It's better to secure the product now than to risk missing out on a deal and potentially losing the opportunity to purchase from John later."
