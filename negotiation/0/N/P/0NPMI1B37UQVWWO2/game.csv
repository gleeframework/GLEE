"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $12,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $7,500. Can we meet somewhere in between?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing your commitment to this deal, and I appreciate that. Let's split the difference - $8,750, and we have a deal.",8750.0,Alice,5,
