Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. Bob should try to negotiate a lower price or buy from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see your point. $9,000 is a fair offer, but it's still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,500.  This would be a good deal for both of us. Let me know what you think.

Bob has reached a point where the price is close to what he's willing to pay, but it's still above his ideal price. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy the product from John for $8,000, as he will save $1,500 compared to accepting Alice's offer."
