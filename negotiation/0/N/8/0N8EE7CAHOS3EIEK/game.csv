"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for my budget.  Would you consider $11,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects its worth to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. However, I must respectfully decline the counteroffer. Our current pricing is based on the value we place on the product and the costs associated with providing it. I would like to propose an alternative at $13,000. I hope this aligns more closely with what you're looking for while still allowing us to fairly compensate for our efforts and resources.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While $13,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $12,000? That would be a fair compromise, I think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
