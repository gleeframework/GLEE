"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. My starting price is $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  That's a bit steep for me right now. Would you consider $100?"",
 ""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125?  That's still a great deal for you and gives me a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $125, and I can get the product for my target price of $120 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation rounds for a potential $5 saving."
