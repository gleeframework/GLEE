Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum price.  I'm going to try to get closer to my ideal price in the next round."

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum price.  I'm hoping to secure a better deal, but I'm not willing to settle for less than $11,000 just yet.  I'm going to make another counteroffer in the next round."
