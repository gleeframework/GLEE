"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,000. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a good price, there's room for negotiation. It's better to see if Alice is willing to lower the price further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  How about $11,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is still a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit, while still being a fair price for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price. While $12,000 is better than $13,000, it's still above Bob's desired price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for a profit, but $12,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,500. It's a good compromise that gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 11500}
