Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Beginning with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($12,000) leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer will help you understand how eager Bob is to purchase the product. His response will dictate your next move.
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that you have John as a backup buyer at $12,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the price John is offering. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Anchoring:** Bob's counteroffer of $12,000 (his perceived value) and mentioning John's offer is a negotiation tactic called anchoring. He's trying to establish a lower price point as the baseline. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While $14,000 is closer to your minimum, there's still potential for a higher price. Bob's willingness to negotiate suggests he sees value in the product.
* **Maintain Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, you signal that you believe the product is worth more. You can then propose a counteroffer closer to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $16,000?"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You're acknowledging Bob's counteroffer by lowering your price, but you're still aiming for a significantly higher amount than his initial suggestion.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still staying closer to your initial asking price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This move will gauge Bob's flexibility.  If he accepts $16,000, you've secured a good deal. If he pushes back, you'll have more information to decide your next move."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which would be $14,000. I'd be willing to go up to $13,500, but no higher. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher price, Bob has now set a firm limit and is unlikely to budge much higher than $13,500.  
* **Profitable Deal:** Accepting $13,500 still gives you a $1,500 profit over your minimum and John's offer.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process. Accepting now means you get your money faster and can move on to other opportunities."
