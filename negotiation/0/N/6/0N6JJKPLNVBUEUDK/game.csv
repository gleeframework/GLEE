"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $18,000 is fair. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000, which is the price John is offering. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $14,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about we settle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, $16,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $16,000, which would be $14,000. I'd be willing to go up to $13,500, but no higher. Would you be willing to consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
