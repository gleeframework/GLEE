"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

You should accept Alice's offer. You're getting the product for $100,000 less than what it's worth to you, and you're saving $100,000 compared to buying from John.  There's no reason to risk further negotiation."
