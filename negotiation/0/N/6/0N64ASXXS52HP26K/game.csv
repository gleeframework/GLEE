"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable for your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts.",850000.0,Alice,1,
