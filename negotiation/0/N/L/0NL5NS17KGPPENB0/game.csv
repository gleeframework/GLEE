"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. Let's make a deal.",14500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $15,500? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's getting closer to what I'm looking for.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,500 is still a little more than I'm prepared to spend, but I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",15250.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, but I'd rather not sell it to you at that price. How about we meet at $15,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal?",15500.0,Alice,7,
