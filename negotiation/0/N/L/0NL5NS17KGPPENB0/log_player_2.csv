```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $18,000 is a bit high for you, but $13,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $16,000?

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to go up to $14,500. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. How about $15,500? It's still a bit higher than your last offer, but it's getting closer to what I'm looking for.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target, it's still slightly above his maximum budget.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  At this point, there's still a chance Alice might come down to a price that's acceptable to both of them.  It's also important to remember that Bob can always opt to buy from John if the negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $15,500 is still a little more than I'm prepared to spend, but I'm willing to go up to $15,250.  This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 15250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,250, but I'd rather not sell it to you at that price. How about we meet at $15,500, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering a price that is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000, even with the added ""extras.""  While the negotiation seems to be progressing, Bob doesn't want to risk further rounds where Alice might retract her offer or insist on a higher price.  He is better off purchasing the product from John at $15,000. It's a known price and avoids further uncertainty with Alice."
