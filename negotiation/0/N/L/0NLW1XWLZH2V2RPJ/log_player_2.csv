"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000. It's in excellent condition and worth every penny. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $15,000.** 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.**  You can potentially get a better deal by rejecting the initial offer and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a counteroffer closer to your desired price.**  I'm offering $12,500, which is still a good profit for Alice, but significantly lower than her initial offer. 
* **Being polite and showing interest.**  This increases the chance of Alice being more open to negotiation. 
* **Keeping it within your budget.**  You're still well within your $15,000 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. It's still a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your desired price point.** While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, you're still looking to save more.
* **There are still many rounds left to negotiate.** You have the opportunity to potentially secure a lower price by continuing to bargain. 
* **You can still get the product from John for $15,000.** This provides you with a safety net if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $13,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to negotiate towards your desired price.**  This offer is still within your budget and closer to the middle ground between your previous offer and Alice's offer. 
* **Using persuasive language.**  Highlighting that this is a fair price for both of you might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Maintaining a friendly tone.**  Staying polite can be helpful in keeping the negotiations positive."
