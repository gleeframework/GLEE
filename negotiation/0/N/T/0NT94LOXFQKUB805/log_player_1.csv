{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a great deal for both of us - it's a fair price for you, and it's closer to my desired value than I expected to get.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $1,000,000 is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  This price allows for a few rounds of counteroffers before reaching my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing Win-Win:**  Framing the offer as a ""great deal for both of us"" can help Bob feel more positive about accepting.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer.
* I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net, ensuring I don't get stuck in a negotiation that won't benefit me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $850,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While it's closer to my desired value than John's offer, it's still not worth it to me.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still potentially get a better deal with Bob. He's shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can push him higher.

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions.  I'll likely offer a price closer to $900,000 to $950,000.
* I'll continue to keep John's offer in mind as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fall apart."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 isn't quite where I need to be, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This represents a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:**  My counteroffer of $925,000 is a significant compromise from my initial offer but still keeps me above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Staying Firm but Fair:**  I've emphasized the value of the product and my willingness to negotiate, suggesting a sense of fairness. 
* **Setting Expectations:**  I've used the phrase ""finalize this deal"" to hint that I'm ready to reach an agreement if possible.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:**  If Bob accepts, the deal is done. 
* **Prepare for Another Round:**  If Bob rejects, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer and be prepared to either accept, make another counteroffer, or sell to John if the negotiation goes too far below my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility.  While I appreciate your coming down in price,  $925,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $875,000.  This is a fair compromise and lets us both get a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $875,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I want to close the deal, I cannot settle for a price that doesn't meet my needs.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Bob is willing to negotiate further. While we are moving closer, I believe there's room for a more favorable outcome for me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000.  This keeps me above my minimum and potentially leads to a quicker agreement.
* **Staying aware of John's offer:** John's offer remains a safety net, and I will consider it if negotiations with Bob become unproductive."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm happy to keep negotiating.  However,  $875,000 is simply too low for me to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers and go with $900,000. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Finality:** Offering $900,000 is a compromise from my previous offer, showing flexibility.  The language also hints at a desire to finalize the deal.
* **Keeping it Above Minimum:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, ensuring I don't lose out on a good deal.
* **Appeal to Common Ground:**  I've framed the offer as a ""good deal for both of us"" to encourage Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.

**Next Steps:**

* **Evaluate Bob's Response:** If Bob accepts, the deal is finalized.
* **Prepare for the Final Round:** If Bob rejects, I'll likely need to make a final counteroffer that is close to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Consider John's Offer:**  If the negotiations with Bob fall apart, I'll consider selling to John for $1,200,000."
