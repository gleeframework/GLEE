Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential $300,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you lose the chance to get more than your minimum.

**Strategy**

Aim high, but be reasonable. You want to maximize your profit, but offering a price too close to $1,500,000 increases the risk of Bob rejecting it.

**Sample Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its significant value and potential, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair. This is a one-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**
    *  It's polite and professional.
    * It hints at the product's value without revealing your hand entirely.
    * It creates a sense of urgency by mentioning other interested parties (even if John is your only other option).
* **Price:**  $1,400,000 leaves Bob with a $100,000 gain, while you secure a $200,000 profit above your minimum. This price point aims for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Important Note:** This is just one approach. You could adjust the price and message based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
