"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer.",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and the value of the product. What do you think?",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,425,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,375,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options.",1375000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 as a final concession. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can close this deal, but if this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Alice,7,
