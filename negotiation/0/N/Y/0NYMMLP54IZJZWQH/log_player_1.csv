"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaving some room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room:**  I'm not asking for the full $1,500,000 that John is willing to pay because I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob.  
* **Building a Relationship:**  The message is friendly and open to discussion, hoping to establish a good rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting this would be a major loss.
* **Potential for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is unacceptable, it's clear he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price.
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds to close the deal, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply not feasible for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,500,000, which is a fair price given the product's value. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm stance:**  I'm setting a firm price that's my minimum. This communicates my seriousness about getting a good deal while leaving room for Bob to negotiate a bit more. 
* **Framing as ""final"":**  This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to seriously consider my offer.
* **Transparency:** I'm being upfront about my reasons for not accepting his previous offer, showing respect for his situation while staying firm on my own needs."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,500,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,350,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product, and I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 6 rounds remaining. I can afford to reject his offer and see if he's willing to go higher. 
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,500,000 gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through. 

I'll counteroffer with a slightly lower price to see if I can meet Bob in the middle, but I'll remain firm on my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation. While $1,350,000 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,425,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges both our needs and the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's exactly halfway between Bob's last offer ($1,350,000) and my previous offer ($1,500,000). This shows a genuine willingness to compromise.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the mutual benefits of the agreement, emphasizing that it acknowledges both our needs.
* **Open ended:** I'm asking Bob for his thoughts, keeping the communication open and inviting him to make a counteroffer if needed. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while remaining firm on my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,425,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to offer $1,375,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. If this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Time pressure:** While Bob mentions exploring other options, I still have 4 rounds left, so I can afford to reject this offer.
* **John is a reliable alternative:** I know John is willing to pay my full asking price. This gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall through.

I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired amount, but I will remain firm on my minimum price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,375,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000 as a final concession. This offer reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'm confident we can close this deal, but if this offer isn't acceptable, I may have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer. This creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to accept.
* **Small Adjustment:** I'm only decreasing my price by $25,000 from my previous offer. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway but not budge too much further.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefits:** I'm highlighting the benefits for both of us. This helps frame the offer positively and encourages Bob to see the value in reaching an agreement.
* **Time Pressure:** While I still have rounds left, I'm gently introducing the possibility of exploring other options if Bob doesn't accept. This adds a bit of pressure without being overly aggressive."
