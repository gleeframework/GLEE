Round 2

# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,700. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 8700}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $8,700 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm not convinced I'll be able to get more. It's best to sell to John now and ensure a guaranteed profit."
