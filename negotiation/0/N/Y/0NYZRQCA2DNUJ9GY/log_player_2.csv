"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $15000 to us, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to start our negotiation at $12000. Let me know if this is within your budget or if you'd like to propose a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a good starting point, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your starting point, $12,000 is a bit higher than my target price. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. Considering the value of the product and our costs, we're not able to match $10000. We're willing to negotiate further, so how about we meet in the middle at $11000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. While $11,000 is still higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's a good compromise and  a significant saving compared to buying from John.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves $4,000."
