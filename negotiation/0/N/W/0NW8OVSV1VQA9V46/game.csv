"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,450,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is too far from what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $1,200,000? This would allow me to proceed with the purchase and I believe reflects the value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
