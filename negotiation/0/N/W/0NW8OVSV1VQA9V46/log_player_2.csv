"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,450,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,450,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget, and he can get the same product for less from John.  It's best to start negotiating with Alice to see if she's willing to come down in price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,100,000 is too far from what I can accept. How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's true worth and potential. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

While $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. It's best to reject Alice's offer and try to get a lower price.  Bob can still get the same product from John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."

This would allow me to proceed with the purchase and I believe reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
