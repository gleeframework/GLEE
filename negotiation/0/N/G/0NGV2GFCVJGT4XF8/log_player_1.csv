"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. Rejecting his offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will still benefit both of us.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1075000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,075,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm still aiming for a higher price. While $1,050,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can secure a slightly better deal by continuing negotiations. There are still 6 rounds remaining, and I'm not yet desperate enough to accept Bob's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,060,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,030,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only 4 rounds left, the negotiations with Bob have stalled. His offer of $1,030,000 is only slightly better than John's offer of $1,000,000. To avoid the risk of further negotiation breakdowns and the potential for a lower price, it's more strategic to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000. This ensures a quick and profitable transaction, minimizing the risk of further negotiation complications."
