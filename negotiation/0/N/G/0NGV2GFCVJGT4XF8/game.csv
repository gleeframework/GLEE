"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it doesn't fully reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This represents a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that will still benefit both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
