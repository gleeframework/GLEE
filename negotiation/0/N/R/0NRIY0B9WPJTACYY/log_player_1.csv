Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Strategic Markup:** The $1,450,000 price represents a significant markup from your minimum acceptable price, aiming to maximize your potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys the product's value while leaving the door open for Bob's response and potential negotiation.

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject this initial offer. However, with a guaranteed buyer already lined up, you have the leverage to start high and potentially secure a much higher profit."
