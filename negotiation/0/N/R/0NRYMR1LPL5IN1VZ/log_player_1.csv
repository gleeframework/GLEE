"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $1,750,000 leaves enough space for Bob to make a counteroffer without me needing to go below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I have John as a backup buyer, which gives me leverage if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Counteroffer is a better option:**  I'm willing to negotiate further and have already demonstrated a willingness to compromise (by starting with a lower offer than my minimum). A counteroffer is a good strategy to see if Bob is truly willing to meet me somewhere in the middle.
* **John is a good safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob continue to fail, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's position but making it clear that his offer is unacceptable.
* **Counter with a Compromise:**  $1,600,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. It's still above my minimum and allows for further negotiation.
* **Maintain Value Proposition:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product for Bob, reminding him that it's a great deal even at $1,600,000. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to keep the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1600000, which would be $1400000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, he's not quite there yet.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I want to try to push Bob closer to my desired price.  A counteroffer gives me another chance to negotiate.
* **John remains a strong option:**  If negotiations continue to fail, selling to John for $1,500,000 is a solid backup plan."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000.  I'm still a bit away from my target, but I want to make this work.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This price reflects the value of the product for you, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show compromise:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's efforts while emphasizing my own willingness to negotiate.
* **Close to my minimum:** $1,550,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, leaving very little room for further compromise.
* **Highlight value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is still a great deal for him at this price.
* **Encourage agreement:** I'm expressing a desire to reach an agreement and hoping to close the deal in this round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1550000. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1400000. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as it's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Deadlock:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to go above $1,400,000, and I'm unwilling to go below $1,500,000. 
* **John is the safer option:**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids any further risk of losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only a few rounds left, it's unlikely that Bob will change his mind.  It's better to take the guaranteed deal with John."
