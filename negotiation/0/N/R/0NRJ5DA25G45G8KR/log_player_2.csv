"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$75 is a good price, but you can likely do better.  You're aiming for the lowest possible price, and you have 10 rounds to try.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to potentially get an even better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This shows my intent to negotiate aggressively, but it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground between our two positions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly from her initial offer.  While $70 is still more than my ideal price, it's getting closer.  Given that I have limited rounds and I don't know Alice's minimum price, accepting this offer is the most rational choice. It saves me money compared to buying from John and gives me a decent product at a reasonable price."
