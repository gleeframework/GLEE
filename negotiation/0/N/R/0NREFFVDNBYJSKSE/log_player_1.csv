Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm really struggling to go above $8,750. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,000? I'm willing to make a final push to get the deal done, but I really need to stay within my budget 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's a good compromise and  closer to my desired price point.  It's also worth noting that we are getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob altogether."
