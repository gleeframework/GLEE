Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,500,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,500,000 is still a stretch for me.  Could we settle on $1,000,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has stated this is his final offer. While he might be bluffing, it's getting increasingly risky. Accepting his offer would mean a $100,000 loss compared to John's standing offer.  It's not worth the gamble of continuing negotiations with Bob.  Selling to John guarantees the minimum acceptable price."
