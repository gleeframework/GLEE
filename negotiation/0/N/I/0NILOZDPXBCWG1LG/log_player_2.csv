(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is asking for $175. This is a significant markup.
* **Counteroffer is a better option:**  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option:**  You can always buy from John for $100, so you have a safety net in case the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting point:**  I'm starting at my maximum price, $100. This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but won't go higher.
* **Direct approach:**  A firm counteroffer forces Alice to consider my position and signals that I'm willing to walk away if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $135 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum price of $100.
* **Counteroffer is still the best option:** Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **Buying from John is always a fallback:** I can still buy from John for $100, so I'm not in a rush to accept anything above that."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Increase my offer slightly:**  I'm increasing my offer from $100 to $110, showing willingness to compromise. 
* **Staying within my budget:**  $110 is still within my price range, but it's a significant increase from my initial offer.
* **Testing the waters:** I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway or if she'll make a counteroffer closer to her previous price."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  $125 is closer to my price range, but it's still above my maximum of $100.
* **Negotiation is still worthwhile:**  There's still potential to negotiate a better price. Rejecting the offer keeps the conversation going.
* **John is still my backup:** I have the option to buy from John for $100, so I don't need to settle for anything above that."

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This offer is a compromise, splitting the difference between my previous offer of $110 and Alice's latest offer of $125. 
* **Showing flexibility:** I'm showing Alice that I'm willing to negotiate and move towards a middle ground.
* **Still within my budget:**  $115 is within my price range, but it's a significant increase from my initial offer.
* **Final push before considering John:** I'm hoping to get a deal before I have to consider buying from John, but I'm prepared to walk away if necessary."
