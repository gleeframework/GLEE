"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value it brings.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000.  This price is fair, reflects the value we both see in the product, and gives us both room to close a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
