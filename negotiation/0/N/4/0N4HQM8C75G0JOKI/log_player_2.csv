"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
Alice's offer is too high.  There's room to negotiate down towards a price closer to Alice's value of $12,000. It's worth seeing if you can get a better deal before resorting to John's $15,000 offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $13,000. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than the initial offer, it's still above Alice's value of $12,000. There's still room for negotiation.  Bob should push for a slightly lower price before considering John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close to a deal, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,500. I'll meet you at $13,200, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice is clearly holding firm near her bottom line. While it's not the ideal price, $13,200 is still a significant savings compared to John's $15,000. It's time to accept and secure the product."
