It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer.  $125 is a little low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

I'll keep negotiating with Alice.  $135 is still a bit high, but I'm hoping to get it closer to my target of $125."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $135. How about we split the difference at $130?  That seems fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
