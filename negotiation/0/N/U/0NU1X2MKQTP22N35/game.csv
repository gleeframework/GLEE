"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just getting started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $13,500. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiations to find a mutually beneficial price.",13500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $11,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,750. This is a fair price considering the product's value and the effort that went into creating it. What do you think?",12750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $12,750 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a little high for my budget. Could you do $11,500?  I think that's a fair offer.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still a bit hesitant, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down another $250, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. I'm offering $12,000. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to sell the product to you.",12000.0,Alice,5,
