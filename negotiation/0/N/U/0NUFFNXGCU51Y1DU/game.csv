"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $900000 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1200000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is the best price I can offer at this stage, but I'm willing to negotiate further if you're willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is getting closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm prepared to offer $1300000. This represents a significant commitment on my part, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to make a significant commitment, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1200000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
