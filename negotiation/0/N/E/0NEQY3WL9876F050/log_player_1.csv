I'm offering the product to Bob for $12,000. This is a starting point for negotiation, and I'm confident that the product is worth this amount to him. I'm also willing to negotiate further if he makes a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. Although $10,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer and try to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm willing to lower my price to $11,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob will find it acceptable."
