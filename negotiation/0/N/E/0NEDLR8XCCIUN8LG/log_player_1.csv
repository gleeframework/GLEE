"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it, which is still a good deal for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is a significant gap from my initial asking price. This product has considerable value beyond what you're currently offering.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this is a fair compromise, reflecting the true value of what's being offered."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. This represents a significant increase from my initial offer and is a fair price considering my budget. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

We're still significantly under the product's value to me.  I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a major loss."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  To be frank, $950,000 is cutting it very close to my minimum. I'm willing to accept $1,000,000 for the product, but this is my final offer. This provides a significant return for you while acknowledging the inherent value of what I'm offering."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,000,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $975,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and represents a fair compromise.  This is my final offer, let's finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $975,000 offer.  While it's tempting to try and squeeze out a bit more, the difference isn't worth risking the sure $1,200,000 from John."
