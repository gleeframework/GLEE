"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800000, and I'm willing to compromise to make a deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm ready to pay $800000 for the product. It's the maximum I can afford, and I believe it's still a good value for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, Bob, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the value you place on the product and my minimum selling price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1100000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $900000 for the product.  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to make a decent deal. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $900000 is your top limit, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $1100000 for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1050000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
