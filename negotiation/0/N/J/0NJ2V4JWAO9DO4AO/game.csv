"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget allows me to pay no more than $800,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I'm trying to find a solution that works for both of us.  While I can't accept $800,000, I'm willing to come down slightly further.  How about we settle at $875,000? This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your continued efforts to reach an agreement. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and while I appreciate the reduction, I still believe that $800,000 represents a fair price for the product. I hope you can accept this as my final counteroffer.",800000.0,Bob,6,
