Round 2
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been steadfast at his $800,000 offer and has even called it his final counteroffer.  It's very unlikely he'll move significantly from this price.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $800,000, it makes the most sense to cut my losses in terms of negotiation time and secure the sure thing. Continuing with Bob carries the risk of him not budging and me potentially losing out on John's offer as well."
