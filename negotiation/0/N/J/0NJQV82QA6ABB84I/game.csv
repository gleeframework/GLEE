"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this offer?",14000.0,Bob,4,
