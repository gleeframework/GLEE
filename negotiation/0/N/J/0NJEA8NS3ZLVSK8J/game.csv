"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not sure I can go as low as $90. I can do $115, which is a significant discount from the original price, but still reflects the value of the product.",115.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go as high as $105. I can do $110, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I've put into it.",110.0,Alice,5,
