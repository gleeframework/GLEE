Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum price point. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
