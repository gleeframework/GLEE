"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value may differ. I'm willing to sell it to you for $95. I believe this price reflects the quality and benefits of the product while allowing us both to be satisfied with the transaction.",95.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $95 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, as it's above your minimum price point. Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
