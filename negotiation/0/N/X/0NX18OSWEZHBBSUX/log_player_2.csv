You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can do better than $100. Let's try to negotiate with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75} 
```

I'm starting with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to negotiate.  $75 is a significant discount from her initial offer, and hopefully, it will encourage her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still a bit high, but we are getting closer. I'll counter again and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

I'm raising my offer slightly, showing Alice I'm serious about buying. $80 is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful Alice will accept."
