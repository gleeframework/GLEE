Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, that price is a little too high for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, however,  $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,200,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm seeing a gap between our valuations.  I'm willing to move up slightly, how about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above our minimum and have room to negotiate. I believe we can get a better outcome by countering again."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close. Let's split the difference and call it $1,100,000?  This seems like a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed to purchasing and has steadily increased his offer. While we could push for a slightly higher amount, $1,100,000 is a strong profit margin, and continuing the negotiation has diminishing returns and carries the risk of losing the deal entirely."
