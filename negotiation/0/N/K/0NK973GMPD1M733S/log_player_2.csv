"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process.  By offering $900,000, you are showing Alice you are serious about buying the product but are also trying to secure a better price for yourself.  This leaves room for further negotiation while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $920,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's still a good price for you, saving you $80,000 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject again, and you might end up paying more or having to buy from John.  Accepting her offer is the best option at this point."
