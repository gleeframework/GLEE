"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $180.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $180 is way above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $60 for this product.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $180 was a bit steep, but $60 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $120. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer, but $120 is still outside of my price range. Could you do $75? That's the highest I can go.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stretch your budget, but $75 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $110. This is the final price I'm willing to consider.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but to be totally honest, $80 is the absolute maximum I can spend. I understand if that doesn't work for you, but I'm hoping we can make this deal happen.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty, and I understand that $80 is your absolute limit. However, I still need to make a profit, and $80 is below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at the halfway point between $80 and my minimum price of $150, which is $125. This is my final offer.",125.0,Alice,7,
