"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $9,000 is still too high for Bob, given the product is only worth $8,000 to Alice. There's room to negotiate.  It's worth seeing if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  However, $9,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 7500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above Alice's minimum value. This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while also pushing for a favorable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $7500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's ideal price. While $8,200 is still a bit higher than Bob's initial counteroffer, it's significantly lower than Alice's first offer and closer to the product's worth to Alice.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal and potentially having to buy from John at a much higher price. It's a good time for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a reasonable price."
