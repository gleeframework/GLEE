"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair deal that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. This would still be a fair deal for you, as it's well above my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for you and the original price I had in mind.

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,350,000 is closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $1,325,000? This is a fair compromise and would allow both of us to get a good deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get closer to my original target price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,340,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",1340000.0,Alice,5,
