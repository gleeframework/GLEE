"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer in its field. I'm open to negotiations, but I need to start with a fair price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18000 is above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go as high as $12000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $12000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $14000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to think about the value this product brings to the table. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $15500. What do you think?",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $15500 is still above my limit.  How about we split the difference?  I'll go up to $14750. This would allow both of us to make a reasonable deal.",14750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $14750 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14750 and $15500, which would be $15125. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value this product brings. What do you think?",15125.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $15125 is simply too much for me. I'm prepared to go up to $14900.  I believe this represents a fair compromise and a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14900.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $14900, but I need to make a bit more on this sale. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14950. This is a small increase, but I believe it's justified given the value this product brings. What do you think?",14950.0,Alice,9,
