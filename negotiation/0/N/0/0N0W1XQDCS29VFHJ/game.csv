"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me, I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This feels like a fair offer considering the product's potential.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,200,000.  This product is worth every penny of that to you, and likely even more in the long run. I'm willing to let this be my final offer. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
