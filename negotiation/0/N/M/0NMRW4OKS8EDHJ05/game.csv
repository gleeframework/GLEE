"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my offer of $14,000.  It's a fair price, and I'm ready to finalize the purchase if you're willing to accept.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $14,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $15,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
