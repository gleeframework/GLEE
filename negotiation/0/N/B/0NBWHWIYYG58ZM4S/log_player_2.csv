"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $130. It's a great deal for something you'll get a lot of use out of! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is still quite a bit higher than your maximum price and significantly higher than John's backup offer. You're better off seeing if she'll come down further."
