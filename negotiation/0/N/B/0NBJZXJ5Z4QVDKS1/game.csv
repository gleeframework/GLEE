"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer, but that price is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's worth.  Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the product has value, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  I can go up to $1,250,000.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing a gap in our valuations. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but not to $1,250,000. Would you consider $1,700,000?",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but I need the price to be lower.  How about $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,400,000 is closer to where I'd need to be, it's still a bit too low. My final offer is $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings.",1550000.0,Alice,7,
