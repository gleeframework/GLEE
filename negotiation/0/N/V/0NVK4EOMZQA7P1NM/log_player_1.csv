Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($150). This gives me some room to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my target.  I'll be prepared to counter Bob's offer if it's too low, but also willing to accept a price closer to $150 if it seems like that's the best deal I can get."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low for me. While it's better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still staying above my minimum acceptable price of $150. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while also showing Bob that I'm not willing to settle for an unfairly low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that he isn't willing to meet my minimum acceptable price. It's better to sell to John for $150 and guarantee a reasonable profit than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting nothing."
