"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I also want to emphasize the value of the product to make him more interested in buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $110 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable value of $120.  I'll reject and counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think this is a fair price that benefits us both."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, Alice.  How about $75? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$75 is still too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120, and I have another buyer who is willing to pay that amount. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
