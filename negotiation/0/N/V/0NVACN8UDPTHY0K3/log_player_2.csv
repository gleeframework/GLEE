"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. $65 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I think this is a fair price that benefits us both.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $75 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While it's still a bit more than John's offer, getting the price down to $85 is a decent deal. It's uncertain if Alice will go any lower and risking going over budget isn't worthwhile."
