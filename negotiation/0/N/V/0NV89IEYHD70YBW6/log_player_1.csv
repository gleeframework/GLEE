"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is an aggressive opening, but I believe it's justified given my minimum value of $8,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. I have 8 rounds remaining and can always go with John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise. I believe this price is still fair, considering my minimum value and Bob's low offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob in the coming rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting increasingly aggressive with his offers. While $6,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to continue negotiating. I still have several rounds left and I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues my product. I can always sell to John for $8,000 if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to offer $8,500. This is a significant concession, but I'm trying to bridge the gap with Bob. I'm getting closer to my minimum value, and I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable offer.  If he continues to lowball me, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob finally offered my minimum value. I'm happy to accept his offer and finalize the deal. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal."
