"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product at a special price of $12,000. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. This is a compromise that still benefits both of us, and I think you'll find it's a fair price for the product.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10,500 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a good deal for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to accept $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,000, which is still a great price for a product worth $8,000 to you. I think it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",10000.0,Alice,5,
