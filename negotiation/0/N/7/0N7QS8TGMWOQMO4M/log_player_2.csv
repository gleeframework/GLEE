"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you, which is valued at $10,000 to you. Considering its exceptional quality and the benefits it offers, I am offering you the opportunity to acquire this product at an exclusive price of $9,500. This is a special offer tailored to recognize your interest and commitment. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is overpriced. You know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. While her message tries to inflate the product's value to you, you should aim for a price closer to Alice's perceived value ($8,000). By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding with John's offer as a backup."
