"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $120 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference again and settle on $140? That sounds fair to me.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a fair price, but $140 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again and offer it to you for $155. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, I'm finding it hard to justify going above $145.  Would you be willing to meet me there?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $155 and $145, which would be $150. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",150.0,Alice,7,
