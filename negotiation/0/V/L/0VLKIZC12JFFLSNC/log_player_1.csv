Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Setting the price at $11,999 makes it seem like a ""deal"" compared to John's offer, potentially enticing Bob.  The slight discount from $12,000 creates a sense of urgency.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially leading to a higher final sale price than $12,000."
