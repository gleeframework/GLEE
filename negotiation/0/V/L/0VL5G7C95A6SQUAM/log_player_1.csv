Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe is a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price of $100, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Establishing a baseline:** This price helps set a starting point for the negotiation and gives Bob a chance to consider if he's willing to pay this amount.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message is friendly and open to negotiation, signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative buyer:** While I'm open to negotiating with Bob, I'm also aware that I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120, which serves as a safety net and gives me negotiating power."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still higher than his perceived value:**  Even at $90, Bob is still paying more than what he believes the product is worth ($80). 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I can potentially negotiate a price closer to my minimum of $120 by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.
* **John as a safety net:**  Knowing I have a guaranteed sale to John at $120 gives me the confidence to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're trying to stay within a budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? This would still allow me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($100) and Bob's offer ($90). This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and find a solution that benefits both parties.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is still reasonable while offering a good deal. This subtly reminds Bob of the potential value of the product.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not giving away too much. $95 is still above Bob's perceived value and provides me with a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget constraints, could you possibly lower the price to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  I set a minimum price of $120 for myself, and Bob is now offering $90, which is significantly below that.
* **No room for further negotiation:**  Bob is unwilling to budge, and I've already made a counteroffer. Further negotiation is unlikely to result in a price that meets my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $120, which is the best possible outcome given the current situation. 

It's better to secure a guaranteed profit with John than risk further negotiation with Bob and potentially end up with a lower price or a failed sale."
