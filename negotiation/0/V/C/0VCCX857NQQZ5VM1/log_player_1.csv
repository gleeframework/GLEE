Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting with a higher price than Bob's perceived value allows room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to accept quickly.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the initial offer is high, it leaves space to negotiate down towards $15,000 (your guaranteed sale price with John) if Bob counters.

**Important:** This strategy aims to get the highest possible price from Bob.  However, be prepared to negotiate if he rejects the initial offer. You can always lower the price closer to $15,000 to ensure you don't lose the sale entirely."
