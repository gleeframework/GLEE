Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $130, but I'd like to get a bit more for it. How about we try $145? It's a small increase, but it's worth it to me.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I'm glad we're getting close. I can see you're willing to pay $135, and I'm willing to meet you there. Let's try $142, and see if we can finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is clearly unwilling to go below $140, and is very slowly decreasing her offer price. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that beats John's offer of $150 in the remaining rounds.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
