"Hi Alice, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm sure you'll still find this a great deal for the value you'll get out of the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $90 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's meet in the middle at $87.50.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate. How about we meet at $89?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the deal.",89.0,Alice,5,
