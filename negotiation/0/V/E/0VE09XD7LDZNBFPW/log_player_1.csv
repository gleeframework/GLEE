Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so this is your ""walk-away"" point.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a deal is impossible unless Bob is willing to pay more than he values the product (unlikely) or you accept less than your guaranteed amount.

**The Offer**

Since a mutually beneficial deal seems impossible, you have two options:

**Option 1: Aim High, Hope for the Best**

While unlikely, Bob might be willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth due to unforeseen circumstances or emotional factors.  You could try a high price, leaving room for negotiation but knowing John is your backup.

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm asking for $1,450,000. I'm open to discussing this further if you have any questions."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Option 2:  Go Straight to John**

Knowing a deal with Bob is improbable, you could bypass the negotiation and sell directly to John. This guarantees your minimum price.

**Which option is best?**

Option 2 (selling directly to John) is the most logical choice. It guarantees your minimum acceptable price without the risk of Bob rejecting your offer."
