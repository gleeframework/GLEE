"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's lower than Bob's value, making it likely he'll accept, but still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price, allowing me to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $130 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial target of $140. There are still rounds to negotiate, so I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm going to counter with $135. This is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.  I'm hoping to meet in the middle and secure a deal that's mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's significantly higher than selling to John and we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  There's a risk of further negotiation, but I don't want to lose out on a good deal."
