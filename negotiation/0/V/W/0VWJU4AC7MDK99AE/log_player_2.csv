"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that I know you value highly. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. This is a great deal for both of us - you get a product worth $120 to you for a lower price, and I get to sell it to someone who appreciates it. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Your Value:** You value the product at $120.
* **Alice's Offer:** Alice is offering the product for $100.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the same product for $120.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John. Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, there's no guarantee you'll be successful. It's a safer bet to accept her offer and secure the product at a lower price."
