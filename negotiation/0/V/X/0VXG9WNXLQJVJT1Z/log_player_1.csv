"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is a good starting point. It's more than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly approach:**  I'm using a friendly tone and highlighting the product's value to Bob. 
* **Room for compromise:** By starting at $100, I can comfortably negotiate down if Bob counters. 
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and see how he responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm only willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While I'm willing to negotiate, $85 is below my minimum price of $80. Accepting it would mean taking a loss.
* **Potential for better deal:**  Rejecting allows me to counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price point.
* **Selling to John is not ideal:** While John offers a guaranteed $80, I'm hoping to get more from Bob.  I'm not yet ready to give up on this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $85 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $95? This would still be a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to him to justify my counteroffer.
* **Staying firm:** $95 is still above my minimum, but it shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Setting the stage for a possible agreement:**  This counteroffer puts the ball back in Bob's court and sets the stage for a potential agreement in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $95 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $90?  This is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my goal:** $90 is very close to my desired price point.  
* **Fair compromise:**  Bob's offer represents a fair compromise, as it's halfway between my last offer of $95 and his offer of $85.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might have to settle for John's offer of $80. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a good deal for me while minimizing the risk of losing the sale."
