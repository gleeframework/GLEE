"That's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $70 for it. What do you think?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I still think the product is worth more than $70. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'll offer it to you for $100.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $100 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm sticking with my offer of $70. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider other options.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're really interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $70. I can meet you at $90, but that's the lowest I can go.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really trying to make this work, but $90 is still too much. I'm willing to pay $80, which is the absolute maximum I can do.  It's a fair price for both of us. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to move on.",80.0,Bob,6,
