``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit lower than what the product is worth to me, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good chance of getting a price closer to what I want.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging, which might help Bob feel more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $7,500 is too low for me, and I think I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, because I believe I can still get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $8,500. Let's meet in the middle and make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $8,250. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still lower than what I initially hoped for, it's a good compromise.  I'm happy with $8,250, especially since it's much closer to my minimum threshold of $10,000 than John's offer.  It's a good deal for both of us."
