Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $9,000 just yet. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging significantly on price. Her offer of $13,500 is still considerably higher than your maximum budget of $10,000, and she seems intent on staying closer to her $12,000 valuation. At this point, it's more beneficial to cut your losses and buy from John for $10,000, ensuring you stay within your budget."
