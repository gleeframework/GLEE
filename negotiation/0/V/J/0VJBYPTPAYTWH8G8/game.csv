"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $15,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  This product is only worth $10,000 to me, max. I could consider something closer to $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12,000, which is still a great deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to increase my offer to $9,000.  That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $9,000 just yet. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. It's a bit higher than my previous offer, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
