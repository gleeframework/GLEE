"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
