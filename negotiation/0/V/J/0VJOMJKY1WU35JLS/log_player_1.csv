Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value, but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Space:** This gives Bob the opportunity to counteroffer, allowing for a potential meeting point where I can still earn a substantial amount.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer and will use it as a benchmark for when I need to stop negotiating. If Bob's counteroffers get too low, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price with a counteroffer. 
* **Avoiding John:** Selling to John right now would be a guaranteed $1,500,000, but I'm hoping to get closer to that amount with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me.  Considering the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This still gives you a great deal, and it's closer to where I need to be. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Compromise:** I've reduced my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Maintaining Value:** This price is still significantly higher than Bob's offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if he's willing to bridge the gap."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet your asking price of $1,100,000. I am willing to pay up to $1,050,000 for your product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Approaching Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still significantly lower than my desired earnings.
* **Risk of Stalemate:** Further negotiations could potentially lead to a stalemate, where neither of us are willing to budge. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed profit that meets my minimum requirement. It's safer and more lucrative to accept John's offer and avoid the risk of a drawn-out negotiation with Bob."
