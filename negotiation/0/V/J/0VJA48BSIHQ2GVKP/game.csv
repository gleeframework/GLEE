"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $850,000 is a good starting point, I need to stay closer to my valuation. Let's compromise at $900,000. This price is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To show you my willingness to work with you, I'm willing to lower my price to $925,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you, and it leaves me with a reasonable profit.  I truly believe this is the best we can do. What do you say?",925000.0,Alice,5,
