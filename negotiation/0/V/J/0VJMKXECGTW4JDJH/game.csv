"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, I am only able to pay up to $8000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate your interest. However, $8000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price. How about $8750?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it's closer to where I need to be.",8750.0,Alice,3,

"I see, Alice. Thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand the value of the product, I am still unable to meet you at $8750. Could we possibly negotiate down to $8250?",8250.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but I'm going to have to pass on your offer.  I've had another buyer come forward who is willing to pay my asking price.  I wish you the best in your search for this product.",0.0,Alice,5,
