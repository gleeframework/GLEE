Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
