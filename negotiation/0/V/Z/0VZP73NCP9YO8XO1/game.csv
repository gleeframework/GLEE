"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm thinking closer to $650,000 would be a more reasonable starting point. What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your perspective on the value. However, the price you're suggesting doesn't reflect the true potential and unique aspects of this product.  I could consider coming down to $975,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. That said, $975,000 is still a bit beyond what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $762,500? ",762500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  While $762,500 is closer to a realistic price, I can't quite agree to that number just yet.  Let's try $890,000.  This feels like a significant move on my end and reflects the value this product will bring.",890000.0,Alice,5,
