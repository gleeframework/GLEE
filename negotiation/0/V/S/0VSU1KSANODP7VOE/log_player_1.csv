Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $150 for it, which is a great price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price of $150, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more. 
* **Positive Message:**  The message is friendly and tries to pique Bob's interest in the product. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message ends by asking for Bob's opinion, showing I'm open to a discussion.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** Great! I've successfully sold the product.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his counteroffer. If it's too low, I'll consider making a counter-offer or ending the negotiation with Bob and selling to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $80 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm not willing to sell the product for that amount. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've made a counteroffer of $130, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Justification:** I've provided a brief justification for my counteroffer by mentioning the product's value. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've ended the message by asking for Bob's opinion, keeping the conversation open.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a price closer to my initial goal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to assess his next counteroffer and decide whether to accept it, make another counteroffer, or sell to John for $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $100 is an improvement, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss, even if it means prolonging the negotiation. I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer in the next round, hoping to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $100 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $115?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I've made a counteroffer of $115, which is exactly in the middle of my last offer ($130) and Bob's last offer ($100). This shows that I'm willing to compromise and meet him halfway.
* **Emphasize Fairness:**  I've used the phrase ""fair price for both of us"" to emphasize that I'm trying to reach a mutually agreeable outcome. 
* **Keep it Simple:**  I've kept the message brief and focused on the offer to avoid unnecessary back-and-forth.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** I've successfully sold the product for a price that's slightly above my minimum but still allows Bob to get a good deal.
* **If Bob rejects:** I'll need to carefully consider my next move. If his counteroffer is too low, I'll be more inclined to sell to John for $120 and avoid further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $115 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work, I'll have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $105 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  While I would prefer to make a deal with Bob, selling to John for $120 is a better option than accepting a price that is less than my minimum.  It ensures I don't lose money and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
