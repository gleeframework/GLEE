"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,350,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John's offer.  Alice's starting price is significantly higher than her value, leaving room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's offer, aiming for a price closer to her product valuation. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Polite and Professional:** We want to maintain a good relationship with Alice throughout the negotiation. 
* **Expressing Interest:**  By stating we're interested but finding the price high, we signal our willingness to negotiate without revealing our budget ceiling."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $1,350,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and leaves a significant gain for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice moved her price down, but it's still above her perceived value of the product.  We have room to negotiate further before considering John's less favorable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  I'm getting closer to a price point where I can make this work.  Would you consider $1,150,000?"",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're making a smaller counteroffer increase this time ($50,000 instead of $150,000) to signal we're getting closer to our limit but still want to find a deal.
* **Positive Language:** We continue to use language that encourages negotiation and reinforces our genuine interest in the product.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Our offer is now slightly above the midpoint between our initial offer and Alice's current price.  This keeps us in the game while still aiming for a significant discount."
