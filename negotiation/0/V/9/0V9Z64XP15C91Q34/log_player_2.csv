"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can definitely get a better price than $1,000,000.  Alice values the product at $800,000, so there is room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he is willing to pay up to $1,200,000.  Accepting the offer saves Bob $250,000 compared to buying from John."
