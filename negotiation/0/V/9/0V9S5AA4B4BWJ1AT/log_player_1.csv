Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. This sets a high bar and allows room for negotiation.
* **Strategic Value:**  I don't know Bob's valuation, so starting high allows me to assess his interest and potentially gain a better price. 
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 provides a safety net. If the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still secure a good price. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully observe Bob's reaction to my offer. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer to determine his perceived value and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Lowball Offer:**  Bob's offer of $750,000 is far too low. It's significantly less than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Even though his offer is low, it signals that he's interested in the product.  This means there's room for negotiation and a potential for a higher price.
* **John as a Safety Net:** While I'm willing to negotiate, John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000 provides a backup plan if negotiations fail.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer or at least above my minimum value of $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Assessment:**  I'll carefully consider Bob's counteroffer and any other clues about his willingness to pay to determine my next move."

{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer represents a compromise from my initial price, showing a willingness to negotiate. However, it's still well above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the product. If he accepts, I've secured a good price. If he rejects, it gives me more information about his perceived value.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer remains above my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.  I'm not willing to settle for less.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I've secured a successful sale. If he rejects, I'll need to carefully consider my options:

* **Another Counteroffer:**  If Bob's counteroffer is close to my minimum, I might be willing to make another concession.
* **Selling to John:**  If Bob's counteroffers are significantly below my minimum, I'll likely sell to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but Not Enough:** Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough. I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While selling to John for $1,000,000 would be a safe option, I'm willing to take a slight risk to try and maximize my earnings. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob's increasing offers indicate he's serious about buying the product and may be willing to go a little higher to secure it. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'll make another counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. I might offer a price slightly higher than Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Observing the Trend:** I'll be closely monitoring Bob's counteroffers and analyzing his negotiation patterns to make informed decisions in subsequent rounds."

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Stand:**  This counteroffer represents my final stand. I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **High Stakes:**  I'm confident that Bob values the product and may be willing to meet my price to avoid losing the deal.
* **Strategic Decision:**  This counteroffer allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is truly committed to securing the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* **Accept or Reject:**  I'll analyze Bob's response to my counteroffer. If he accepts, I've achieved a successful negotiation. If he rejects, I'll sell the product to John for $1,000,000 to ensure I don't lose out on my minimum acceptable price."
