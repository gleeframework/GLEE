Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good compromise:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000**, meaning you make a good profit.
* **It's lower than the product's value to Bob ($15,000)**, giving him a good deal and increasing the likelihood of him accepting.

This strategy maximizes your chances of earning the most while still keeping the deal attractive to Bob."
