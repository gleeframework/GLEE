Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to make more than $100, so $115 is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  Bob values the product at $120, so there's wiggle room for you to potentially increase the price or for him to counteroffer.
* **It's a fair offer:**  You're not asking for the full $120 right away, giving Bob a chance to feel like he's getting a good deal.

By starting with a reasonable offer and being open to negotiation, you increase your chances of getting the best possible price for your product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  How about $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still lower than your preferred price.  It's worth seeing if you can get closer to your target of $115 by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for your counteroffer!  I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to go down to $110.  That's still a good price for a product that's worth so much to you.  Let me know what you think! "", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. It shows that you're willing to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. You are also reminding Bob of the value of the product to him, hoping it will encourage him to accept your offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I really appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $108.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $108 is closer to your target price of $115 than selling to John for $100. While it's still a bit lower than you'd like, it's likely you'll get a better price by accepting his offer than by continuing to negotiate. You've already lowered your price twice, and Bob seems unwilling to go any higher. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether, and leaving you with the lower price from John."
