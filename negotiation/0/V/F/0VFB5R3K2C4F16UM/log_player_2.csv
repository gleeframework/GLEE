{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

Alice's offer:

You should reject Alice's offer. While $110 is closer to your target price, you can still try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this quickly."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a good price for both of us and I'd like to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

You should accept Alice's offer.  $115 is still within your budget of $150 and you've already gone back and forth a few times. It's likely that Alice won't go any lower and you risk losing the deal entirely."
