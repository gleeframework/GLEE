,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $120 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. I think it's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $105.  This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to close this quickly.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you at $115, but that's as low as I can go. I think it's a good price for both of us and I'd like to finalize the deal.",115.0,Alice,5,
