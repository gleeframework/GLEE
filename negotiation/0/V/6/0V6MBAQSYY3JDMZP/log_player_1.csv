Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a great product that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $200. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want at least $150, so starting at $200 gives you some room to negotiate down.
* **It's not too high:** You don't want to scare Bob off with an unreasonable price right away. 
* **It sets the tone:** The message is friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to consider your offer.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, so accepting it is the best course of action. There's no point in risking a counteroffer and potentially going back and forth, especially since you have a guaranteed buyer in John for the same amount."
