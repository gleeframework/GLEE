Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $8,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,250? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I really need to stay within my budget.
