"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $2,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,400,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  This is a significant price reduction and a great opportunity for you to secure this valuable product. What do you say?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate the reduction, but $1,750,000 is still a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
