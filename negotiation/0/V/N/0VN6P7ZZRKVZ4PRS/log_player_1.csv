"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm aiming for a quick deal, but also leaving myself room to drop the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. It's below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, and I'm not willing to sell it for such a low price. I'm confident I can get a better deal from Bob or John. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $13,000,  which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,000 and $13,000. How about $12,200? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to sell the product for that price. I will counteroffer with a price closer to my desired range.  I still have time to negotiate with Bob or sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $12,200 is still not quite there for me. Let's try $12,800. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm confident it's a fair price for the value you'll receive."", ""product_price"": 12800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $12,800 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,800. How about $12,400? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,400 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm not yet ready to sell below my desired range, and I want to see if I can squeeze out another few hundred dollars from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $12,400 is still a little below where I need to be.  Let's split the difference and go with $12,600. I'm confident you'll find this a good deal, and it's the last compromise I'm willing to make."", ""product_price"": 12600}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're trying to be fair, but $12,600 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $12,600. How about $12,300? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're down to the wire, and with only three rounds left, it's not likely I'll get a better offer from Bob. He's stuck at $12,300, and while that's above his valuation, it's still below my desired minimum of $15,000. John is offering my desired price, so it's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing."
