"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will benefit your business. I'm willing to offer you the product for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to be flexible. I'm thinking of a compromise. I'll meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is the best I can do at this point.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9500, which is closer to my budget.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to consider my other options.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'll make one more counteroffer to try to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value of the product.",10750.0,Alice,5,
