"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair to both of us. Would you be interested in paying $120 for it? If not, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd rather sell it to you if possible. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
