"Round 1
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** It's above my maximum budget of $120.
* **There's room for negotiation:** I want to save money and I have 10 rounds to do so. 
* **John is a fallback option:** If negotiations with Alice fail, I can always buy from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. $110 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $105 for this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within my budget:** $105 is within my maximum budget of $120 and leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Significantly lower than Alice's offer:** This shows a strong desire to negotiate and hopefully gets Alice closer to my desired price.
* **Friendly tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages further negotiation and avoids potentially souring the deal."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high:** While it's lower than her first offer, it's still above my target price. I'm aiming to get the price down to $105.
* **I have more rounds:** I have 7 rounds left and I want to maximize my savings. 
* **John remains a backup option:** If I can't get Alice down to my target price, I can always go with John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $108 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on $105. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reiterate my target price:** I've already stated my willingness to pay $105, and I'm sticking to it.
* **Emphasize fairness:** Highlighting that $105 is fair for both of us can make Alice more inclined to accept.
* **Direct question:** This encourages Alice to make a decision and moves the negotiation forward."

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $106 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $105.50.  This would be a great price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the difference:** This demonstrates a willingness to compromise and shows that I'm taking her offer seriously.
