"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a competitive price of $1,200,000. It's a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's initial offer.  While it's a decent starting point, Bob can likely do better.  He knows the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, and there's room for negotiation to get closer to that value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value to me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  To move forward, I'm willing to drop my price slightly to $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects both our interests.  Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step closer to his target, he's still paying more than he'd like. He has John as an option for $1,000,000, making it worthwhile to keep negotiating with Alice to see if he can get even closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, and it brings us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me. To make progress, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  My final offer is $1,125,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's getting closer, he can still do better. He has John as an option for $1,000,000, so he should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get closer to that price.  There's still room for a counteroffer before he needs to seriously consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,125,000 is still slightly more than I'm willing to pay. I'm offering $1,105,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise and I believe it's a price that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1105000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement.  My final offer is $1,115,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,115,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  He has already gone through multiple rounds of negotiation and Alice's final offer of $1,115,000 is still above his ideal price.  He has a clear alternative with John that will save him $115,000.  While there is a chance he could continue negotiating and get Alice to go lower, the risk of Alice rejecting his next offer and leaving him with no deal is too high.  It's time to secure the product at the best price available."
