"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I've given your proposal some thought, and while I understand your perspective,  the product's value is considerably higher. I could be persuaded to part with it for $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, don't you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
