"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price. While $10000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11000. This still gives us both a good deal, and allows for a smooth transaction. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10250?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can get this deal done. Let's make it happen!",10250.0,Alice,5,
