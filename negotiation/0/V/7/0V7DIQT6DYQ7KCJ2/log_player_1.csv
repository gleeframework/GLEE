{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it'll be worth more than that to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a strong starting point. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the potential value to Bob, not just focusing on the price. This can make him more receptive to the offer.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  This price allows for some back and forth, which can help us find a mutually agreeable solution.
* **Having a backup:**  I have a fallback option with John, so I don't have to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While closer to my minimum, it's still below the $15,000 I'm willing to accept.  
* **Room for negotiation:** I can likely get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding selling to John:**  Selling to John would guarantee $15,000, but it's better to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $9,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to compromise.  How about $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still significantly higher than his initial offer.
* **Maintaining a positive tone:** I'm emphasizing the value proposition for Bob, making it less about simply haggling over a price. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  The price is still above my minimum. This allows me to potentially push for a higher price in subsequent rounds if necessary.
* **Signaling flexibility:** I'm showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  Even though Bob has increased his offer, it's still below the $15,000 minimum I'm comfortable with. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** There's a chance I can still get closer to my desired price by making a final counteroffer.
* **Avoiding selling to John yet:** While selling to John is tempting, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before settling. This is especially true since we're close to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to make this work. How about $10,000? That's a fair compromise, and it's still a great value for you. It's my final offer, so let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting some pressure on Bob.
* **Reasonable compromise:**  $10,000 is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, demonstrating flexibility while still being above my minimum.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reiterating the value proposition for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Close to the minimum:**  While I'm willing to go lower than my ideal price, it's still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer, and above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,500 and $10,000. How about $9,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum, but not there yet:**  $9,750 is still below my minimum of $15,000.  
* **Little room for further negotiation:**  Further negotiation might result in only a small increase, not worth the effort.
* **Avoiding a lengthy negotiation:**  The negotiation has gone on for a few rounds. Continuing it could be time-consuming.
* **Guarantee with John:**  Selling to John guarantees my minimum price.  It's the most reliable and efficient option at this point."
