"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget.  It's always better to try to negotiate and see if you can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my serious intent to negotiate and potentially get a much better deal.  It's also important to note that I'm still within my budget,  and if Alice rejects this offer, I have the option to further negotiate or go with John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to my maximum budget.  While I could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price, and I risk losing the opportunity to buy from Alice altogether. Accepting her offer ensures I get the product at my budget and saves time and potential further negotiation."
