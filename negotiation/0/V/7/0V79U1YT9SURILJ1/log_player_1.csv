Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it's a significant amount higher than my minimum value, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to entice Bob to make a counteroffer, giving me a chance to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell the product at such a drastic discount. I'll reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm counter-offering with $1,000,000. This is still a significant profit for me, but it's a more realistic price point given Bob's initial low offer. I believe this counteroffer is a good compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also maintains a reasonable profit margin for me."
