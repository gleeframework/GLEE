"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to save as much as I can. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11000, which is still a great price for you.  It allows me to get a fair price for the product, and it gives you a significant savings over what it's worth to you. Let's meet in the middle!",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000. How about $10500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
