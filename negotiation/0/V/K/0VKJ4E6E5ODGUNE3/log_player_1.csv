"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
