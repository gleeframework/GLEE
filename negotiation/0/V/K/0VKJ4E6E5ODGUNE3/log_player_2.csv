(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
$20,000 is significantly more than Bob's maximum budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

Bob should start with a low counteroffer. $10,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer and will test Alice's willingness to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

$17,500 is still above Bob's budget, but closer. It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

Bob should continue to slowly increase his offer, but still keep it significantly lower than Alice's price. $13,000 is a reasonable compromise, showing Bob is willing to pay more, but still wants a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $16,000 is getting closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than what he'd pay from John. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

Bob should keep increasing his offer, but in smaller increments. $14,000 is a reasonable middle ground between his previous offer and Alice's latest price. This shows Bob is serious about buying but still trying to get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is only $3,000 above Bob's target price, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There are only a few rounds left, and Bob might be able to get a better price with a final counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

Bob should make a final counteroffer close to Alice's last offer, but still within his budget.  $14,500 shows a willingness to close the deal, while still trying to get a better price.  With only a few rounds left, it's time to get serious."
