"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to a price. Since Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, there's a chance we can get it for less.  We have 10 rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's flexibility. A $2,000 reduction is a reasonable starting point, given the product's value to her. If she rejects, we can adjust our counteroffer in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to our desired price, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows us to continue exploring if we can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'm increasing my offer by $500. This demonstrates good faith while still aiming for a lower price.  We're halfway between our initial offer and Alice's last offer, which is a good strategy for closing the gap."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has matched our counteroffer from round 4. This is a good deal for us, as we are getting the product for $1,500 less than our initial budget.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a favorable price.  There's no guarantee we'll get a better price in the remaining rounds, and we risk losing the opportunity."
