"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good starting point, it's still above the product's value to Alice.  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  Since it's the first round, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is a good strategy to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is closer to my target price and a good compromise. Accepting this offer saves me $125,000 compared to buying from John. There is still room for negotiation, but the risk of losing the deal to John and ending up paying $1,000,000 is too high at this point."
