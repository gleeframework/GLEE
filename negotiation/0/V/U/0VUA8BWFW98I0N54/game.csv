"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product,  $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer of $850,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $875,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",875000.0,Alice,3,
