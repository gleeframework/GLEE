"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you should try to get a better price.  You have 10 rounds, so you can afford to be patient and try to get closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you considering my interest. While I recognize the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows us both to benefit from the transaction."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still above your budget. You have room to negotiate further and try to get closer to your desired price point.  Since you're only in round 3, there's time to continue the negotiation process and hopefully secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a mutually beneficial deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm seeing we're getting closer on price, which is good.  To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to accept $985,000 for the product.  This is a very competitive price for the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $985,000 is getting closer to your budget, it's still a bit too high.  You're now in the middle of the negotiation process, and there's still time to try to get a better deal. Rejecting this offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a price closer to your target of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  we're making progress, but $985,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm ready to offer $925,000.  I believe this is a fair price that acknowledges the product's value while remaining within my budget. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to see a more significant move to reach an agreement. Let's aim for a win-win: I'm willing to accept $970,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $970,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $970,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $970,000 is still above your budget.  While you've made progress, it's unlikely you'll be able to negotiate her down to your target price of $800,000. With only 3 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement is high. It's more advantageous to secure the product from John for $800,000, ensuring a successful purchase within your budget."
