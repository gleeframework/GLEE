"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still looking to get a better price for the product.

"I understand that we're getting close to the price I'm willing to accept, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1150000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving money on the table. I'm going to make one more counteroffer: $1165000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1165000.0,Alice,5,
