"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value your interest, $9,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,500? I think it's a fair compromise, and it'll allow both of us to walk away happy.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,200, but no higher. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",9200.0,Bob,4,
