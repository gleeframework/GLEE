"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000, which still leaves room for you to make a good profit.  This is my final offer. If you're not interested at this price, I'll be moving on to another buyer.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
