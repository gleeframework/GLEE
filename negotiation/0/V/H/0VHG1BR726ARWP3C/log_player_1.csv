Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850000 for your product.  This is a fair price considering my valuation and allows for a healthy profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
