"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but I am hoping to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9500? I believe this would still provide a good return for you while staying within my financial limits.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $10500. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make a deal. If not, I'll need to explore other opportunities.",10500.0,Alice,5,
