"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $95. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. This is a good starting point, but you can likely get a better deal.
* You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to see if you can get Alice to lower her price. 
* If you don't get a better price, you can always buy from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm hoping to pay. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're starting with a lower counteroffer, but still above Alice's value of $80. 
* This shows you're serious about buying the product, but also willing to negotiate. 
* You've given Alice room to counter without feeling pressured to accept your offer immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a little bit. How about $90? That's still a great price for this product, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price from $95 to $90, but you're still hoping to get a better deal. 
* You have more rounds to negotiate, and you're still in a good position to push for a lower price.
*  If you don't reach a better price, you can always purchase from John for $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $90 is still a bit too high for me. How about $87? That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You're inching closer to Alice's value, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* $87 is a reasonable compromise, demonstrating your commitment to the deal.
* Leaving room for Alice to counter ensures the negotiation continues."
