Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I think this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible, maximizing my profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000).
* **Strong but Fair:** The message positions the price as a reflection of the product's value, making it more palatable for Bob. 

This strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob without pushing him to reject the offer outright."
