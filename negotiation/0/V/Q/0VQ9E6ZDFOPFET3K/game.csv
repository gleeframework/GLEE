"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to me is $1200000.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still willing to negotiate. Considering the product's value to you is $1200000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1300000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product, but I'd like to propose a compromise. I'll throw in an additional service that I think will benefit you, worth $10000. This way, you'll get a better deal, and I'll get the product at a price I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your creative proposal, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I think the additional service you're offering is worth more than $10000. I'm willing to accept your offer, but I'd like to counter with a slightly higher price. I'll sell the product to you for $1275000. This way, we can both benefit from the deal.",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1275000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $1225000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's worth to me is $1200000. What do you think?",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1225000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $1230000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $1200000.",1230000.0,Alice,7,
