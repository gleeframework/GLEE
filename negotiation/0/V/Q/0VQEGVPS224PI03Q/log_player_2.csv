"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on this amazing product at a discounted price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000, and John is offering it at that price, it's the safest option. There's no reason to take a risk on Alice's offer, as you don't know her bottom line and there's no benefit to accepting her price."
