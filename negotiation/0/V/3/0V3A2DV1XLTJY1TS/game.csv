"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $80, and I'm confident you'll love it!",120.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go down to $90 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $110. It's still a great deal considering its value to you is $80, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $95 for the product. That's the highest I can go.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is your maximum budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell it to you for $105. It's a compromise, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you is $80. Let me know what you think!",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really not comfortable going any higher than $95, Alice. I think that's the fairest price we can agree on. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying from another seller.",95.0,Bob,6,
