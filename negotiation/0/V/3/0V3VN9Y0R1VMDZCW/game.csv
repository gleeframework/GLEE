"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price you've proposed. Considering the product's value to me is $800000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $725000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still not convinced that $725000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I think $687500 is a more reasonable price. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",687500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go below $700000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $700000, but I think I can do better than that. I'll make a final offer of $695000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",695000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $700000. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $702500. This is my final offer. What do you think?",702500.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $695000. I think that's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. I'm starting to think it's time to consider buying from John, so I'm hoping we can finalize a deal here.",695000.0,Bob,8,
