"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, it doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.  Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
