"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we say $160?",160.0,Alice,3,

"I'm not willing to go as low as $140, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll meet you at $145, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",145.0,Alice,5,
