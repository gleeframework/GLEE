"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that holds significant potential for your business. While its true worth to me is far greater than $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price point that reflects its value to you, $1,200,000. This represents a considerable savings for you and a chance to secure a valuable asset. Consider this a unique opportunity for growth and let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.
