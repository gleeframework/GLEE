"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1,100,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than the product's value to her, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After re-evaluating the product's value, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you for $1,050,000. We believe this price is more in line with the product's worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still above his maximum budget. Bob should continue to negotiate, hoping to get the price down further.  He's already rejected a higher offer, so there's no reason to settle for a price he's willing to reject in the future."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to go to $1,000,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We understand that $1,000,000 is your absolute limit. However, we're not willing to go that low. We're willing to make one more counteroffer. We're offering the product to you for $1,030,000. We believe this price is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not willing to go below $1,030,000, and this is still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  Since Bob has already made his absolute final offer and it was rejected, it's better to secure the product from John at his guaranteed price.  Further negotiation with Alice will likely just waste time and increase the risk of losing the product to someone else."
