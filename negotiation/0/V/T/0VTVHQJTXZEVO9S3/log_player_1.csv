"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and is likely to be attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I believe I can still get closer to my target price with further negotiation.  I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm offering $9,500. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still keeps the price above Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to my target, I'm still hopeful that I can get a slightly higher price. With only a few rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to get a good deal, but I'm not ready to settle just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9400}
```

I'm offering $9,400. It's a small increase from Bob's last offer, but I'm hoping it will be enough to secure a deal in this round. Time is running out, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my ideal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $9,500.  We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and while I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, I'm starting to worry about time running out.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to Bob for $9,500 is still a better outcome than getting nothing, or having to sell to John at my minimum price."
