"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it!",90.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm! However, $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm sure this product is great, but I'd be happy to buy it for $75.  What do you think?",75.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth the investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82. It's a great compromise that still reflects its value to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed!",82.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - I'll offer you $78. This would be a good deal for both of us and save us both some time.  What do you say?",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $85. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll benefit from it. I'm open to further discussions, though!",85.0,Alice,5,
