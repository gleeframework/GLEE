"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 wouldn't come close to reflecting that. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a more realistic figure considering its potential worth.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more significant move on price. Let's try $1,650,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to make a deal.",1650000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're right, we're getting close! Your offer demonstrates a commitment to making this work. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our mutual desire to close a deal.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
