"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a price higher than your desired outcome. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,300,000, you establish a high anchor point in Bob's mind. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Confident Tone:** The message conveys confidence in the product's value, which can subtly influence Bob's perception. 

This is just the opening move.  How Bob responds will determine the next step in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price is quite a bit higher than I was thinking.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. Accepting his initial offer would leave a substantial amount of money on the table. 

It's too early to sell to John. While his offer guarantees your minimum, there's a good chance you can negotiate a better deal with Bob with some more rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $800,000 wouldn't come close to reflecting that. To move this forward, I could consider a price of $1,900,000.  This feels like a more realistic figure considering its potential worth."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:** The counteroffer drops considerably from the initial price, demonstrating flexibility. However, it remains well above your $1,500,000 minimum and even slightly above the midpoint between your initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's value. By reiterating this, you aim to nudge Bob's perception closer to yours. 
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to find a compromise while still keeping the negotiation active. It encourages Bob to engage further and potentially move closer to your desired price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, $950,000 is still significantly below your $1,500,000 walk-away point.  You have some room to negotiate further before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a more significant move on price. Let's try $1,650,000.  This is a substantial reduction on my part, reflecting my desire to make a deal."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** This counteroffer represents a significant concession from your previous offer while still remaining above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Testing the Waters:** By moving closer to your minimum, you can gauge Bob's willingness to negotiate within a range closer to your target.
* **Urgency and Deal-Making:** The message emphasizes your desire to close a deal, which might encourage Bob to reciprocate with a more substantial counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer.  To meet you halfway, I can offer $1,100,000. This is a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer! Bob's offer is now above his perceived value, signaling a strong interest in the product.  However, you still have room to negotiate before settling for anything below John's offer. Let's see if we can push him a bit further in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we're getting close! Your offer demonstrates a commitment to making this work. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value and our mutual desire to close a deal."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession, Firm Stance:** This offer represents a small concession from your previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's positioned as your ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and convey the seriousness of the price point.
* **Just Above Minimum:** By staying just above your $1,500,000 safety net (John's offer), you maximize your potential gain while still leaving a small margin for potential negotiation.
* **Justification and Appeal:** The message reiterates the product's value and emphasizes your shared interest in reaching an agreement. 

This strategy aims to either close the deal now at a favorable price or prompt Bob to reveal his final and best offer in the next round."
