"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $950,000? This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $920,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to be closer to $950,000. How about $940,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and allow you a profitable return on the product.  Let's try to make this work.",940000.0,Alice,5,
