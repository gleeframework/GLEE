Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $900,000 is still too low for me, especially with John offering $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $900,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $950,000? This would still allow you a good profit margin, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $920,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While we're getting closer, $920,000 is still significantly less than what I need to get. I'm hoping I can get a better offer from Bob, or at least push him closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $920,000 just isn't enough for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to be closer to $950,000. How about $940,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and allow you a profitable return on the product.  Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 940000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it seems like he's not willing to budge much further.  John is offering a much better price, and I don't want to risk losing out on that opportunity."
