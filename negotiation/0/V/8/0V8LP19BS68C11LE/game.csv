"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider this counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to be flexible to reach a deal.  While $900,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I could consider coming down to $1,050,000.  This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider this counteroffer?",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best possible price, and I respect that.  However, I need to be realistic about the value of this product.  I can't go any lower than $987,500.  This offer is my final one, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us.",987500.0,Alice,7,
