"Alice, $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, considering its value to me. I'm confident we can reach a fair agreement if we work together.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $12,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $18,000 is still outside my budget. I'm happy to offer $15,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value to both of us. I'm confident this is a win-win situation.",15000.0,Bob,4,
