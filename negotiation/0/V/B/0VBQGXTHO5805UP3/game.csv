"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $120 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand where you're coming from, but $120 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $150? That's the lowest I can go.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $130, which is a fair compromise. Let me know what you think.",130.0,Bob,4,
