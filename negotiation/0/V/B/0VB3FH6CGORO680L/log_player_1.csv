Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is just below your minimum, it leaves a slight possibility for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 
* **Time Sensitivity:** By mentioning a ""limited time,"" you create a sense of urgency that might push Bob to accept.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing if Bob would be willing to pay more than $100. If you had additional information about Bob's potential willingness to pay, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
