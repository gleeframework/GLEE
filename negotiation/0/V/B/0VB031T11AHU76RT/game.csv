"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to make a serious investment in this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still leaves some room for negotiation. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,350,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,300,000. Can you consider this revised counteroffer?",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's work towards a final agreement. ",1325000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  while I appreciate your efforts, $1,312,500 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one last time and offer $1,318,750. This is my final offer. Let's make this deal happen.",1318750.0,Alice,7,
