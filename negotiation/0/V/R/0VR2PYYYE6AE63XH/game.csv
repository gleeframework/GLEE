"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? This would allow us both to get a fair deal.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $8,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something closer to $7,000. Would you be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $7,000 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go lower to $8,000, but that's my final offer. It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",8000.0,Alice,5,
