"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price that recognizes some of the value I see in it.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value it will bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product has value, but so does my time.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my limit for this negotiation.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options.",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I respect your time and your need to explore other options. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,700,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of this product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a substantial gap. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  I need to make a decision today.",800000.0,Bob,6,
