"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you for $2,300,000. This is a starting point for our discussion, and I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to offer $500,000 for the product. It's a fair price that recognizes some of the value I see in it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. While selling to John is always an option, it's worth negotiating further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $500,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point reflects the value it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but so does my time.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000, but that's my limit for this negotiation.  If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still too low.  While he's indicating some urgency, there's room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $1,000,000 before accepting defeat and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your time and your need to explore other options. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my price to $1,700,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my end while still recognizing the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but there's still a substantial gap. I'm willing to go up to $800,000. This is my final offer - take it or leave it.  I need to make a decision today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer has increased, he's made it clear that $800,000 is his absolute limit. It's unlikely further negotiation will bridge the gap to a price point acceptable to me.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best decision to ensure I receive a fair value for the product."
