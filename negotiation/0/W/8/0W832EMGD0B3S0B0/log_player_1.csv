Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept right away. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to see if he's genuinely interested and what his budget might be.  If he rejects, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm willing to negotiate further. I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob. If he rejects again, I'll have to decide whether to accept his offer or try to sell to John."
