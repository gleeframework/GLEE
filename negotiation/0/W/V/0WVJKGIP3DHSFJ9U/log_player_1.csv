Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering a fantastic product for a limited time. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $150.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to earn as much as possible. Starting with a higher offer gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the product is worth $100 to both of us, there's always a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** I have a safety net with John, ensuring I won't get less than $100. This allows me to be bolder with my initial offer to Bob."
