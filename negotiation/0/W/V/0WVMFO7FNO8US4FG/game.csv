"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I agree this product could be valuable for my business, but the price point you're suggesting is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to  $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway there. While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $725,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to your business. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
