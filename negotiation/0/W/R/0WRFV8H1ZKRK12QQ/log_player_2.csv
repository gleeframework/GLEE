Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?  That's a fair price for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice's bottom line:** Alice has signaled that $80 is her absolute lowest price.  She's even introduced the idea of another buyer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Your target:** Your goal was to buy the product for under $100. Accepting this offer saves you $20. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Continuing to negotiate could backfire. Alice might walk away, forcing you to buy from John at the full $100."
