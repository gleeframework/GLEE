"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $100 to you, so you want to pay less than that. $90 is too high, so rejecting Alice's offer and counter-offering is the best course of action."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $90 is a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $85 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you the product for $92.50 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $92.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $92.50 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet at $87.50. It's a fair price that's closer to what I can afford and still allows you to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 87.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I still need to make a profit, so I can offer you the product for $92.00. It's a fair price that's close to our previous discussions and still below your original offer of $100.

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but if she doesn't budge I might have to buy from John instead."
