"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it has immense value to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above what the product is worth to her.  There's room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better deal."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. What do you think?

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than what the product is worth to her, and Bob can likely secure a better price. Rejecting this offer allows Bob to make another counteroffer and potentially get closer to his desired price."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your persistence, Bob. I understand your desire to get the best deal, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and propose a counteroffer of $885,000.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is getting closer to Bob's desired range.** While $885,000 is still above what Bob initially wanted, it's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and closer to Bob's counteroffers. 
* **The risk of losing the deal:** If Bob rejects this offer, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further. Additionally, there's the risk that Bob could exhaust his negotiating leverage and be forced to buy from John at a higher price.
* **A good compromise:**  $885,000 is a good compromise for Bob as it allows him to save money compared to buying from John and still secures the product."
