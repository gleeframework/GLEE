"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value."", ""product_price"": 140}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $140 is a bit too high for me. How about $130?  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
At $130, the offer is still a significant margin above my minimum price of $120.  There's no guarantee I can get a better offer from Bob in further rounds, and it's better to secure a good deal now than risk getting stuck with a lower offer or having to sell to John for $120.
