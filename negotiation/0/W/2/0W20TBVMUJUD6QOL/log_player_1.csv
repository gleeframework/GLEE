"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters. I want to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to play in this price range. If he rejects, I can lower it slightly in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $1,300,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's current offer. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more than what Bob is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While I'm running out of time, I'm not yet ready to settle for $1,100,000. I'm willing to risk losing the deal with Bob and see if he'll counter with a higher offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm dropping my price again to $1,200,000. I'm getting closer to Bob's last offer, and I'm hoping this signals that I'm serious about making a deal. However, I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum, so I'm not accepting his offer just yet."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer is now at my minimum, but I've already rejected him twice at this price.  With only 4 rounds left, I don't think I can squeeze out any more profit, and risking a rejection from Bob could leave me with nothing. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and saves me time and negotiation effort."
