Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum, but I'm not quite there yet. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

``` 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $100. It makes more sense to cut your losses and buy from John at the guaranteed $100 price."
