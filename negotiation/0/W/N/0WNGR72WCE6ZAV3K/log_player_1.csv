**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's unlikely to reach our $1,500,000 minimum within the remaining rounds.  We have a guaranteed offer from John at that price. It's strategically better to secure the guaranteed amount now than risk Bob not meeting our minimum in the remaining rounds."
