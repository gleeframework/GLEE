Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's closer to my desired price, it's still significantly below what I value the product at. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price range in the next few rounds."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I'm still confident that I can get a better deal. I want to see if I can push him a little bit further in the next round before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and willingness to negotiate. I'm happy to meet you in the middle and offer $10,400. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a good deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10400}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $10,200. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a tough decision, as I'm still below my ideal price. However, Bob is getting very close to my target and I'm not sure how much more I can push him. It's possible I could get a better offer in the next round, but it's also possible he'll walk away. At this point, accepting his offer is the most sensible option to ensure I get a sale and avoid the risk of losing a potential buyer."
