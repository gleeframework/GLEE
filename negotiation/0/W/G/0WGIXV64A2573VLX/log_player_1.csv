"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a good profit. I'm confident that Bob will be willing to pay a premium for the product since it's worth $15,000 to him.  Let's see how the negotiation unfolds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to make the deal more appealing to Bob. I believe $12,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. This way, we can both walk away with a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll see if I can push him up a bit more before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground.  $11,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a decent profit. Let's see if he bites."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This time, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not ideal, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that if I keep rejecting, he'll walk away completely.  $10,500 is better than selling to John for $10,000, and we're getting close to the end of the rounds. It's time to close the deal."
