Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can push for a higher price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if he's willing to compromise further."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not ideal, it's very close to my minimum and I'm not sure how much more I can get out of him.  It's also a lot better than selling to John, since I'll get $1,360,000 instead of $1,500,000."
