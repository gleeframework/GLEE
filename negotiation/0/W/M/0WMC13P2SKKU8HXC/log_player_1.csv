Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name]. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique asset, and I believe it will be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to aim higher with Bob. Starting at $1,500,000 leaves room for negotiation while maximizing potential profit.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and positions it as an exclusive opportunity, making Bob feel like he's getting something special. 
* **Justification:** While not overly detailed, mentioning ""value and potential"" provides a light justification for the high price without revealing your bottom line. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:**  While you know the product's worth to Bob, consider if there are any external factors (market conditions, competition) that might affect his willingness to pay above $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** Be prepared to negotiate. If Bob rejects the initial offer, having a counter-offer strategy in mind will be crucial. You could gradually reduce the price, but never going below your $1,200,000 safety net with John."
