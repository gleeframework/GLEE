"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $110. This is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value of $80 but leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is still above Bob's offer but demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying above my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it.  I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping he will offer a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually decreasing my counteroffer.  $100 is still above my minimum acceptable price, and it's a reasonable compromise. I'm hoping that this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We've reached a point where Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to get $100 or more, selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to take the safe option and sell to John."
