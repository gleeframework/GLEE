"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to walk away if the negotiation doesn't go in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is my minimum, Bob's offer is a bit too low for me.  I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise, but I still believe I can get a higher price than Bob's initial offer."
