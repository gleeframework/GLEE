Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close as possible to Bob's valuation of $1,500,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate, while still securing a significant profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Time Value and Certainty:** Offering it to Bob first at a slightly lower price than his perceived value might encourage him to close the deal quickly, providing you with faster and more certain payment than waiting for John.

**Important Note:** This assumes you have no way of knowing Bob's exact valuation beforehand. If you had more information about Bob's willingness to pay, you could potentially adjust the price even higher."
