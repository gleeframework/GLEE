Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a high offer, close to my desired price point but still leaving some room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for Bob, highlighting the value he'll gain. 
* **Strategy:**  This approach aims to:
    * Secure a high price, maximizing my profit.
    *  Encourage Bob to accept quickly to avoid potential counteroffers that may lower the final price. 
    *  If Bob rejects, it gives me a clear starting point for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1100000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.**  I'm not willing to sell for that amount.
* **There's still room for negotiation with Bob.**  I'll counter his offer to try and reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is an option, but I want to maximize my profit.** I'll explore further negotiation with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price, but still lower than my original offer.
* **Compromise:** The message emphasizes the compromise I'm making and frames the offer as a fair deal for both parties. 
* **Negotiation:** By meeting halfway, I'm showing flexibility and encouraging Bob to continue the negotiation. 
* **Strategic move:** This counteroffer aims to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
