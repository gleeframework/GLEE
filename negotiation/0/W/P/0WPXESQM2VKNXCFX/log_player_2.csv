"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1100000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  You can get the product for less, either by negotiating with Alice or buying from John.  Rejecting allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900000 is too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1000000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is within your budget. It's also better than buying from John for $1,200,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice could reject your counteroffer and you'd be left with no deal. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price."
