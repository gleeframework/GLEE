"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm aiming for a price around $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product,  $18,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it, which is what I'd be paying from another seller. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $18,000 is my initial asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I'm only able to offer $13,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a compromise.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It seems we're getting closer. How about we split the difference and settle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I'm glad we're making progress.  $14,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to consider $13,500?  I think that's a fair compromise.",13500.0,Bob,6,
