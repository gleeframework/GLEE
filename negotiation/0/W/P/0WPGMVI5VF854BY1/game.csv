"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10000 is just too low for me. However, I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $14000?  This is still a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise. However, $14000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $12000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,
