"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is higher than my budget. I'm very interested in your product and willing to pay up to $850000. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 1200000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1000000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1000000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850000. This is a fair price considering the value I bring to your product and the potential for a long-term partnership. Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of 850000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for 950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table.",950000.0,Alice,5,
