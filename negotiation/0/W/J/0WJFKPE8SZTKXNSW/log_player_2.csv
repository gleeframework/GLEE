Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,200,000 is above his budget, and he can get a better deal from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 1200000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 1000000. This is a great deal, considering the value it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, $1,000,000 is still outside his budget. He can still get the product for a lower price from John."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I bring to your product and the potential for a long-term partnership. Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of 850000, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for 950000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice has lowered her price to $950,000, Bob should still choose to buy from John. At this point, it seems Alice is unwilling to go lower than $950,000 and John is offering a guaranteed price of $800,000.  Bob should take the sure thing and buy from John to save $150,000."
