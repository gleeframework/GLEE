# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in.  It's worth $80 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that's a bit lower than what I could get elsewhere.  Would you be interested in paying $120 for it?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","I will reject Alice's offer because I can get the product for cheaper from John.
