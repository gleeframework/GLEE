"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1400000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and leaves room for both of us to make a deal.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1250000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1300000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me and still leaves some room for you to make a profit.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1300000 is closer, it's still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1275000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go below $1290000. This is the minimum price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you $1285000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me.",1285000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer to a deal. While I appreciate your offer, $1285000 is still slightly outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the value I see in it while still allowing us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1225000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get as close to your budget as possible, but I'm not willing to go below $1290000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer you $1280000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for the product, considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1280000.0,Alice,7,
