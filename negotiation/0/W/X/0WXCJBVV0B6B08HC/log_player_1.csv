Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your efforts to meet halfway, Alice. Considering the value and quality of the product, I believe we could agree on a price of $14,000. This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and secure the sure thing."
