You should reject Alice's offer. You can still get a better deal.  There's a good chance Alice will counter at a lower price, or you can offer slightly higher than your last offer.  You have room to negotiate before needing to purchase from John."

Alice's offer of $11,050 is too high.  You are close to your limit of $12,000, so it's better to buy from John at this point to avoid further negotiations."
