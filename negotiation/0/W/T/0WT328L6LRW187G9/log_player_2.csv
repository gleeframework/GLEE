"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price down closer to his target of $10,000.  Rejecting allows for a counteroffer and potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for further negotiation and hopefully a win-win outcome for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $12,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly lower than John's price and still allows Bob to acquire the product for a price below his maximum limit. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a favorable price and avoids the risk of further negotiation or having to pay John's higher price."
