Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth more than that to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming for more than your minimum of $10,000.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so he has room to negotiate.
* **It's a strong first offer:** It shows you're serious about getting a good price, but it leaves room for negotiation.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to Bob and what you initially offered.  Rejecting his offer allows you to try and get closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still keeping your price higher than Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting the value:** Emphasizing the deal for Bob keeps the negotiation focused on his perceived value of the product. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  $12,000 is still above your minimum, so you have room to negotiate further if needed."
