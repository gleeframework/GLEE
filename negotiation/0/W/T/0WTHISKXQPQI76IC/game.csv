"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me. However, $14,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and I appreciate your willingness to meet my expectations. I am willing to consider your offer of $12,500. However, I would like to propose an alternative: let's aim for a middle ground at $13,500. This would allow us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $13,500 is still a little above what I can afford right now. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price for both of us. I hope you can consider this offer.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. I'm glad we're able to communicate effectively. Considering your latest offer of $13,000, I'm willing to accept this amount as it aligns well with my expectations. Thank you for your cooperation, and I look forward to completing this transaction.",13000.0,Alice,5,
