"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in.  My starting price is $18,000.  I'm confident it's a great value for you, but I'm open to discussing a fair price.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm keen on the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair starting point for negotiations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. $12,000 is a bit too far off for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This feels like a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit.  How about we settle closer to the middle ground at $14,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we're getting closer. Let's try $15,500.  I'm feeling flexible at this point, but I can't go lower than my minimum.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is a fair offer and I appreciate your flexibility.  To be honest with you, I can get a similar product elsewhere for $15,000. To avoid that hassle, I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $14,500.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $14,500 is still a bit low for me. This is my final offer, I'm willing to go down to $15,000. If you're not interested, I'll be moving on to another buyer. ",15000.0,Alice,7,
