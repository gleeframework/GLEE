"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to let it go for $12,000.  This is a great price considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is less than your $15,000 maximum, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to her ($8,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal and might incentivize Alice to come down in price."
