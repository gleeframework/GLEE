"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'm interested in the product, though. How about $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us.",92.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $92.50 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $88, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think.",88.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $88 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $90.  This would be a good price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,5,
