"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $11,500?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 if we can close the deal now. This offer stands for this round only.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is still pushing it a bit for me. How about we settle at $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,6,
