"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value and features, I'm asking for $20,000. I think it's a fair price that reflects its worth."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. It's worth seeing if I can negotiate him up.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  However, $16,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Could you do $11,500?  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","While Bob is inching closer, that's still too much of a loss for me. I'll try one more time to get him closer to my acceptable range.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $11,500 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $14,000 if we can close the deal now. This offer stands for this round only."", ""product_price"": 14000}"

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is still pushing it a bit for me. How about we settle at $12,500? This would be a good deal for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
