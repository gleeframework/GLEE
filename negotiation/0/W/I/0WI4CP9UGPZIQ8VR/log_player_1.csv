Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, while still securing a significant profit above my minimum ($800,000).
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 might make Bob feel like he has no room to negotiate and could lead to him rejecting the offer outright. 
 
This strategy balances risk and reward. There's a chance Bob might try to negotiate the price down, but it's a calculated risk to aim for a higher profit margin."
