"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your business. Given its value and the impact it could have on your operations, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $12,000. This represents an excellent opportunity to acquire a high-quality asset at a competitive rate. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further or if there's any way I can assist you in making a decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Even though Alice's offer is lower than the product's worth to her, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000. He can get the same product from John for $10,000, so rejecting Alice's offer is the better choice."
