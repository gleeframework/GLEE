Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. This is a fantastic opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation:**  You are aware that the product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Having a backup buyer:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.
* **Aiming for maximum profit:** Your goal is to get the highest possible price.

Therefore, starting with a high offer of $19,000 makes sense. While it's unlikely Bob will accept this, it leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can gradually decrease the price, potentially settling somewhere above your minimum of $15,000. 

**Important:** This strategy assumes you have some time for negotiation and are not in a rush to make the sale."
