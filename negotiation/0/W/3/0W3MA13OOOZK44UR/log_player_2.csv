"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth, I propose a starting price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $12,000, but her offer is already at $10,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible.** You have 10 rounds to work with, and it's worth trying to get a better price.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll make a counteroffer, aiming to get a price closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $10,000 is a bit high for me right now. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering our previous discussions and the value you place on the product, I propose a price of $9,500 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.**  While it's closer to your desired price, you're still aiming to save more.
* **You still have room for negotiation.** You have 7 rounds left, so there's time to try and bring the price down further.

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, you'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price even closer to your $9,000 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $9,000.  This is my best price, let me know if it works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. After careful consideration, I am willing to sell the product for $9,250. This is my final offer based on the value you've expressed for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.** It's only $250 above your ideal $9,000.
* **You have limited time and rounds.** You only have 5 rounds left, and there's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a price increase or deadlock. 
* **John's offer is higher.**  You can always go with John if this deal falls through, so it's a good idea to lock in a decent price while you have the chance.

**Conclusion:**

Accepting this offer allows you to save a significant amount compared to buying from John, and you still get a good deal.  It's a good balance of risk and reward."
