"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point: 

* **It's above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000).** This ensures you're still getting a good deal.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value ($10,000).** This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It sets the tone for the negotiation.** It shows you are serious about making a deal, but also that you are willing to compromise. 

Let's see what Bob does!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to buy it for $8500. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above your minimum acceptable price, you can potentially get more. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter and see if you can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9000}
