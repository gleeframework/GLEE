"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'd be willing to buy it for $8,500. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob starts by making a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to Alice's value of $8,000.
* **Reasoning:** Bob provides a reason for the counteroffer, suggesting he's looking for a specific price range. This can help keep the negotiation friendly and focused. 
* **Room for Compromise:** While this counteroffer is ambitious, there's room for both parties to compromise and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.  Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Compromise:** Alice's offer of $9,000 is a good compromise, splitting the difference between Bob's last offer and her previous offer.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate could be risky, especially since Bob can always buy from John for $10,000.  
* **Potential Savings:** While Bob could try to negotiate further, accepting this offer still saves him $1,000 compared to buying from John."
