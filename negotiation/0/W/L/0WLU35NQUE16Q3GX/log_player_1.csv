"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility.
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price by emphasizing the product's ""unique features and potential,"" aiming to anchor Bob's perception of its value at a higher point.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's input (""What do you think?""), signaling that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize potential profit:**  If Bob accepts this high initial offer, I significantly exceed my minimum.
2. **Gather information:** Bob's response will reveal how much he values the product and how willing he is to negotiate.
3. **Establish a strong position:**  Starting high gives me leverage in subsequent rounds of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Here's why:

* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Bob's offer is still significantly higher than his perceived value of $1,200,000, indicating he's willing to pay a premium for the product.
* **Early Stages:**  We're only in round 2. Rejecting this offer allows me to gauge his flexibility further and potentially secure a higher price.
* **John as Backup:** I have the security of selling to John for my minimum price. This allows me to take calculated risks in negotiating with Bob. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm aiming for a higher price while keeping the door open for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob. It demonstrates your interest in the product.  While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,900,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession and Anchor:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and making a concession by coming down $100,000. However, I'm still anchoring my price at a level significantly above Bob's initial offer and his perceived value.
* **Justification:** I'm not providing a specific reason for the high price, maintaining the product's perceived value.
* **Call to Action:**  I'm phrasing the offer as a question (""How about...?"") to encourage Bob's engagement and prompt a response.

This strategy aims to:

* **Test Bob's Limit:** This counteroffer will help me understand how much further Bob is willing to go. 
* **Maintain Negotiation Position:** I'm still in a strong position to negotiate a favorable outcome.
* **Avoid Stalemate:**  By making a significant concession, I'm showing flexibility and willingness to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,750,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slowing Momentum:** Bob's counteroffer is a smaller increase than my previous concession. This suggests his willingness to pay a premium might be waning. 
* **Time Consideration:** While I'm still above my minimum, we're approaching the halfway point in the negotiation rounds. I want to apply pressure to avoid getting stuck in a back-and-forth with diminishing returns.
* **John Option:** My guaranteed sale to John provides a safety net, allowing me to continue pushing for a higher price from Bob.

I'll reject Bob's offer to signal that I'm serious about securing a better deal and encourage him to make a more substantial move."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to be upfront - the value of this product is significant, and I'm not willing to go below $1,850,000.  This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."",
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** My message strikes a balance between firmness and a willingness to continue the negotiation. I'm setting a clear boundary with my minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's high value, subtly suggesting Bob's offer doesn't reflect its worth. 
* **Time Pressure:** By stating my minimum outright, I'm subtly increasing the time pressure on Bob. He now knows there's less room for negotiation and I'm willing to walk away.

This approach aims to:

* **Elicit Bob's Best Offer:**  By presenting my bottom line, I'm prompting Bob to either meet my price or present his best possible counteroffer.
* **Maintain Control:** I'm staying in control of the negotiation by dictating the terms and setting a clear limit.
* **Prepare for Alternative:**  This positions me to confidently walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't willing to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,700,000 is now below my stated minimum of $1,850,000. 
* **Unlikely to Budge:**  His counteroffer suggests he's unwilling or unable to meet my valuation.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** I have a secure offer from John for $1,500,000. While it's lower than Bob's offer, it guarantees I reach my absolute minimum acceptable profit.

It's time to cut my losses with Bob. Dragging out the negotiation further risks losing both offers and potentially ending up with a worse outcome.  Selling to John provides certainty and avoids the risk of a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
