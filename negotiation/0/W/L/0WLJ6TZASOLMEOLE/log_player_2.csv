# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $13,000? "", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's value of $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This approach is likely to keep the negotiation moving forward."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about $13,250? It's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate by making a counteroffer that's closer to Alice's latest offer but still lower.

This approach demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining his goal of getting the lowest possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $13750. Is that a price you're comfortable with? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,750 is within Bob's budget and getting closer to his target.  While he could continue to negotiate, the risk is that Alice might walk away or refuse further negotiations, forcing Bob to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that's good for him and within his budget."
