{

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable point, we're still significantly above my minimum price.  I'm willing to push a bit further to see if we can land closer to $1,150,000.  I need to start signaling some firmness though, as Bob seems to be pushing for a lower price point."

{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is not budging significantly, and his offers are approaching my absolute bottom line. It's clear he's trying to squeeze me for the best possible price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a real risk he won't go much higher.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $800,000.  It's a sure thing and avoids the risk of Bob lowballing me further in the remaining rounds."
