It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You can likely get a better price than $850,000, especially since your maximum budget is $800,000."

I'm offering Alice $750,000. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still within my budget. It gives her some room to negotiate while still leaving me some room to potentially make a higher counteroffer if necessary."

I'm offering Alice $780,000. This is a slightly higher offer than my previous counteroffer, but still below my maximum budget and closer to her last offer.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us."
