{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is a good price, but Bob can likely get a better deal. 
* **Strategy:** Reject the offer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $14,000 is good, but Bob wants to test the waters and see if Alice will accept a lower price. 
* **Strategy:** Offer a lower price, starting with a $1,000 discount, to see if Alice is willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,500 is a good price, considering Bob's initial counteroffer of $13,000 was rejected. 
* **Strategy:** Accept Alice's offer. It's a good compromise and allows Bob to save $1,500 compared to buying from John.  There is a good chance that continuing to negotiate won't result in a significantly lower price, and Bob risks losing the deal or running out of rounds."
