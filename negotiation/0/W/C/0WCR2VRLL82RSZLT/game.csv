"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident you'll see the value. My starting price is $900,000. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure we can find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this unique product. I'm offering you the product for $850,000. This is a good compromise, and I believe we can finalize the deal here.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair return, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise.",825000.0,Bob,4,
