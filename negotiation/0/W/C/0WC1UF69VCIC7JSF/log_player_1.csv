Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. It's also important to note that this is a very valuable product to me, so I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000.  I'll be watching Bob's response to see if he's interested in negotiating or if he's more likely to walk away."
