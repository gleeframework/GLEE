"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for it.  Let me know if that's a number we can work with.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value of this product.  While $1,300,000 is a strong offer, I believe its potential for you warrants a price closer to my initial proposal. Would you consider $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you see the potential in this product, and I do too.  However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1,300,000. It's my final offer.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
