"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $13,000. I believe this offer reflects the value it holds for you.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $13,000 is still more than the product is worth to him. He should try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your perspective, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
