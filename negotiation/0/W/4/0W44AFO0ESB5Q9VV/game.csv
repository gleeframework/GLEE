"Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher.  To move us closer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This offer reflects the product's potential for a significant return on your investment.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice. However, I still think $1,150,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
