# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a price closer to $675,000, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $700,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is firm on her price, and $700,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer."
