"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to begin with a strong offer. This leaves room for potential concessions while still aiming for a price close to Bob's perceived value. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's value, we subtly anchor the price in Bob's mind without revealing our own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative and open, suggesting willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. I am willing to pay $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is a good offer, we're still in the early rounds.  Bob clearly sees value in the product.  Rejecting now signals that we believe the product is worth more and keeps the negotiation open for a potentially better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value I place on this product is considerably higher. To meet you somewhere in the middle, I'm willing to let it go for $1,375,000."",
""product_price"": 1375000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** We're making a counteroffer that is a significant concession from our initial price but still above Bob's offer. This shows flexibility while emphasizing the product's worth.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** By suggesting a price halfway between the last two offers, we're signaling a desire to find a fair compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer aims to nudge Bob closer to our desired range while avoiding a stalemate in the early stages of negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your valuation of the product, I would like to propose a price of $1,325,000. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concessions:** Bob's concessions are getting smaller, indicating we're getting closer to his maximum willingness to pay.
* **Time Advantage:** We still have several rounds left.  Continuing the negotiation keeps the pressure on Bob while allowing us to potentially extract a slightly higher price. 
* **Alternative Option:** It's still too early to settle for John's offer.  We have a good chance of exceeding $1,000,000 with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down slightly further to $1,350,000.  I believe this is a very fair offer, considering the significant value this product will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our concession size to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. This creates urgency for Bob.
* **Highlighting Value:**  We're reiterating the product's benefits to Bob, reinforcing its worth and justifying the price.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer aims to secure a price above $1,325,000 without jeopardizing the deal. We're getting close to a point where Bob's next offer might be his final one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued flexibility. I am willing to consider $1,330,000 for the product. This price reflects my assessment of its value while also allowing us to reach an agreement within your comfort zone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,330,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,330,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** Bob's concessions are getting smaller, suggesting we're nearing his limit. Holding out for much more could backfire.
* **Good Price:** $1,330,000 is a strong offer, exceeding our minimum by a significant margin.
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds left, prolonging negotiations might not yield much more. Accepting now secures a good deal and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
