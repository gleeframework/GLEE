"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,400,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is unfortunately too low for me. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,200,000. This is a significant discount, and it's the best I can do at this point.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,200,000. I'm still a bit stretched at that price.  How about $1,100,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your situation, but $1,100,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000, but that's my absolute final offer. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference at $1,125,000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me. Let's try $1,140,000.  This is a small compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us. Let's get this deal done!",1140000.0,Alice,7,
