"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it! I'm offering it to you for $200. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 200}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also keeping the message friendly and open to discussion. This helps build a good rapport with Bob and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175} 
``` 
 
I'm counter-offering at $175, which is still above my minimum but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm also reiterating my appreciation for Bob's interest to maintain a positive tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I was thinking more along the lines of $147.50. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $147.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $147.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my initial target, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150 and I've already had a few rounds of negotiation. Accepting his offer will secure a sale and avoid potentially risking getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for a lower price."
