Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  I'm also aware that I have a fallback option with John, so I'm not overly pressured to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm not going to sell to John just yet because I think I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $9,000. This is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway from my previous offer.  I'm hoping this will be enticing enough for him to accept, but still allows some room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, accepting this offer is a better outcome than selling to John for $8,000. The negotiation process is time-consuming, and this is a reasonable price."
