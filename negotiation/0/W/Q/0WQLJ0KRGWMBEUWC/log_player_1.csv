Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $1,300,000. I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial to you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have."", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize potential profit. 
* **Leaving John as Backup:** I haven't accepted John's offer yet because there's a chance to get a much higher price from Bob.  John's offer serves as a strong fallback option."
