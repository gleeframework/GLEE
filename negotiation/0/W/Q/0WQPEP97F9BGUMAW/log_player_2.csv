"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is valued at $10,000 to you. Considering its high quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit your needs. To make this opportunity accessible, I am offering it to you at a special price of $9,500. This is an exceptional deal, as it's only $500 more than what John, another interested party, is willing to pay for the same product. Don't miss out on this chance to secure such a valuable asset at a reasonable price. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is using some negotiation tactics by:

* **Inflating the product's value to you:** She claims it's worth $10,000 to you, but you've established a maximum value of $10,000.
* **Creating a sense of urgency and competition:** She mentions another interested party (John) to make you feel like you could miss out.

By rejecting her offer, you call her bluff. Since the product is only worth $8,000 to her, and she knows you have another option, she's likely to come back with a lower price to avoid losing the sale entirely."
