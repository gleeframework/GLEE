Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you.  I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  It's a fair price considering the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price above my minimum of $10,000. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more.
* **Guaging Interest:** The message focuses on the value of the product to Bob, hoping to pique his interest and encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  By stating it's a ""fair price,"" I imply that I'm open to some negotiation, while still holding a strong starting position. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm keeping John in mind as a backup buyer, knowing I can always secure at least $10,000 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'd be willing to pay $10000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. While I could sell to John for the same amount, I'm not desperate.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  There's still room for negotiation. I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding a Loss:**  Selling to John at this point would be equivalent to losing out on the potential to earn more through further negotiations. 

I'll try to get a price closer to my initial offer of $15,000 by making a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $10,000 is my minimum, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $12,500? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still staying above my minimum price. 
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize that this price would be ""good for both of us,"" hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and encourage him to accept.
* **Strategic Position:** By meeting him ""halfway,"" I leave some room for further negotiation if needed, without sacrificing too much profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $11000? I think it's a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer of $11,000 is close to my desired price range, and significantly higher than what I could get from John. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Further negotiation might lead to a better price, but it also risks losing Bob as a buyer altogether.  
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Considering John's offer, accepting Bob's offer guarantees an extra $1000 compared to selling to John.  This profit is worth the slight reduction from my initial target.

I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure the sale and secure a good price for the product."
