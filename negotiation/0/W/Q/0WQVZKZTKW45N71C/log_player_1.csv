Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, but I'm open to discussing a price somewhere in between. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
