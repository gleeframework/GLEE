Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is $2,000 less than what John is willing to pay, but $2,000 more than what Bob is willing to pay. This maximizes your chances of selling to Bob while still getting a price higher than his maximum. If Bob rejects, you can still fall back on John."
