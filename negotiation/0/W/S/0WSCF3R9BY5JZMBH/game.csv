"Alice, your offer is quite high for my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can't afford $2000000. I'm willing to pay $1500000.  This is a fair price considering the product's potential value, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1500000 is below my minimum acceptable price.
