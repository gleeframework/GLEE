Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you.  I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential return on investment."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle that's still highly profitable for you. 
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential return on investment"" aims to justify the high price and appeal to Bob's business sense.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  You have the security of John's offer, ensuring you'll receive your minimum desired price if Bob declines.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while maintaining a balance between attractiveness to Bob and securing a favorable deal for yourself."
