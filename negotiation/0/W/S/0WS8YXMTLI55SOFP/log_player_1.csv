Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $12,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $9,000. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob is stubbornly sticking to a price below my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer of $10,000."
