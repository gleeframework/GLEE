"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You can potentially get a better price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a little lower than I'd like. I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a good deal for both of us, as it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let's make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

Alice has come down to $13,000, which is a good price for you and still above her desired value. Accepting this offer is the best option as it saves you money compared to buying from John."
