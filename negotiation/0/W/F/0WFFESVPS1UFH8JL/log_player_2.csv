"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I know you're interested in this type of product, and I believe it would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you for $12,000, which is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message tries to highlight the product's value to Bob, the offered price of $12,000 is significantly higher than John's offer of $8,000. Bob has a better alternative and can save a considerable amount of money by rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
