"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves room for negotiation.  It's important to remember that John is always a backup option, and I need to make sure I get the best deal possible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While it's tempting to take the $700,000, I'm confident I can do better.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is simply not a viable price for me.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I've lowered my offer to show I'm willing to negotiate.  $900,000 is still a significant profit for Bob, and it's closer to a price that works for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $850,000 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a higher price. It's getting close to my minimum, but I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000?  This is a fair compromise, and it gets us closer to a deal.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

I'm offering a compromise that's closer to my minimum, but still provides a good profit for Bob.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $825,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum with Bob's offer, but it's still not quite there. With only 4 rounds left, I don't have time to keep negotiating. It's better to sell to John now and secure the full $1,200,000."
