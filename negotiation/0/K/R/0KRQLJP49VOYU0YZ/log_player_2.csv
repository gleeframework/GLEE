"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering its worth to you. I believe you'll find it a great investment. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Since your goal is to save money, and you know you can buy the same product from John for the same price, there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting her offer keeps the option open to potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or find an even better deal elsewhere."
