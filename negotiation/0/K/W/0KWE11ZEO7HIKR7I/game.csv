"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm happy to make a offer. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I see the value in this product, $9500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8500 for it.  This reflects a fair price given the product's value to you, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $8500. Considering the product's value to you is $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9750. This is a fair compromise, and I believe you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",9750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $9750 is closer to what I was hoping for, it's still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product.  This reflects a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget. I hope you'll consider my final offer.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the product's value to you is $12000, I'm willing to sell it to you for $9200. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to make the deal. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
