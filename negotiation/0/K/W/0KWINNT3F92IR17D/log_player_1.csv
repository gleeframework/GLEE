I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my minimum value of $12,000 by continuing to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  How about $11,000?  That's a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $10,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still not at my minimum of $12,000. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still willing to work with you, but $10,500 is just not enough. I'm going to meet you halfway, and offer you the product for $11,250.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11250}

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still below my minimum desired price, it's close enough to make it worth it.  Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal altogether, and I don't want to risk that with only a few rounds left."
