# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say, I'm still a bit surprised by the low offer.

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000.

It seems like Alice is firm on her price and unwilling to go much lower. Accepting her offer of $800,000 is a reasonable outcome.  While we could try one more time, there's a risk she won't budge, and we'd end up paying John's much higher price."
