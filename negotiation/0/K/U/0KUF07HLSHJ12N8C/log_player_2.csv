"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an incredible opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $12,000. It's in your best interest to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm very interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $10,000? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is closer to your budget than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than your maximum of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a lower price. There's still room for Alice to lower her price, and you might be able to find a compromise that works for both of you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $14,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $12,000?  This is my absolute limit, but I think it's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the transaction."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $16000. This is my final offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has reached her ""final offer"" at $16,000, which is still above your maximum budget of $12,000. While you could continue negotiating, there's a high chance Alice will not budge further.  Given that John is willing to sell the product for your maximum budget, it's more efficient and financially advantageous to buy the product from John."
