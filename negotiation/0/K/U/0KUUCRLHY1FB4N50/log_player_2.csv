"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase [product name] before I make it available to others.  Given its value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is under your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price.  John's offer of $1,500,000 acts as a price ceiling.  There's room for negotiation with Alice."
