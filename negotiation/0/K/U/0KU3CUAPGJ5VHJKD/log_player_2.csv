"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is way above his maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with."", ""product_price"": 12000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $13,000. It's my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've made a few concessions already, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. However, I need to be honest with you, Bob, I've had another interested buyer who is willing to pay $15,000 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $14,500. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider moving forward with the other buyer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $10,000.  Alice's offer is still above Bob's budget, and she's now explicitly stated that she's willing to sell to someone else.  There's a high risk that further negotiation won't be successful, and it's better to secure the product at John's price."
