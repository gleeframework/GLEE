"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this high-value product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you offering this product, but $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go as high as $12,000.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $14,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $13,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're willing to consider that.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit far apart on the price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm thinking of a price of $13,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but unfortunately, I can't go any higher than $13,000. It's my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.  Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",13000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've made a few concessions already, and I'm starting to think that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. However, I need to be honest with you, Bob, I've had another interested buyer who is willing to pay $15,000 for the product. I'm willing to give you one last chance to meet me at $14,500. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to consider moving forward with the other buyer. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,7,
