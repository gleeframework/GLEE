Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $9,500. I know it's valuable to you, and this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $10,000 (Bob's perceived value) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, and you can potentially meet in the middle. 
* **Alternative Exists:** Knowing you have John as a backup at $8,000 gives you leverage to aim higher with Bob.

By starting at $9,500, you create a strong position for negotiation while ensuring you don't scare Bob away with an unreasonably high initial price."
