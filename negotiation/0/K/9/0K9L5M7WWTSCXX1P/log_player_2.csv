"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting price is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for offering!  While I like the product, $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and appreciative:** Starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing interest.
* **Direct about budget:** Clearly states that $120 is out of the question.
* **Opens negotiation:**  Suggests a significantly lower price ($60) to see how much Alice is willing to move. 

This strategy aims to bring the price closer to my $80 maximum while leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. How about we meet at $90? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $90 is still above your $80 limit. There's room for one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we split the difference and settle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the reasoning behind this counteroffer:

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  ""I appreciate you coming down"" shows Alice I recognize and appreciate her move towards a compromise.
* **Compromise Proposal:**  ""Split the difference"" is a common and understandable negotiation tactic, aiming for a price that feels fair to both parties. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** $75 puts us just below my $80 maximum, giving me some wiggle room if Alice counteroffers again. 

This continues the negotiation with a reasonable counteroffer that keeps me in a good position to get the best possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to compromise a bit more. How about we meet at $82.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and $82.50 exceeds your $80 maximum budget. It's time to cut your losses and go with John's guaranteed offer."
