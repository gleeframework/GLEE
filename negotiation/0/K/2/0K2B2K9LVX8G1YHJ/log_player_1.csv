"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. I'm also emphasizing the benefits of the product to encourage him to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  While I'm happy to negotiate, I'm not willing to sell for a price that significantly undervalues the product.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $11,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Given my budget, I am comfortable with a price of $11,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer.  I'm willing to accept his offer as I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely and ending up with nothing.  There's also a chance that if I reject this offer, Bob might not counteroffer again, leaving me with only the option to sell to John for $15,000.  It's a calculated risk, but I'm going to take it and close this deal."
