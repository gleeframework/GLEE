"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $100.  I know you'll find it valuable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:** Buying from Alice for $100 is cheaper than buying from John for $120. 
* **It's a good deal for Bob:** While $100 is more than the product is worth to Alice ($80), it's still less than the maximum Bob is willing to pay ($120)."
