"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high. You are willing to pay up to $800,000, so rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best option to try and negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $800,000 for the product. This counteroffer directly reflects your limit and puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to your price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still significantly higher than your desired price of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate could potentially result in a better price.  There's still room for negotiation, and you haven't lost anything by rejecting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've already rejected Alice's offer of $1,100,000, showing your willingness to walk away.  A counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise -  it's closer to Alice's last offer but still within your budget. This demonstrates your commitment to reaching a deal while maintaining a firm stance on your price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above your maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's closer to your price range, you can still potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially leads to a more favorable price for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

You've shown Alice you're serious about getting a good deal, and she's lowered her price.  By offering $950,000, you're splitting the difference between her last offer and your previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility while still staying within your budget.  It's likely Alice will see this as a reasonable compromise and potentially accept the offer."
