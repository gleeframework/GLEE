Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Offers a fair price:** It's below Bob's perceived value but above my minimum requirement.
* **Is clear and concise:** It directly states the offer and provides a reason for Bob to accept. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It acknowledges the potential for a counteroffer.

I'm confident that I can get a better price than $8,000 from John, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price of $12,000 with Bob."
