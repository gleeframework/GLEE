Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $20,000."", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $18,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $18,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet in the middle at $19,000?"", ""product_price"": 19000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still think $19,000 is a bit high. Would you be willing to consider a price of $17,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $17,500

``` 
This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Profitable:** $17,500 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Continuing to negotiate risks Bob walking away entirely. John offers a safety net but at a lower profit. Accepting now secures a good deal."
