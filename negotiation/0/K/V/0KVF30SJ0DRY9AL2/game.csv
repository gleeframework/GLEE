"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is significantly below my minimum price for this unique product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17500? This is a fair price given the product's value and your interest.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $17500 is still above my budget, I am willing to consider $15000 as a compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",15000.0,Bob,4,
