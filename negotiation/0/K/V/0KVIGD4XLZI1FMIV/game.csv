"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. That price is quite high for me. I'm thinking more in the range of  $600,000.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product's unique capabilities and potential return on investment. To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price point reflects the true value of what's being offered.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but we are still quite far apart.  To be honest, I can get a similar product elsewhere for considerably less.  To keep our conversation going,  I could go as high as $700,000.  Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're exploring different options, but I'm confident you won't find this level of quality and potential elsewhere. I'm willing to make a significant move and lower the price to $1,800,000. This offer reflects my strong desire to make this deal work, but I need you to meet me closer to that value.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, to be totally transparent,  anything much above $800,000 just doesn't make sense for me.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I also have budget limitations.  If you can come down to that figure, I'm ready to close the deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget. It seems we're at an impasse. I'm willing to make one final offer: $1,500,000. This is the lowest I can go, as it's the absolute minimum I can accept for this product. I believe it's a fair deal considering its true value and potential.  Let me know your decision - I'm hoping we can make this work.",1500000.0,Alice,7,
