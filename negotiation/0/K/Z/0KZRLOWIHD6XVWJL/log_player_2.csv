"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting close, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $11,100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $11,100 and my previous offer of $11,800. My revised offer is $11,450. I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.

We're in round 9 and Alice is clearly sticking to a price above $11,000.  While we could try one more counteroffer, we risk her walking away and then we'd have to buy from John at $15,000. Accepting $11,450 secures a decent deal and avoids that risk."
