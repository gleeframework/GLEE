Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,000. This is a limited-time offer, so don't miss out!"", 
""product_price"": 11000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $11,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you're still securing your minimum price with John."
