"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $11,500. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on this valuable item at a discounted rate. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $11,500 is lower than your maximum price, you can do better. You know John will sell it to you for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or still buy it from John for less than Alice's current offer."
