"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for this product.  I believe this price is still fair given its potential value. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is considerably below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This price reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,800,000, but it's still a bit out of my range.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $1,500,000. This price is fair considering the value you've put on the product and my maximum budget. I'm hoping we can finalize this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
