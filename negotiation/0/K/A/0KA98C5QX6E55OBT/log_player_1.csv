Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $11,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than what Bob is willing to pay but still lower than my minimum price.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, highlighting the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer.

**Strategy:**

* By offering $11,000, I'm leaving room for negotiation but still ensuring I get a decent profit. 
*  If Bob rejects, I'll evaluate his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or counter again. 
*  If the negotiations stall, I can always go to John for my guaranteed $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product.  It's my maximum budget, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is below my minimum price of $12,000. While it's tempting to take his $10,000 offer, it's not worth sacrificing the potential for a better deal. 

**Strategy:**

* I'll reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This will keep the negotiations going and potentially lead to a more favorable outcome. 
* I'll also need to consider if the risk of Bob walking away completely is worth the potential gain of a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $10,000. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to sell for $10,500. It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $10,500, which is a compromise. It's halfway between my previous offer of $11,000 and Bob's offer of $10,000.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints while still emphasizing the value of the product and the fairness of my counteroffer. I'm also using persuasive language (""great deal"") to encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* This counteroffer shows flexibility while still trying to maximize my profit.
* If Bob rejects again, I'll need to assess whether to further lower my price or go to John for the guaranteed $12,000.  
* I'm also keeping in mind that Bob might be willing to negotiate further, as he's already shown interest in the product."
