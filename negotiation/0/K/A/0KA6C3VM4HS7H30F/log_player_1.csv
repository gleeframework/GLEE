Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $20,000. I believe it holds significant value, and this is a competitive price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we have a guaranteed offer of $15,000 from John. It makes sense to start with a price higher than both. 
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $20,000 leaves room for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we can always come down slightly while still remaining above our guaranteed price.
* **Confident Presentation:** The message frames the offer as a valuable opportunity and presents the price confidently, which might influence Bob's perception of the product's worth. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Risk Tolerance:**  We don't know how likely Bob is to negotiate or walk away. A very risk-averse Bob might reject the initial high price.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If there's a time constraint to selling the product, we might adjust our strategy to be more aggressive or accommodating."
