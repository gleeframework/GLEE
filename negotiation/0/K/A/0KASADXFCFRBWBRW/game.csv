"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $850000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable considering the product's value to you and my minimum selling price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're looking to make a profit, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $775000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm thinking of a counteroffer of $825000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",825000.0,Alice,5,
