Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product which I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its unique benefits, I'm proposing a price of $14,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price of $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a little space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price.
* **Strong but Fair:**  The message positions the price as justified due to the product's value while still acknowledging Bob's potential interest. 

By aiming high but staying within a reasonable range, you increase your chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
