"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

Although $135 is getting closer to my limit, I should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $135 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $100?"",
""product_price"": 100

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $115?  That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice meeting in the middle at $115 is a good deal. It saves me $5 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
