Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal, and I'm confident it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to start high to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still being well above my minimum.
* **Confident but not aggressive tone:** The message aims to convey the product's value without being pushy.  

By setting the initial price high, I increase the chance of securing a deal that's significantly more profitable than my backup option with John."
