{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

I'm going to sell the product to John.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is tempting, it's still not quite where I want to be.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees me a good profit and avoids any further risk of haggling with Bob."
