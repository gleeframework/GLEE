{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before anyone else. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $120. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he would be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80 from the sale.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Offering the product at $120 gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing you to make a substantial profit ($40).  This price is likely to entice Bob while maximizing your potential earnings. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, so there's no risk of losing out completely if Bob declines."
