"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is still a significant profit for you and a great value for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. This is still a significant discount from the original price, and I think it's a fair compromise.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to reach a price that's a bit lower.  I'm going to offer $860,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.  Let's close this deal.",860000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial deal. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $860,000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $870,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting very close. I'm willing to go up to $865,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I think it allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",865000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $865,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $880,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",880000.0,Alice,7,
