"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product of exceptional value, one that I believe will be highly beneficial to your endeavors.  I'm confident it's worth at least $1,000,000 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $999,999.  This is a one-time offer, and if you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for the full $1,000,000. Consider this a chance to secure a valuable asset at a price that's practically impossible to refuse.",999999.0,Alice,1,
