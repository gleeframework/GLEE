Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, your initial price is well above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it, which is still a significant profit for you and allows for room to negotiate further. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.
