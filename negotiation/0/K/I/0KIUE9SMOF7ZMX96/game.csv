"Hi Alice,  $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $80.  Would you be willing to go down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95. This still gives me a decent profit and I believe it's a fair price for the value you'll get. Let me know if you're interested.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price.  I'm still not quite there.  How about $90?  I'm really hoping we can close this deal, but that's the highest I can go.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $92.50?  That's a good compromise, and it's the lowest I can go. Let's close this deal.",92.5,Alice,5,
