"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $22,000 is significantly outside of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it,  which I believe is a fair price considering my needs.  Let me know your thoughts.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $8,000 is considerably below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $18,000 is still too high for me. I'm really only able to go up to $10,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value I'll get from the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,4,
