Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $18,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best strategy at this stage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is aiming to get the product for as close to his maximum budget as possible. A counteroffer of $13,000 represents a significant discount from Alice's initial offer.  This price is still within the realm of plausibility, leaving room for negotiation and potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $16,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit.  Rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate presents a chance to potentially get an even lower price. There are still 7 rounds remaining, allowing for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his maximum budget. This counteroffer of $14,500  is a compromise, showing willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price as close to $15,000 as possible. It's a reasonable middle ground that could potentially entice Alice to accept."
