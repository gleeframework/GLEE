"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $22,000 is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is lower than her initial price, it's still well above your budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can get closer to your desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and your own stated value for the product, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, $10,000 is still quite low.  I'd be willing to accept $14,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still above my budget.  Although it's a significant compromise on her end, it's not enough for me.  I'm better off buying from John for $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and don't risk further negotiation that might push the price even higher."
