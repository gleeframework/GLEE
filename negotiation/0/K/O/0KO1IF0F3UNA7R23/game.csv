"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product, which is still a good price for you considering its worth to you. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate, but $18,000 is still too high for me. Given my budget and your own stated value for the product, I'm willing to offer $10,000. This allows for a good profit for you while staying within my budget. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, $10,000 is still quite low.  I'd be willing to accept $14,000, which is a significant compromise on my end.  This offer reflects the true value of the product.  What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,5,
