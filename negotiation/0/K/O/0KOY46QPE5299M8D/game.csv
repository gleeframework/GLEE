"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the range of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm happy to work with you, $1200000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1350000?  This is a fair price that recognizes your needs and my investment in this product. Let's find a way to make this work for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. This still allows for a reasonable return on your investment while staying within my financial limits. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
