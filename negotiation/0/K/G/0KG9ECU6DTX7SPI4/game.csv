"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $950,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This is a good price for both of us and avoids any further haggling. What do you think?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $925,000. This is a great deal, and I think it's worth considering. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
