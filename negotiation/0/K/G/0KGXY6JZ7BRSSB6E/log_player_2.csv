"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point. We're aiming to save money, and rejecting the offer allows us to potentially negotiate a lower price. We have 10 rounds and a fallback option of buying from John for the same price, so we're in a good position to see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate. A 25% reduction is a substantial amount, but it gives us room to compromise throughout the remaining rounds. This aggressive approach shows Alice we're serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than our desired target. We have more rounds to negotiate and can potentially push for a better price. There's no need to rush into an agreement, especially since we have the alternative of buying from John at the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our counteroffer slightly to $950,000.  This shows Alice that we are willing to compromise, while still aiming for a significant saving.  It's a middle ground between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, and it might encourage her to come closer to our desired price.  We still have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, so there's no need to rush a deal yet."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, we are still aiming for a lower price.  We have more rounds left and a backup option at the same price.  There's no urgency to accept the offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're increasing our offer to $1,000,000. This is a compromise, showing Alice we're serious about buying but also that we're not willing to give in completely. We're getting closer to her last offer, and hopefully, this will prompt her to meet us in the middle. We have 4 rounds left, so we have some room to continue negotiating if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,020,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to our desired price range.  We only have 3 rounds left.  While we could try to get a slightly better price, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to negotiate and we'll be left with the same price from John.  It's a good deal, and it's better to accept the offer rather than risk losing the opportunity to buy at a favorable price."
