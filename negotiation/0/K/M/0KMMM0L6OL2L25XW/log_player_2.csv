"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. That's a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.
