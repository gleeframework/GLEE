"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product. This is a one-time opportunity, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is better than the initial $1,500,000 value, it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He can get the product from John for a lower price, so rejecting Alice's offer is the most financially sensible choice."
