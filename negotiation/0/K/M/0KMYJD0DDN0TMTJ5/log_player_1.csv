Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value to give myself room to negotiate. However, it's still lower than my minimum price, leaving space for counteroffers without losing too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $125. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'd prefer to sell to him, I'm not willing to go below my minimum price of $150. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
