"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm compensated fairly for the value of this product.  How about $10,500?  That leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  That seems like a fair deal for both of us.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but $9,250 is still too far below my minimum.  Let's split the difference and go with $9,750. This would be a great deal for both of us and ensure a smooth transaction.",9750.0,Alice,5,
