"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her estimated value of the product ($900,000 vs. $800,000). There's definitely room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $800,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $825,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product is worth $1,500,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $825,000 is still a good deal for Bob, considering the product's value to him is $1,500,000.  While further negotiation could potentially bring the price down, it's unlikely that Alice will go much lower, and continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether. Accepting the offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price that's significantly lower than buying from John, while still leaving room for profit."
