"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a product that is worth $1,500,000 to you, and I believe this price is a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering you value it at $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
