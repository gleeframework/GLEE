Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, given your specific needs and goals. I'm initially offering it at $1,900,000. Please let me know your thoughts, and we can certainly discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you have room to start high. This allows for potential negotiation downward while still securing a profit beyond your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, potentially making him more willing to accept a higher price.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrasing ""initially offering"" and ""discuss further"" signals flexibility and invites Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Goal:** This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob, capitalizing on his potential higher valuation while also having the safety net of John's offer."
