"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save as much as possible. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is still a good amount, I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,050,000. This reflects the product's unique value and the potential we both see in it. Let's find a compromise that works for us both."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you mentioned and the market price. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,025,000 is a solid deal considering the product's value and Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's better than selling to John for $1,000,000 and also leaves room for potential future collaborations with Bob."
