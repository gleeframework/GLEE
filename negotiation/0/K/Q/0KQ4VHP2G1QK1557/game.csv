"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer. I'd like to propose a price of $10000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $11500. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value to be worth it. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $11000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'm proposing a price of $11750. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find the product's value to be worth it. What do you think?",11750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go above $11000. I'm willing to make one final offer: I'll meet you at $11000, and that's my absolute limit. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $15000.",11000.0,Bob,6,
