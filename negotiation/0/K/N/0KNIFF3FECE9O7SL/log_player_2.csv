"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am excited to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire our flagship product, which holds immense value to us at $1,000,000. Given its significance and the potential it offers for you, I believe we can find a mutually beneficial arrangement.

To make this offer more appealing, I propose a price of $950,000 for the product. This price not only reflects its true worth but also allows for a fair transaction, considering the investment you are making into this valuable asset. If you are interested in discussing further details or exploring any special conditions that could make this deal even more attractive to you, please let me know.

Thank you for considering this proposal. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Alice 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product.  Alice's offer of $950,000 is better than buying from John, but you can still do better.  By rejecting her offer, you can potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from another seller in the future."
