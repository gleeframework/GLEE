"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still not there yet with $1,150,000. How about $1,050,000? It's a good compromise and closer to the value I see in the product. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer, but the gap is still significant. To show my willingness to make a deal, I'll come down to $1,125,000.  However, I need to see a more substantial move from your end to justify going any lower.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, and I'm willing to go a bit higher. How about $1,100,000? This is a good compromise that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product. Let's make this deal happen.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
