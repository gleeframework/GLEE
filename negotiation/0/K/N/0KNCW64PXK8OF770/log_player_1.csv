"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, he might be willing to pay a little extra to secure it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,300,000. This is a significant decrease from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.  Hopefully, this will be more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $1,250,000.  This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but I'm trying to be more realistic about Bob's willingness to pay while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tricky situation. Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum, and I could sell to John for the same amount. However, there are a couple of things to consider:

* **Time:** I'm already in round 6. If I keep rejecting offers, I risk running out of time. 
* **Potential Counteroffer:** There's a chance Bob might increase his offer if I reject him.  However, there's also a chance he might walk away.

Considering the risk of losing the deal, I'm going to **accept Bob's offer** and secure the sale. It's the best outcome given the current circumstances."
