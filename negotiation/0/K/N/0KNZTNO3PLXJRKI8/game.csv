"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $8500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be closer to $9000 to make this work.  Remember, you mentioned you're willing to pay a premium for this product, and $9000 reflects that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
