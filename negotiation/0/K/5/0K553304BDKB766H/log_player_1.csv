Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this product for $1,100,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay significantly more than your minimum.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high (but below Bob's maximum) leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:** Offering a price too close to $1,200,000 could make Bob feel cheated and less likely to accept. This price still allows him a significant gain.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at your minimum acceptable price."
