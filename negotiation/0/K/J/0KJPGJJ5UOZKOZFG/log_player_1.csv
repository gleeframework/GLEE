Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we want to aim higher since we have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, closer to his perceived value while still exceeding John's offer. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:** By mentioning listing the product publicly, we subtly imply that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act soon. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
