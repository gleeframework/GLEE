Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000, but leaves room for negotiation and is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob while also setting a clear expectation for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to maximize my profit while maintaining a reasonable chance of Bob accepting the offer. By starting high, I leave room for negotiation while also establishing a strong starting point.  I'm prepared to counter-offer if necessary, but I also have the option of selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay $950000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm confident I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price, aiming to secure a higher price while maintaining a reasonable chance of reaching an agreement.  It's important to remember that selling to John guarantees $1,200,000, but I want to explore all options before resorting to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something closer to $1,100,000.  It's still a great value for you considering the product's benefits. Let's find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased the price from $1,000,000 to $1,100,000. This counteroffer is closer to my desired price point, while still being negotiable. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the potential benefits for Bob, while also setting a clear expectation for the next negotiation round.

**Strategy:**

By increasing the price, I'm showing Bob that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product.  However, I'm still keeping the offer open for negotiation, hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us. I'm prepared to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John if the negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to consider an offer closer to $1050000. This still allows me to save some money compared to its value to me, while providing a fair price for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still determined to push for a higher price. I believe there's room for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $1,150,000. It's important to be firm but also open to finding a middle ground. I'm confident that I can get a better deal, but I also need to be mindful of the risk of Bob walking away or me needing to sell to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm happy to meet you halfway, but I'm still looking for $1,125,000 for the product. It's a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's finalize this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've increased the price from $1,100,000 to $1,125,000. This is a small increment, showing flexibility while still staying within my desired range. 
* **Message:** The message is positive and emphasizes the fairness of the offer, while also urging Bob to reach a final agreement. 

**Strategy:**

By making a smaller counteroffer, I'm signaling that I'm willing to be flexible, but also staying firm on my desire for a higher price.  This approach aims to push Bob closer to my target price while also increasing the likelihood of a deal being struck. If this offer is rejected, I'll need to decide whether to further negotiate or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I am willing to pay $1075000 for the product. This allows me to save some money while still being fair to you. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,075,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  While I've been successful in pushing the price higher, it seems unlikely that we'll reach a mutually agreeable price through further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell to John. This guarantees me the highest possible price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation failures.  While I would have preferred to sell to Bob at a higher price, the certainty of John's offer outweighs the potential of continued negotiation with Bob."
