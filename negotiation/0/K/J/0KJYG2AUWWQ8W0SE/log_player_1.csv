"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits you'll gain from it."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. I am willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is still significantly below its value to him and there's plenty of room for negotiation. We're aiming higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but my initial offer already factored in a considerable margin for negotiation.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

Here's the strategy:

* **Strong Stance:** By stating this is our final offer, we create a sense of urgency and importance.
* **Slight Concession:**  We've made a small concession to show flexibility but are holding firm on a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:** We're reminding Bob about the fairness and value of the product to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,075,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

We're getting closer, but we're still leaving a significant amount of potential profit on the table. Bob's latest offer shows he's willing to move, so we'll push a bit further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'll meet you halfway. Let's settle at $1,087,500. This offer stands until the end of the next round, as I need to make a decision about other potential buyers soon."",
""product_price"": 1087500
}
```

Here's the breakdown:

* **Compromise:** We're demonstrating a willingness to compromise by meeting Bob precisely in the middle of the previous offers.
* **Time Pressure:** We're introducing a mild time constraint to encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially prevent this negotiation from dragging on.
* **Implied Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other potential buyers"" reminds Bob that we have options and this deal isn't open-ended."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my needs. I am willing to pay $1,070,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to our acceptable range, we're still in a strong position. We've set a deadline for our previous offer, and he's clearly still interested. It's time to hold firm and see if he's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, my offer of $1,087,500 still stands, but only until the end of this round.  I need a decision from you now.  The value this product offers is undeniable, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1087500
}
```

Here's why this approach makes sense:

* **Finality:**  We're reiterating that our previous offer was a firm deadline. This creates strong pressure for Bob to make a decision now.
* **Confidence:**  We're reiterating our belief in the product's value, subtly reminding Bob that he's the one who stands to lose out on a good deal.
* **No Further Concessions:** We've already made compromises. By holding firm at this price, we're signaling we're not willing to go lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your offers and the value of the product. I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

It's time to close the deal.  Bob is clearly trying to maximize his value, and we've reached a price point that's significantly above our minimum. Holding out for more at this stage could risk losing the deal altogether.  Accepting $1,075,000 ensures a substantial profit."
