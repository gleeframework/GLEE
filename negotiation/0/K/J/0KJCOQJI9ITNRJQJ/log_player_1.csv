"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially suggesting a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a discussion."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm aiming high to establish a strong bargaining position. While this price is above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and signals the product's worth to me. 
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes this is a ""starting point"" and I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Alternative buyer (John):** Having John as a backup provides a strong safety net, allowing me to confidently negotiate for a higher price with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, your initial asking price is quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I need a more reasonable starting point. How about we consider a price closer to $800,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum ($1,200,000) and his own stated value ($1,000,000).  While I want to negotiate, accepting this offer would be a substantial loss. It's clear we have room to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective. However, $800,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I'm making a substantial drop from my initial offer ($200,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate and find a compromise. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** This counteroffer keeps me well above my $1,200,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""market value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the price to a higher point, even if this is based on my own assessment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a more agreeable price. However, $1,400,000 is still a significant leap from my initial offer.  To be realistic, I'm thinking closer to $950,000. This demonstrates my serious interest while recognizing the need for a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is increasing, it's still too far from my minimum. I need to signal that I'm willing to walk away if we can't find a price point that works for both of us. John provides me with that safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about this purchase, and I respect that. However, the value of this product is firmly above $1,000,000.  I'm willing to consider $1,250,000 as my final offer. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm tone by stating this is my final offer while still aiming for a price that is mutually beneficial.
* **Close to My Minimum:**  This offer is only slightly above my absolute minimum, but I'm hoping that by framing it as my final offer and highlighting the compromise, Bob will be more inclined to accept. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiation rounds, and I need to apply more pressure to reach a decision."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to negotiate is appreciated, but $1,250,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for this product. This represents my absolute limit, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable offer considering the market value and my own financial considerations. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now reached his stated value for the product, $1,000,000. While it's less than my ideal price and below John's offer, it's crucial to consider the following:

* **Negotiation Dynamics:** Continuing to push might make Bob walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **Time Value of Money:**  A deal today is worth more than a potential deal later. Accepting John's offer means waiting and potentially dealing with delays or complications.
* **Profitable Outcome:** While not ideal, $1,000,000 is still a significant profit. It's essential to recognize a good deal, even if it isn't perfect. 

Accepting Bob's offer ensures a guaranteed sale at a respectable price."
