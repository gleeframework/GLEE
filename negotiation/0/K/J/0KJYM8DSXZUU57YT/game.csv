"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the original price I had in mind.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below a million.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your target price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer it to you for $975,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me and the original price I had in mind.",975000.0,Alice,5,
