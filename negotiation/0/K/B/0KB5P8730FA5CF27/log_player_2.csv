"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you do $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We want to create room for negotiation.  Starting significantly lower than our true maximum ($100) gives us space to bargain upward if needed.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By offering $85, we give Alice room to counter with a price closer to our target while still potentially making a profit.

This strategy aims to secure the best possible deal while acknowledging the value of the product to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $110 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $95. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is moving closer to a price we'd consider, we're still aiming for the best possible deal.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're looking for a price closer to our $85 counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $90? That seems like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Alice has come down from $110 to $95.  By countering with $90, we're showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price. 
* **Clear Target:**  This offer makes it clear that we're targeting a price in the low 90s. It gives Alice a chance to accept a price that still earns her a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm willing to consider your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $92. It's still a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm trying to find a middle ground. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $92 is a very reasonable price, saving us $8 compared to John's offer and significantly less than Alice's initial offer.
* **Limited Time:**  We're past the halfway point in the negotiation. Continuing to push for a slightly lower price might backfire, causing Alice to become less willing to negotiate or us running out of rounds. 

It's better to secure a good deal now than risk missing out on the savings."
