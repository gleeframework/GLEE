Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $700,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value considering the product's worth to you and the potential returns it can bring to your business. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000. Since you can get the product for $800,000 from John, it's in your best interest to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
