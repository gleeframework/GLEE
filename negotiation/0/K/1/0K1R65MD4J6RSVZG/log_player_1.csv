Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $18,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your desired price, leaving room for bargaining. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's reaction to this initial high price will give me valuable information about his level of interest and flexibility. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer at $10,000, so I'm willing to be bold with my initial offer to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a decent offer, I started high for a reason.  There's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum but still above John's offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob. While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me at $15,000?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims for a price point between my initial ask and Bob's offer, encouraging compromise.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $15,000 is still a significant profit margin above my $10,000 minimum, and it leaves some wiggle room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining Value:** I don't want to drop my price too drastically, as it could undervalue the product in Bob's eyes."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $15,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $13,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Solid Profit:** $13,500 is a good deal. It's a substantial profit above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Meeting Halfway:**  Bob's willingness to meet in the middle signals he's serious about purchasing the product.
* **Avoiding Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could push Bob away. Accepting this offer secures a good deal and avoids the risk of him walking away."
