"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I can't go as low as $10,500, I'm willing to compromise. How about $13,500?  That's still a fair price for both of us, and allows me to make a good deal on this amazing product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm happy to meet you halfway, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $14,000?  It's a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with this product.",14000.0,Alice,5,
