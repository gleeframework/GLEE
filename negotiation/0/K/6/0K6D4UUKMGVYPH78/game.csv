"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great value at this price.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,250,000. Let's work together to bridge the gap.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
