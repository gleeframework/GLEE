"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product and my budget. Can you consider this offer?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $925000. This is a compromise that I believe is still a great value for the product, and I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $875000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Can you consider this offer?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a bit of wiggle room, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $900000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $900000. I'm willing to make one last offer of $880000. This is my final price, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this point.",880000.0,Bob,6,
