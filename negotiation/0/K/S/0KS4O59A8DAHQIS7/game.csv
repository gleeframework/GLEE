"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $160. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. I can offer it to you for $155. It's the highest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair deal considering the product's value.",155.0,Alice,7,
