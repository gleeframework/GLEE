"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you offering this product. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. Given my own assessment of its value, I'm willing to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but the gap between $850,000 and my valuation is substantial. This product offers significant untapped potential, which my initial offer reflects. To move forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while acknowledging the inherent value of what's on the table."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,025,000 is still too high for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer $950,000. This price reflects a significant increase from my previous offer and a good starting point for continued negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below our minimum. We're willing to negotiate, but we also need to signal that our valuation is serious. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open while pushing Bob to make a more substantial move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. To show I'm serious about finding a solution, I'm willing to accept a compromise.  My final offer is $975,000. This represents a significant reduction on my part and acknowledges your willingness to negotiate. Let's close this deal."",
""product_price"": 975000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  At this point, it's strategic to signal a degree of finality while still offering a price slightly above Bob's last offer. This puts the pressure on Bob to either accept a reasonable deal or significantly increase his offer to keep the negotiation alive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still slightly above my comfort zone.  To finalize this deal, I'm offering $925,000. This is a fair and realistic price that reflects both of our perspectives. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to significantly increase his offer.  He's sticking close to his original valuation and hasn't shown a willingness to meet closer to our price point. Accepting his offer would mean a substantial loss compared to John's standing offer. It's time to cut our losses and secure the guaranteed deal with John."
