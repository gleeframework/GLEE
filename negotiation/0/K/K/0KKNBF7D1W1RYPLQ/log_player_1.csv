I'm starting with a price of $150. This is higher than my minimum, but leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm counteroffering at $135. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would prefer a slightly higher price,  $125 is significantly better than selling to John for $100.  It's important to balance potential profit with the risk of losing the deal entirely."
