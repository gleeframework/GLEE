"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. It's worth $1,200,000 to me, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $1,150,000? This would allow me to make a more feasible decision.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,150,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know if this works for you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,250,000 is slightly out of my current budget. I would like to propose $1,200,000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
