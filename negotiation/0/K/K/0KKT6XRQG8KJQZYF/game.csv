"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree it's a great product, $18,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair price.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $16,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product brings to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $13,500? That's a reasonable compromise, I think.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 might still be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. However, I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $15,500. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, this is getting pretty close to what I can do.  I'd be willing to pay $14,500 to get this done today.  What do you say?",14500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. I'm willing to meet you at $15,000, which is the price I was initially willing to accept from John. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",15000.0,Alice,7,
