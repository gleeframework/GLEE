"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $9,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This gives us both a good deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $10,500 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference again and settle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
