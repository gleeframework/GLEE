"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $180. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $180 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'd be happy to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a low offer, knowing Alice is likely to reject it. This establishes my budget and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand your budget constraints, but $180 is already a significant discount on my end. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a great deal for a product you'll love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is closer to my budget, it's still above my desired price point.  I'm going to reject and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $140 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from my initial $100, showing I'm willing to compromise. $120 is a good middle ground, and hopefully, Alice will see it as a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $140 is about as low as I can go.  I'm confident you won't find a better deal on a product like this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on her price of $140, which is still higher than my desired price point.  Rather than continue negotiating and risking losing time, I'll go with the guaranteed deal from John at $100."
