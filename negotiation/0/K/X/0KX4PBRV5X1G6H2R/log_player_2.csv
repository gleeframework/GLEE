"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you and still a substantial profit for me. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a better price than John's, there's still room for negotiation to get an even better deal.  Bob can make a counteroffer and try to get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better price.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it ensures a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work together to finalize this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,100,000 is a good deal for Bob.  It's still significantly less than what he'd pay John ($1,500,000) and allows Bob to save $100,000.  While there might be a slight chance of getting an even lower price with further negotiation, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay John's price outweighs the potential savings."
