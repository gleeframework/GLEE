"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal for a product that's worth $10,000 to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum acceptable value ($15,000) but still within the range that Bob might be willing to pay, considering his value of $10,000.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm highlighting the value proposition for Bob to make the offer more enticing.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiating further, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. It's still a good price for a product that's worth $15,000 to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $12,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **More rounds available:** I have more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can secure a better price.
* **Potential for counter-offer:** I can use this round to counteroffer and potentially reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Risk assessment:** While selling to John for $15,000 is a safe option, I want to maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This price is still a great value for you, considering the product's worth to you. Let's try to find a compromise here."", ""product_price"": 16000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm counter-offering with a price higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. My message explains the rationale behind the counter-offer, focusing on the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Focus on compromise:** I'm emphasizing the need for compromise and a mutually beneficial outcome to encourage further negotiation.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not dropping my price too drastically, as I want to ensure a good return on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway, Alice. I'll pay $13,500 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $13,500 is below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. 
* **Limited rounds remaining:** While I'm willing to negotiate, I have only 6 rounds left, and I want to maximize my potential profit.
* **Potential for higher counteroffer:** I believe I can push Bob closer to my desired price point with a counteroffer.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** I can always sell to John for $15,000 if I don't reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  I'm confident this price is fair for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm counter-offering with a price that is halfway between my previous offer ($16,000) and Bob's offer ($13,500). This shows a willingness to compromise and find a common ground. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product for Bob.
* **Urgency and limited rounds:** While I'm still willing to negotiate, I'm subtly suggesting that we need to reach an agreement soon, reminding Bob about the limited rounds remaining.
* **Maintaining leverage:** While I'm moving closer to Bob's price, I'm not accepting his offer yet, as I still have leverage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $13,000. How about we meet at $13,000? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds:**  We are down to only 4 rounds left. 
* **Price too low:**  Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  
* **Risk of further negotiation:**  I'm unsure if I can push Bob any higher in the remaining rounds. 
* **John's offer is safe:** Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price and a safer option than risking further negotiation. 

While I'd like to maximize my profit, I'm choosing to minimize risk and secure a guaranteed sale with John."
