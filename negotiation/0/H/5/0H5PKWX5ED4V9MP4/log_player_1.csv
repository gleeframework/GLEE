Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you know he might be very price-sensitive. If he counters, it opens up a negotiation. 
* **Safety Net:** You always have John as a backup buyer at your minimum acceptable price, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
