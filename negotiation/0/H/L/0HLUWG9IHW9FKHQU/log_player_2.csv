{""message"": ""I'm very interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"

# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However,  $1000000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.
