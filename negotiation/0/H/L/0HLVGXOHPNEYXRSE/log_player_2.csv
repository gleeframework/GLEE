Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too far below my target.
