"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm quite interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price is still fair, considering the product's value, and it gives us both a chance to make a good deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $750,000.  Would that be doable?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $750,000 is still a bit too far below my target.  To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant price reduction from my initial offer and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in closing the deal at this price.",800000.0,Alice,5,
