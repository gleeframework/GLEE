,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $175. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $175 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my original offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",100.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $100. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $155. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",155.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're willing to go up to $125, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for that price. I'll make one more compromise. I'll sell it to you for $145. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",145.0,Alice,7,
