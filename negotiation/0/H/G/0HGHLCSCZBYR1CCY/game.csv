"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product.",1125000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,875,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate.",1875000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can stretch to $1,350,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering it's closer to your asking price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I respect your budget, but $1,350,000 remains below what I can accept. To bridge the gap, let's consider $1,687,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal.",1687500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,537,500?  This brings us much closer and shows I'm serious about making this work.",1537500.0,Bob,6,
