Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,125,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $1,125,000 is significantly below its true value.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,875,000. This reflects its worth while acknowledging your willingness to negotiate."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have a budget in mind. I can stretch to $1,350,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering it's closer to your asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but we're still significantly below my minimum. It's worth another counter-offer to see if I can bring him closer to $1.5 million."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your persistence.  I respect your budget, but $1,350,000 remains below what I can accept. To bridge the gap, let's consider $1,687,500. This represents a significant compromise on my end, demonstrating my willingness to make a deal."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,537,500?  This brings us much closer and shows I'm serious about making this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,537,500. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob's offer is now above our minimum acceptable price. While we could try to push for more, accepting now guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or us running out of rounds."
