"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. This is a great price considering the value it offers. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know Bob is willing to pay, but still below my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build rapport and make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Room for negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for both of us to negotiate. 

I'm confident that this initial offer will initiate a productive negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While I'm not completely opposed to selling to Bob, it's too early to accept his offer. I want to see if I can push him closer to my desired price. I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still reflects the product's value. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my price from the previous round, but still maintaining a price above my minimum threshold.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, justifying my price and suggesting it's a good deal for him. 
* **Collaborative tone:** I'm focusing on finding a solution that benefits both of us, highlighting the win-win potential of the deal. 

This counteroffer aims to keep the negotiation moving forward while staying within my acceptable price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000 for the product. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective positions.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits us both. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to accept a price lower than my minimum, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my full asking price. 

I believe there's still room to negotiate with Bob. I'll continue to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually acceptable price before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,400,000.  We're getting closer.  I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's value, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm offering you the product for $1,450,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Building momentum:** I'm acknowledging Bob's compromise and emphasizing our progress towards a deal.
* **""Meeting halfway"" strategy:** I'm proposing a price that's exactly in the middle of our last two offers, suggesting a balanced solution.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by encouraging Bob to ""close the deal,"" subtly implying that we're nearing the end of negotiations. 

By focusing on compromise, fairness, and a win-win outcome, I aim to convince Bob to accept this offer and finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to get a fair price, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000, which is a significant compromise from my previous offer. It's a good price for both of us, as it allows me to stay within my budget and leaves you with a respectable profit.  Let's close this deal! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While we have gone through several rounds of negotiations, we are running out of time.  I'm not confident that I can get Bob to meet my minimum price in the remaining rounds.  Therefore, I will choose to sell the product to John for $1,500,000, which is my guaranteed minimum price."
