"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it's a compromise that I'm willing to make to reach a deal with you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,050,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
