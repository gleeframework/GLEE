While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,000,000 makes the most sense at this stage. Here's why:

* **Significant Profit:**  I'm still making a profit of $200,000 ($1,000,000 - $800,000).
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids further negotiation rounds and potential delays, allowing me to reinvest the earnings sooner. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** There's always a risk Bob could walk away, leaving me to negotiate with John who might change his offer. 

Accepting $1,000,000 secures a good profit with minimal risk at this point."
