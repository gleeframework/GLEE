"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit steep at $1200000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900000 doesn't quite reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price that considers your needs while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Can you consider this offer?",950000.0,Bob,4,
