Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to earn as much as possible. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still ensuring a significant profit for you. 
* **Balance Risk and Reward:** Offering it too high might make Bob walk away, leading you to the guaranteed but lower offer from John. This price aims to secure a deal with Bob while maximizing your potential earnings."
