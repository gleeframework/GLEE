"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Would you be willing to go down to $140? ",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $140 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $160, but that's as low as I can go.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $150. This is a fair price for us both as it's right in the middle between what I'm willing to pay and what you're willing to sell for.",150.0,Bob,4,
