"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. However, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the value of the product to me and its worth to you.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm not comfortable going any lower than $975000.  This still leaves significant room for profit for you, and it's a fair price considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find common ground.",975000.0,Alice,3,
