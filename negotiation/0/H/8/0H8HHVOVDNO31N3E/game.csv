"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $85 right now.  What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below $105. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $102.5. What do you think?",102.5,Alice,5,
