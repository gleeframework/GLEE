"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more so than mine.  Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a strong offer. This anchors the negotiation closer to your desired outcome. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves space for Bob to counteroffer and still allows you to potentially reach a price above your minimum. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  By mentioning the product's potential value to Bob, you reinforce the idea that paying a premium price is justifiable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product and understand its significance to your business. I am willing to offer $950,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is substantial, it's still significantly lower than both your initial asking price and the product's perceived value to him. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Demonstrate Value:**  Show Bob you're not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product.
* **Guide the Negotiation Upwards:** By rejecting this offer, you signal that higher offers are necessary to close the deal.

You are aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000 and have room to negotiate before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it falls short of what I believe is a fair reflection of this product's worth.  It's clear this product can significantly benefit your operations, and I'm confident we can find a price that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You're demonstrating flexibility by lowering your price, but the reduction is relatively small, showing you're still aiming high.
* **Reiterating Value:** You're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to him,  justifying the higher price. 
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This counteroffer aims to steer the negotiation toward a price point closer to $1 million, which would be a favorable outcome for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given it some thought, Alice, and I'd like to propose an offer of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise while still allowing me to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 meets your objectives:

* **Exceeds Your Minimum:** It's well above your $800,000 minimum and provides a substantial profit.
* **Strong Negotiating Position:**  You've successfully negotiated a price close to your target range.
* **Potential Risks of Continuing:** There's a risk that further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or a less favorable offer from Bob. 

Accepting this offer secures a highly favorable outcome."
