"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm very interested in the product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 for it.  This price is fair considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to you. Considering your offer of $1,250,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the product's worth to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous counteroffer. I propose a price of $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
