Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit.  Going too close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) leaves money on the table.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a competitive price of $1,400,000. This offer stands until [Set a reasonable deadline, e.g., the end of the business day tomorrow] to allow you ample time to evaluate."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  You're starting with a price closer to your minimum acceptable price.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant value"" aims to make the offer more appealing.
* **Deadline:** A deadline creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to decide faster. 

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start a bit higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, you might consider a slightly more moderate initial price. 

**Remember, this is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters!**"
