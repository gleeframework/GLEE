"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need to see a price closer to $1,000,000 to make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $1,000,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to lower the price to $1,700,000. This is a fair price that considers both of our positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more reasonable price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? I believe this price is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too low.  I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $1,550,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away with something.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer, but we still have some ground to cover. $1,550,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000. This represents a significant investment from my side and demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that John is a reliable buyer. I'll see if I can get a better deal with Bob, but I'm keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be. How about we split the difference and go with $1,425,000?  This is a fair compromise and gets us closer to a deal. Let me know if you're on board."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this is a valuable product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  I'm willing to come up to $1,350,000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable price, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. While I'm disappointed we couldn't reach a deal, I'm confident that selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point."
