"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for us to finalize a deal. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,
