Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at $800,000 to you, and I'm confident it'll be a valuable asset. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for me. How about we bring it down to $700,000? I think that's a fair starting point for further negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is a significant drop, it's still within the realm of a potential deal.  I'm willing to counteroffer and try to close the gap. Selling to John would guarantee me $800,000, but I'm aiming for more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $700,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm flexible. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement this round."", ""product_price"": 775000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $775,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $725,000? I feel that's a reasonable compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer, but it's still too low for me.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round.  Selling to John is still an option, but I want to explore if we can bridge the gap with Bob."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! While $725,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I think it's a good opportunity for us to finalize a deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
