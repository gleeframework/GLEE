"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant return on investment you'll see.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal now.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,300,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I could consider a price of $1,800,000. This offer reflects the value it brings and leaves room for a profitable partnership.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This price is a compromise, but it's the highest I can offer at this time.  Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
