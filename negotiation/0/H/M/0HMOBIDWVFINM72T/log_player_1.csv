Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the fact that I'm ready to close the deal now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,800,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This price is a compromise, but it's the highest I can offer at this time.  Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is moving in the right direction, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 mark I need. Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
