"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I'm confident you'll love. It's a one-of-a-kind item that has a lot of value to the right buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $10,000. It's too risky to accept this offer without trying to negotiate a lower price. You have 9 more rounds to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product,  $15,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, considering the value I see in it."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's important to start your counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This creates room for negotiation and shows your serious intent to bargain.
* **Reasonable Justification:**  Provide a brief reason for your offer. In this case, you're highlighting the perceived value of the product while acknowledging the budget constraint.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $8,000 is a significant step down from $15,000, but still leaves room for Alice to come back with a counteroffer that might be acceptable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 15000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 12000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, $12,000 is still above my budget. I have several rounds left to negotiate. By rejecting this offer, I can continue to push for a lower price and potentially get closer to my target of $10,000 or below."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $12,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $9,500? I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Adjustment:**  Instead of a drastic drop, I'm incrementally moving closer to my desired price. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Interest:**  I reiterate my interest in the product to keep Alice engaged in the negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  Using phrases like ""we can find a price"" maintains a collaborative atmosphere."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close but No Cigar:** While Alice's offer is now within my budget, it's still $500 above my desired price.  I have one last round to try and get that final discount. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:**  Alice has been willing to compromise throughout the negotiations.  There's a chance I can push for a lower price in the final round.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Buying from John for $10,000 is guaranteed, but the potential for getting the product from Alice for less is worth the risk, given I have only one round left."
