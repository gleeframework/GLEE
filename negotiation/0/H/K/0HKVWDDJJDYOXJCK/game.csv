"I understand that you're making a final offer, Bob. However, I've already compromised quite a bit, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer. I'm now offering it to you for $14750. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",14750.0,Alice,7,
