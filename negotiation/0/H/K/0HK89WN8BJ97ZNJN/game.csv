"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $1,100,000 is still a little steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
