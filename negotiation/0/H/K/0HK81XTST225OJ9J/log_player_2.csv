# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,350,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,350,000 is a good deal compared to John's price, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the value of this product is truly significant. I can come down slightly to $1,250,000. This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still a potential for a better deal. Rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure an even lower price."
