"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However, I'm looking to invest less in this product. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to invest in the product while ensuring you still get a good return.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
