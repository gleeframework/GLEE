"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. Let's see if we can work something out.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $750,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $825,000 is still a little high for me. How about $800,000? That's a fair price considering the product's value to both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
