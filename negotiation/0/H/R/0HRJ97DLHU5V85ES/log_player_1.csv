Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Dear Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will significantly benefit you. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:** Starting at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying comfortably above your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, subtly justifying the high price.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you're comfortable potentially losing the sale to Bob if he's unwilling to meet your price."
