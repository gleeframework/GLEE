,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at the moment. How about $90? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I understand that $110 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $105? I think it's a fair compromise that works for both of us.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $97.50.  That's a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, and I appreciate the compromise you're willing to make. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $97.50. How about we meet in the middle at $101.50? I think it's a fair price that takes into account the value I place on the product.",101.5,Alice,5,
