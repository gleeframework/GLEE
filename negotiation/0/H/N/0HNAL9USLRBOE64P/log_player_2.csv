It's always a good idea to try to negotiate a better price.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $1,000,000, there's a good chance you can get it for less."

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's still room to bargain, and it's better than paying $900,000 if you can get it cheaper."

This counteroffer increases the price slightly from your previous offer, showing Alice you're serious about buying the product while still trying to keep the price below $900,000."
