"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is better than $150, there's still room for negotiation. Since the product is worth $120 to Alice, it's likely she'll accept a price closer to that. Rejecting her offer allows me to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $130, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $140.  This is still above her minimum acceptable price of $120, leaving room for her to make a profit.  I believe this offer is fair and increases the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $5 more than my last offer.  While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely I'll get much lower. Accepting this offer saves me $15 compared to buying from John."
