Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefit you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 1150000} 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without losing him to John's guaranteed offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's valuation allows room for negotiation if needed.
* **Strong Initial Offer:** The message emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price."
