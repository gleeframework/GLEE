Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000.  Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Aiming for Surplus:**  A price of $15,000 allows for a potential $3,000 profit above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to negotiate down, and you can potentially meet somewhere in the middle. 

**Important Note:** This is just one possible strategy.  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer, but it maximizes potential profit while still being a plausible price he might consider."
