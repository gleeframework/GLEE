{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,000.  It's worth a lot to me, but I think it's a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer sets a high starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good price.  It also frames the offer in a way that acknowledges Bob's potential benefit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to drop down to $10,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 just isn't enough for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 12000}
