"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $12,750.",12750.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm feeling more comfortable with $12,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to reach an agreement. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
