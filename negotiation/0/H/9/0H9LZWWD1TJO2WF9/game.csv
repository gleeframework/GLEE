"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your valuation of the product. However, I am not able to meet the price of $950,000. Would you consider lowering the price to $850,000? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position. While I appreciate your offer, $850,000 is still below my desired range. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This reflects a compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
