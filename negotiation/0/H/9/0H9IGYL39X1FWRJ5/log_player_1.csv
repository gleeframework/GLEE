"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $6,000 is too low, and I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."", ""product_price"": 7500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a higher price, but $7,500 is still a bit too steep for me. Could you do $6,800? I'm trying to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my desired price, I still think I can get a bit more. I'll counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $6,800 is still a little too low for me. I'm offering $7,200.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's the best I can do at this point."", ""product_price"": 7200}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $7,000 is a good price and it's getting close to the end of our negotiations. It's better to close the deal now than risk losing Bob altogether and having to sell to John for a lower price."
