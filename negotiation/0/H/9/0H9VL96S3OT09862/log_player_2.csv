"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it's a perfect fit for you, and its value to you surely exceeds my asking price of $1,150,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
