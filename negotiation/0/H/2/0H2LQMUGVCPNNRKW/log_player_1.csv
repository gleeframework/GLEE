"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting with a price of $130, which is above Bob's perceived value but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still ensuring a decent profit for me.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and highlighting the potential benefit to Bob, hoping to create a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $110 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $110 is still too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $120? This would still be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $120, a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. This shows flexibility and willingness to reach an agreement. 
* **Message:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's point while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential benefits of the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of reaching a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $117.50. This is a fair price that takes into account both our needs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 117.5}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $117.50, a compromise between Bob's offer and my previous counteroffer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to reach an agreement.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's position and emphasizing the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement.

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting to feel the pressure to close the deal. While $117.50 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price and is likely a price Bob would be willing to accept.  I want to avoid selling to John for $150, as I could potentially make more by continuing negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $112.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

I've reached a point where continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to lead to a price that meets my minimum acceptable value of $150.  While I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, I've already had 5 rounds of negotiations and I'm not confident that further negotiation will significantly improve the price.  To avoid the risk of ending up with a price lower than my minimum, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
