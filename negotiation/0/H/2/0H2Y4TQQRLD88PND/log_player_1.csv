``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation.  It also emphasizes that I'm open to hearing Bob's counteroffer, which encourages him to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
