{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $9,000, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above what the product is worth to Bob, hoping to leave some room for negotiation.  By being open to negotiation, I'm aiming to find a price that works for both of us.  However, I'm also keeping in mind that I have a backup buyer in John who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his counteroffer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $7,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  Let's see if we can find a happy medium here. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for considering my previous offer and coming down to $8,500. I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $8,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for both of us.  There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the deal. I'm happy to sell to Bob at this price."
