"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product at a special price of $18,000. It's a great opportunity to get a high-end item at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is far above my maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth exploring negotiation with Alice to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""While I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product but would only be able to purchase it for $10,000.  This is my maximum offer.  Let me know if you're willing to consider it."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10,000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price for it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than her previous offer, it's still above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating and see if I can get a better price.  I may be able to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $11,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but $11,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $13,500. This is as low as I can go, and I hope you'll consider it a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is clearly trying to meet me in the middle, $13,500 is still outside of my ideal price range. I'm only willing to pay $10,000 for this product, and since I have the option to purchase from John at that price, I'm going to continue to negotiate with Alice and see if we can reach a final agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I'm  grateful for your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still only able to pay $12,000. This is a fair price given our previous negotiations and my budget. I hope you'll consider my offer as a final compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to make one last attempt to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm counteroffering at $13,500 again, but I'm also willing to throw in some additional perks, such as a warranty and support package, to sweeten the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Even with the added perks, Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above my maximum budget of $10,000.  I've made multiple counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them.  I'm not confident that further negotiation will result in a price I'm comfortable with.  Therefore, I'm going to purchase the product from John for $10,000. This ensures I get the product at my desired price and avoids further negotiations."
