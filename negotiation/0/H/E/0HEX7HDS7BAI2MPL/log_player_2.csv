"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product which has been meticulously designed to meet your specific needs. This product holds significant value to us at $15,000, but considering its importance to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. To start our negotiation, I propose a price of $13,000. This allows us to maintain a fair transaction while ensuring you receive a valuable asset at a reasonable cost. I look forward to your response and hope we can proceed towards a mutually beneficial arrangement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $13,000 is a decent offer, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell, and you have a better alternative with John at $15,000. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get Alice to come down closer to her value of $10,000."
