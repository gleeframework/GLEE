Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate but still leaving me with a significant profit.
* **Message:** I'm framing it as a ""fantastic deal"" to make it more appealing to Bob. 
* **John as Backup:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If Bob rejects my offer or if the negotiation becomes too drawn out, I have a guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is a significant sum, it's still far below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, especially since I have John's offer as a safety net.

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value while keeping in mind his budget constraints."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I can't go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This still gives you a great value for the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing a price midway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise while still keeping my goal of earning a significant amount.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's budget constraints and framing the counteroffer as a fair compromise. This helps to keep the negotiation amicable and open to a deal.
* **John's Offer:**  I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, as it allows me to walk away from this negotiation if it becomes too protracted or if Bob refuses to budge on his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm still interested in the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I could continue to counter-offer, the risk of further negotiation is high.  It's highly likely that Bob will continue to lowball me, and the process could drag on. 

I'm not willing to risk losing so much money.  I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 offer from John, which is much more in line with my desired price and significantly higher than what Bob is offering.  

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John to secure the best possible outcome."
