{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently making small increments in his offers and seems unwilling to budge significantly from his initial offer. At this point, continuing the negotiation presents a high risk of ending up with a deal significantly lower than John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed $1,200,000."
