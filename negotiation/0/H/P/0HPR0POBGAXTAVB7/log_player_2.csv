You can get the product for less than $90, so it's worth trying to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $85?"", ""product_price"": 85}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your offer of $85 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $87.50? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $80 to Alice, and Alice is offering it for $87.5. This is still a good deal for Bob, who values it at $100. Accepting this offer is the best option."
