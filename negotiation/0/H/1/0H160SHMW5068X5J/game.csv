"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, your starting price is a bit high for my budget. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I could potentially go up to $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering.",900000.0,Alice,5,
