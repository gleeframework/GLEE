Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch. I could potentially go up to $700,000.  That's a significant investment for me, but I'm willing to make it if we can reach an agreement."",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to invest in the product, but $700,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I think it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is not budging significantly on price. Her latest offer of $900,000 is still considerably higher than John's offer of $800,000.  It's unlikely she'll come down enough to make it worth continuing the negotiation.  Buying from John guarantees the best price."
