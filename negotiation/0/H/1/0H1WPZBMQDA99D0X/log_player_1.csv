Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** At $100, you're still leaving some room for negotiation but not giving away too much.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without you needing to immediately accept anything below your $120 minimum. 
* **It's friendly:** A positive message can help Bob feel more open to negotiation.

By starting here, you can gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's still far below your minimum of $120.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to try and negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $95.  This would be a great deal for you, and it still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired outcome.  You're better off rejecting Bob's offer and trying to negotiate a higher price.  At this point, you might consider making a final counteroffer before switching to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to go down to $92.  This is my final offer, as I'm not sure I can go any lower. If you're interested, let's finalize this deal. Otherwise, I'll need to move on to other buyers."", ""product_price"": 92}
