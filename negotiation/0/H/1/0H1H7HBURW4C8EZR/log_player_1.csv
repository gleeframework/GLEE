Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value, even beyond the $10,000 you estimate it's worth. Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer lined up."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible. Since you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $19,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning another buyer encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer without trying to haggle too much. 

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this price. However, this strategy provides a good balance between maximizing potential profit and ensuring a sale."
