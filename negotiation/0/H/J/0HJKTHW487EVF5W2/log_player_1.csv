Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price. I'm confident I can sell the product to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail, so I'm not overly concerned about losing the sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is significantly below my minimum value. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer. Hopefully, this shows my willingness to negotiate while maintaining a fair price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $110 is closer to my minimum, it's still not a great price. I'm not willing to risk going further with Bob. It's time to move on to John and secure a guaranteed $120."
