"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this unique product.  While I see the value, $999000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to come down to $950000?  I'm confident that we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $975000. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth to me.",975000.0,Alice,3,
