Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I appreciate your openness to negotiation. I am willing to pay $8,200 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $8,200, I'm confident I can get a better price. I have 9 more rounds to negotiate, and I can always sell to John for $10,000 if things don't work out."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit higher than that. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750? That's a good compromise for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'd like to stick to my original offer of $8,200. I hope we can find a way to agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  He's stuck at $8,200, and I'm not willing to go that low.  I still have 6 more rounds to negotiate and can always sell to John for $10,000. I'm hoping I can convince Bob to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make a bit more than $8,200. How about we compromise at $8,500? It's a fair price that's closer to both our positions. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I'm still committed to my original offer of $8,200. I hope we can reach an agreement on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200

This is getting frustrating. Bob is being stubborn and refusing to budge from his $8,200 offer.  I've already made several counteroffers and he's not coming up.  I've only got 4 rounds left, and I'm not sure I can get him to increase his offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's not my ideal outcome, but it's better than risking getting stuck with a price I'm not happy with."
