# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $9,200.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal at $9,050. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses and buy from John. You've negotiated as much as you can with Alice, and you're getting close to your target price.  There's no guarantee that you'll be able to get Alice to go lower, and you've only got a few rounds left.  It's better to secure the product from John at your target price and move on."
