"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great price, considering the value it brings to your business.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $8,500 at this time.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $9,200. This is still a great value for the product, and I think it's a fair price considering the benefits it will bring to your business.",9200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $9,200 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $8,800. This would be a good deal for both of us.",8800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,800. I'm thinking of offering you a deal at $9,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great value for the product.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,900. This would be a fair deal for both of us and get this transaction done.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $8,900. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you a deal at $9,050. This is the best I can do, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",9050.0,Alice,7,
