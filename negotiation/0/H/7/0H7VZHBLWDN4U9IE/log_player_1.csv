Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

Bob's offer is at my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate. I'm happy to accept his offer and close the deal."
