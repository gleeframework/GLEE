"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. I'm confident this will be a mutually beneficial deal.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's better to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is still a good deal for you considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,600,000 is still above your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully secure a price closer to your target. Remember, you have the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
