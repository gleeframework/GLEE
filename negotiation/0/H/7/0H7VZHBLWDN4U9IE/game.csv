"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is still a good deal for you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price.  Let's make this work.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $1,600,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which is my absolute maximum.  This price reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
