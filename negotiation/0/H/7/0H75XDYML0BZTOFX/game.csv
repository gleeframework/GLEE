"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  I'm willing to move from my initial position, but $1,200,000 is below what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I envisioned, I'm still looking for a bit more. Let's settle this right now - would you consider $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting close to your price, Alice, but I still think I can do better. I'm willing to pay $1,280,000 for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
