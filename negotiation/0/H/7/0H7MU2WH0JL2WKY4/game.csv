"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about we meet in the middle at $8,500? It's still a good deal for you, considering the product's worth to you.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $7,500 is a bit low for you, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $8,200? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that. What do you think?",8200.0,Bob,4,
