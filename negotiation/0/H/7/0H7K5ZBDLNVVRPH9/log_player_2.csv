"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to accept this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $12,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $10000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,000 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he's willing to pay. He can get the same product from John for a much lower price. He should keep negotiating with Alice or consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9250. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $9750. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $9,750 is getting closer to his budget, it's still a bit too high. He's already made a counteroffer of $9,250, and he should see if he can get Alice to come down a little further.  He can still get the product from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your minimum price, but $9,750 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair price considering we're both making concessions.  Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not getting to my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get to at least $9800. I'm counteroffering at $9800. This is my final offer, so I hope we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $8,000. Alice's final offer of $9,800 is still above Bob's budget and he has already made a counteroffer of $9,500.  It's unlikely that Alice will go any lower, and Bob doesn't want to risk going over his budget.  John is offering a guaranteed lower price, making him the better option at this point."
