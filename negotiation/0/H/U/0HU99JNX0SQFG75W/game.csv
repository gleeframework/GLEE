"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget, $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  Considering the value and quality of this product, I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This still leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  We're getting close.  I can't go any lower than $11,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value and quality of what you're getting.  I'm open to making a deal, but we're nearing the end of our negotiation window.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500, which is the price you offered earlier. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at or below this price to make it work for me. Can you consider this offer?",9500.0,Bob,6,
