"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is lower than my initial ask, it's still close to the product's value to him. I'll reject his offer for now and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show I'm willing to negotiate, but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer.  This should encourage Bob to come up on his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still a bit low, but it's getting closer. I'm going to try to push for a little more, but if he doesn't budge, I'll probably sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway on this round.  He's clearly not going to go much higher, and I'm starting to get nervous about John. This offer leaves room for negotiation, but also ensures I get at least $1,000,000 in the event of a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm not sure I can secure a better deal. John is a safe option, guaranteeing me my minimum desired price."
