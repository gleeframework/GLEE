"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $110. It's a fair price considering the product's value, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking to get closer to $90, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can offer it to you for $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",100.0,Alice,5,
