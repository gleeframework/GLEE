Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity with tremendous potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to sell it for $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high price ($1,200,000) to give myself room to negotiate down. 
* **Highlighting Value:** The message emphasizes the product's uniqueness and potential value, aiming to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear that I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting with a strong position.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer (if any). 
* I'll keep John's $800,000 offer in mind as a safety net, but I'll aim for a higher price if possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $800000. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get more.
* **Potential for a higher offer:** There's still room for negotiation. If Bob is truly interested, I might be able to secure a higher price in subsequent rounds.
* **Avoiding immediate sale:** Selling to John now would guarantee my minimum, but I want to maximize my profit.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer ($1,200,000) but still below it, showing flexibility while maintaining a higher desired price. 
* **Negotiation strategy:** I'll be prepared to negotiate further depending on Bob's response. 
* **Keeping John's offer in mind:** I'll still keep John's offer as a fallback option, but I'll aim for a better deal with Bob if possible."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest! While $800,000 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a middle ground. Considering the unique value and potential of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by reducing my price from $1,200,000 to $1,000,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's unique value and potential, hoping to justify the price point.
* **Open to Finalization:** The message suggests that this could be a final offer, prompting Bob to make a decision.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's Response:** I will carefully evaluate Bob's next move (accept, reject, or counteroffer) to determine my next steps. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I'll keep John's offer in mind as a secure option if negotiations with Bob fall through.
* **Negotiation Flexibility:** I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm aiming to secure a price as close to $1,000,000 as possible."
