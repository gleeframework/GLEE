"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm open to negotiation, but I'm looking for at least $11,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but lower than my minimum ($12,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate and leaves me some room to come down.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to create a sense of opportunity for Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to find a mutually agreeable price, but I'm also setting a clear minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While I want to close the deal, $9,000 is still lower than my minimum of $12,000.  
* **There are more rounds:**  I have time to negotiate further and potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** If negotiations with Bob fail, I can always sell to John for $12,000, guaranteeing my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your offer, I need to be closer to $10,000 to make this work. Let's split the difference and see if we can agree on that."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price halfway between Bob's last offer and my previous one, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and direct:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while reiterating my own needs, maintaining a friendly tone.
* **Focus on a mutual solution:**  I'm suggesting a split-the-difference approach to encourage a quick agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short. I'd be willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $9,500 is still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is progressing:**  Bob is showing a willingness to go up in price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If we can't reach a deal, I can always sell to John and ensure my minimum."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm happy to meet you halfway again, but I need to be at $9,750 to make this work. How about we call it a deal at that price?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to compromise:** I'm showing continued willingness to negotiate by offering a price slightly higher than Bob's but still below my ideal.
* **Focusing on a final deal:** The message emphasizes closing the deal and encourages Bob to accept.
* **A price that's closer to my minimum:** $9,750 is significantly closer to my minimum of $12,000 than previous offers, potentially making Bob more inclined to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit short, but I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited rounds remaining:**  We're down to the last five rounds, and Bob is not budging much from his price point. 
* **Risk of getting stuck:** If I keep rejecting Bob's offer, there's a high risk that we won't reach an agreement before the rounds run out, leaving me with nothing.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired profit of $12,000, which is better than potentially getting a lower price from Bob or getting no sale at all. 

It's important to prioritize maximizing profit while also considering the risk of getting stuck in a negotiation. In this case, selling to John ensures a secure outcome."
