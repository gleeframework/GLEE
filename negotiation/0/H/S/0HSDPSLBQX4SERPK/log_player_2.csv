I understand you have other options, but I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. Please let me know your decision.

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Rejecting Alice's offer means Bob can negotiate with John, potentially getting a lower price or finding a similar product from another seller."
