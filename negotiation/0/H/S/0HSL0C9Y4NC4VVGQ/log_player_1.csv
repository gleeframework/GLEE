"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm beginning with a strong offer significantly above both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price, even though I haven't revealed specifics about the product.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative, assuring Bob that I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.

**Strategy:**  My goal is to maximize profit while remaining aware of the $1,500,000 safety net with John.  By starting high, I aim to:

1. **Anchor:**  Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:** His response will reveal how badly he wants the product and his potential price range. 
3. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  I'm prepared to make concessions in later rounds while still aiming for a price well above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This price reflects a fair value for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at the cost of a substantial loss. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counter:** I will reject Bob's offer and propose a counteroffer that remains above my minimum while signaling a willingness to move closer to his range. 
* **Maintain Alternative:** It's still early in the negotiation. I'll continue to leverage the standing offer from John as a safety net, ensuring I don't feel pressured to accept a low offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $2,200,000 was my initial position, I'm open to finding a compromise.  To move things forward, I'm proposing a revised price of $1,850,000. This reflects the significant value this product brings while acknowledging your perspective."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Reduction:**  I've made a substantial reduction from my initial offer, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about finding a deal. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  The new price is still considerably above both Bob's offer and my minimum.  This allows room for further negotiation while aiming for a profitable outcome.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a collaborative and understanding tone, emphasizing that I value Bob's perspective and am seeking a mutually agreeable solution. 

**Strategy:**

I'm employing a gradual concession strategy. By making a substantial move first, I hope to encourage Bob to reciprocate with a significant counteroffer in the next round. My goal remains to secure a price well above my $1,500,000 minimum while avoiding a stalemate that might push me towards accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $1,850,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair compromise considering my budget.  I believe this price still allows you a decent profit and lets us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating more aggressively, but his offer is still below my $1,500,000 minimum. While he increased his bid, it's not enough to warrant accepting. I need to hold firm to secure a favorable deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Maintain Pressure:** I will reject this offer to signal that I'm not desperate and that a deal closer to my terms is necessary.
* **Smaller Concession:** My next counteroffer will involve a smaller reduction to show I'm moving towards a compromise, but not at the cost of a significant loss. 
* **Time Consideration:**  As rounds progress, I'll need to be more mindful of the remaining rounds and consider if the potential profit from Bob outweighs the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,625,000.  I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while recognizing the need for a fair deal on both sides."",
""product_price"": 1625000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** I've reduced my price by $225,000, which is a significant drop but less than my previous reduction. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a strong price.
* **Midpoint Emphasis:** The new price of $1,625,000 is almost exactly halfway between my previous offer ($1,850,000) and Bob's last offer ($1,300,000). This can be a psychologically compelling point in negotiations.
* **Value and Fairness:** I continue to reinforce the product's value while highlighting the importance of a mutually beneficial deal. 

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming to find a compromise within the next round or two. If Bob doesn't meet me closer to my target price soon, I'll need to seriously consider accepting John's offer to avoid the risk of a stalemate as we approach the final rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm happy to see you're willing to negotiate.  However, $1,625,000 is still outside of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  It's a significant step towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum, but I believe there's still room for him to move. Accepting $1,400,000 would be a significant loss compared to John's offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Push:** I'll make one last strong counteroffer. My goal is to either secure a price comfortably above $1,500,000 or get a clear signal from Bob that he's unwilling to go any higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** With only four rounds left, I'll be prepared to walk away and accept John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my target. The risk of a stalemate is increasing."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and meet me halfway. To show I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,550,000. This is my best and final offer, as I need to ensure a fair return on this unique product."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** This counteroffer is my final push to secure a price above my guaranteed option with John. The language is firm (""best and final offer"") to signal that this is not a starting point for further haggling.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $1,550,000 is a strong offer, providing a $50,000 buffer above my minimum while still offering Bob a considerable discount from my initial asking price. 
* **Time Constraint:**  I'm making it clear that time is a factor. With only three rounds remaining, Bob needs to understand the urgency and the potential consequences of not reaching an agreement.

**Strategy:**

This offer is designed to elicit a clear and prompt response from Bob. He can either:

1. **Accept:**  This is the ideal outcome, as it secures a profitable deal.
2. **Counter with a significant increase:**  If Bob is truly motivated, he might be willing to make one last push to secure the product. 
3. **Reject/Stalemate:** If this offer is rejected or leads to minimal counteroffers, I will walk away in the next round and accept John's offer.  The risk of letting the remaining rounds expire without a deal is too high."
