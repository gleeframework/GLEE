**Reasoning:**  We're still significantly below my minimum. It's time to apply more pressure by reminding Bob of John's standing offer."

Round 5

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair, but I need to see more movement on your end to justify continuing this negotiation. My final offer is $1,005,000. This is a significant discount from my other buyer's offer.  If you're unable to meet this price, I'll have to move forward with them."",
