"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's still significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price or move forward with purchasing from John at a better deal."
