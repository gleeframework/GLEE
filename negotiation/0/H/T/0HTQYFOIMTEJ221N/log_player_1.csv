{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love. I'm asking for $140 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances maximizing your profit while still leaving room for negotiation. It's above your minimum price of $120, but below Bob's perceived value of $150.  This encourages Bob to accept the offer, but also leaves room for him to counteroffer if he feels it's too high."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still aiming for a higher profit.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price of $140 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about $135? That's closer to my initial price and still a great deal for you considering the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure I'm comfortable with $135. I'd be willing to go up to $132, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is just a little bit below my ideal price, but it's still a good deal.  It's higher than what I could get from John, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.  I'll accept his offer."
