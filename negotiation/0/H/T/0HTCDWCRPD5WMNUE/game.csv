"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm! While the product looks great, I'm aiming to stay under $15,000 for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $14,500? ",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we split the difference and settle on $15,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $15,500. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I can offer the product to you for $16,250. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value and quality.",16250.0,Alice,5,
