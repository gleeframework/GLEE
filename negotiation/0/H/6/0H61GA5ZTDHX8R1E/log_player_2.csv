You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is a good deal, you can likely get it for less. Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt a counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation. It's a good starting point for a counteroffer, as it shows you are serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. While you would prefer a lower price, it's likely Alice won't budge much further. Accepting this offer allows you to acquire the product for a reasonable price within your budget."
