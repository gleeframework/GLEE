Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. It's better to secure the product from John at $1,200,000 and avoid further back-and-forth with Alice."
