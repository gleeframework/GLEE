"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the product's value, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $1,000,000. I believe that's a fair price that considers its worth to both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Considering the value this product brings to your business, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,350,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $1,350,000 is still pushing my budget.  I could go up to $1,150,000. That's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. Considering the value this product will bring to your business, I'm willing to meet you at $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits it brings.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
