"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $1,500,000, the maximum Bob is willing to pay. 
* **Strategy:**  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price. There are 10 rounds, so rejecting the initial offer gives Bob the opportunity to see if Alice is willing to lower her price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much as possible.  A significant discount is a good starting point to see if Alice is flexible.
* **Strategic Approach:** A counteroffer of $1,200,000 is a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This is a substantial offer that shows Bob is serious about negotiating while leaving room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $1,350,000, which is a $150,000 reduction from her original offer.
* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Strategic Analysis:** While Bob could continue negotiating, accepting Alice's offer at this point is a good decision. It secures a lower price compared to John's offer, and continuing negotiation could lead to further rounds and a risk of Alice ultimately rejecting Bob's offers. The $150,000 savings are significant, and accepting now avoids the potential of losing out on this deal entirely."
