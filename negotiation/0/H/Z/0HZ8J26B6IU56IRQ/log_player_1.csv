{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's higher than Bob's valuation, but lower than your minimum. This allows room for negotiation, and potentially a successful deal. I'm also trying to incentivize Bob by suggesting it's a great deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, I'm still willing to hold out for a bit more.  I'll counteroffer with a price slightly closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  This allows for further negotiation while keeping my potential earnings higher than if I accept immediately."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down to $95. This is a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's make this deal!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is too low for me. It's below my minimum, and I'm confident that I can get a better price from John. While I want to make a sale, it's more important to ensure I receive a fair price for my product. John's offer guarantees me my minimum, so I'll take that deal."
