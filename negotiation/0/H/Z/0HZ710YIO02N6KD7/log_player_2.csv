You have three options:

You should reject Alice's offer. While it's better than John's price, you can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $135?  That's my final offer.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135

Alice's offer of $135 is within your budget of $150 and a better deal than John's offer. It's worth accepting to save some money."
