"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's way over his budget, and there's no reason to accept it in the first round.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate the value of this product, $1,300,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair starting point for negotiation."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is truly significant. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice has come down some, $1,150,000 is still outside of Bob's budget.  He'll continue negotiating, but also needs to consider that John is a safer option at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $850,000. This is a significant amount for me, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a middle ground. How about we settle for $1,050,000? This demonstrates significant movement on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While Alice has moved closer to his budget, $1,050,000 is still outside of his $800,000 limit. He needs to keep pushing for a lower price, but also consider the time constraint and the potential for a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it reflects the value of this product while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to my valuation. I'm ready to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $975,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  Alice's final offer of $975,000 is still outside of his budget.  While he could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee he'll get a lower price from Alice, and he's running out of rounds.  Buying from John guarantees him the product at a price he can afford."
