"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. It's worth a great deal to both of us, and I believe we can find a mutually beneficial price. My initial offer is $1,400,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is higher than Bob's maximum budget, and there are still rounds left to negotiate.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,400,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This price is still significantly above your minimum, and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,300,000?  This price still leaves significant room for you to profit, while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still above Bob's desired price, but it's a significant step closer to his target.  He has already rejected one offer and Alice is demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. Continuing to reject offers could lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise, potentially resulting in a higher final price or a breakdown in negotiations. Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product within his budget and avoids the risk of paying more if he continues to negotiate."
