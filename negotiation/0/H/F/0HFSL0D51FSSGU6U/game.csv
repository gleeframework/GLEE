"I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. How about $100 for the product?",100.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $100 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference at $90? I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is tight.",90.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're interested in the product, Bob! However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet at $95? It's a good compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",95.0,Alice,5,
