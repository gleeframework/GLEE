"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is far too high. It's important to signal that you're looking for a significantly lower price.  Buying from John right now would be a hasty decision, as there's room for negotiation with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can find a more realistic number. I'm willing to offer $800,000."", 
""product_price"": 800000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it establishes a strong starting point for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** While the offer is low, it leaves ample room for Alice to counter and for us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Signaling Seriousness:** Offering a specific number, even if low, shows Alice that we are a serious buyer, just not at any cost."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value this brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but very slowly.  Her counteroffer is still way above our budget and shows she's not truly understanding the price point we're aiming for. We need to signal we're willing to walk away if she doesn't get closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  This product is valuable, but to make a deal work, we need to find a price point that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but only slightly. This shows we're willing to negotiate but are serious about the price range.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:**  By highlighting the need for a mutually beneficial deal, we remind Alice that her current price won't work for us.
* **Time Pressure:**  As we get closer to the 10-round limit, Alice may be more willing to compromise.  This offer keeps the pressure on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget you're working with. However, the gap between our positions is still quite wide.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,700,000 would not be worth it for me. I believe this offer reflects a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  While Alice is coming down, $1,700,000 is still significantly more than our $1,000,000 fallback option with John. 
* **Testing Alice's Resolve:** Alice seems anchored to her high valuation. We need to show we're willing to walk away to see if she'll make a more substantial move.
* **Mid-Negotiation Leverage:** We're past the halfway point in the rounds. Alice may become more flexible as the deadline approaches."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront:  $1,700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but only if the price is right. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair offer. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** We're increasing our offer, showing willingness to move, but making it clear that $1,700,000 is beyond our limit. 
* **Introducing Alternatives:** Mentioning ""other options"" (implicitly John) creates urgency and signals that we're not afraid to walk away.
* **Strategic Increase:**  The $1,100,000 offer is a significant jump, designed to gauge Alice's flexibility and potentially bridge the gap faster."
