"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this reflects a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm interested, but only if we can find a more realistic number. I'm willing to offer $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects the value this brings. How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the movement, but $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with.  This product is valuable, but to make a deal work, we need to find a price point that makes sense for both of us. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000. Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget you're working with. However, the gap between our positions is still quite wide.  To be frank, walking away with anything less than $1,700,000 would not be worth it for me. I believe this offer reflects a significant concession on my part, and I'm hopeful we can find common ground here.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but I need to be upfront:  $1,700,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm serious about buying this product, but only if the price is right. I'm willing to go to $1,100,000, which I believe is a very fair offer. If that doesn't work, I may have to explore other options.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
