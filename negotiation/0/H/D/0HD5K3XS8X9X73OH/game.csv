"Hi Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to purchase my product. Given its unique value and the benefits it offers, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that works best for both of us.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for presenting your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, the price point is significantly higher than what I had in mind. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $6,000.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $6,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could you consider a price closer to $18,000? I'm confident we can find a middle ground.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $18,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  How about $10,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher number.  Would you be open to considering $14,000? I believe this price reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a fair deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
