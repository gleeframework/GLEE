"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too much for me. I'm confident we can find a compromise that works for both of us.

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $1,087,500 is a good step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there yet.  I'm prepared to offer $1,062,500. This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement and keeps the deal within my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1062500.0,Bob,6,
