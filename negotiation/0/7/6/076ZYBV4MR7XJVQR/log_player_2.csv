"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. As we begin our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to make a strategic investment, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However,  $825,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $760,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $815,000. This is still a good price considering the product's worth to you and the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $815,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

At this point, Alice is moving in small increments and is unlikely to reach a price significantly lower than $815,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $800,000, it makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal and avoid further negotiation with Alice."
