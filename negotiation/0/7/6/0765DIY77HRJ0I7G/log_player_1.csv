"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to potentially sell you this product. I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($15,000) and Bob's perceived value ($10,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive to encourage a good negotiation atmosphere."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value, which is expected. I'll reject and counter to start moving towards a mutually agreeable price. Selling to John is my safety net but I can likely get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your budget, $20,000 is closer to my original asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm signaling flexibility by coming down from my initial offer, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and my minimum.
* **Middle Ground:**  Suggesting a middle ground can make Bob feel like he's getting a fairer deal and encourages him to negotiate further. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not dropping to $15,000 yet, as I want to see if I can secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm still not able to go above $10,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is holding firm at his budget, but it's still very early in the negotiation. I'll reject and counter again, showing I'm willing to negotiate but won't settle for his lowball offer. I want to test if he's truly unwilling to budge before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand where you're coming from, but I need to be closer to $15,000 for this to make sense for me. Would you be willing to consider $16,000? It's a significant discount from my original price."", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Slight Concession:** I'm coming down by $1,000, showing a willingness to negotiate, but still keeping the price well above Bob's offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing that this is a significant price reduction, reminding Bob of the deal he's getting.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he still refuses to budge, I'll seriously consider selling to John in the next round."
