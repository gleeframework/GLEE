"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects the true value of the product.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your asking price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",11000.0,Bob,4,
