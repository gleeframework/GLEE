Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's worth at least $150, but I'm willing to let you have it for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for potential negotiation and gives the impression the product is highly valued. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just your perceived value, can make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Urgency:** By mentioning you'll list it publicly, you subtly introduce a sense of urgency for Bob to make a decision. 

While Bob might try to negotiate down, this starting point gives you a good buffer to still make a significant profit above your $100 minimum. If he rejects the offer, you haven't lost anything, as you have John as a guaranteed backup buyer."
