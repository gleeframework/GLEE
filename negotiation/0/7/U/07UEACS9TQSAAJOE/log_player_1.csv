"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.  It also signals to Bob that I value the product highly.  We'll see if he's willing to bite."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is still lower than what I'm hoping to get, and I have room to negotiate further.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a smaller drop from my original offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise but still value the product.  I'm hoping Bob will see this as a good middle ground and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,200 is getting closer to my target, and I'm concerned about the time constraint.  It's time to take the deal, as further negotiations might not yield a significantly better price."
