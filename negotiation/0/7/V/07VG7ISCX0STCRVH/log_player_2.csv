"Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and counteroffer.  You can likely get a better price than $1,300,000, and you're not losing anything by negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the value we both see in this product.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, you still have room to negotiate further and potentially save more money. You're very close to John's price, so rejecting and counteroffering is a safe move."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a fair compromise given our starting points. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,150,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it ensures we both get what we want. What do you say?

Alice's offer is now at your maximum price.  It's a good deal, especially since it's the same price as John's. You don't have to continue negotiating and risk Alice walking away."
