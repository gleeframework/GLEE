"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above your target price. It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price from Alice. You have a strong position because you can walk away and buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her full asking price.  The $1,050,000 price point is a good starting point as it leaves a significant gap for negotiation but is still closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 above my ideal price of $1,000,000.  At this point, I'm willing to accept the deal. I've already negotiated a significant discount from her initial price, and further negotiation might risk losing the deal altogether. It's a good compromise and a better price than buying from John."
