"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me.  I'm thinking more along the lines of $600,000.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $600,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000.  That's still a good price for you, considering the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still a big gap for me. I can go up to $700,000 if that works for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$700,000 is still far too low for me. I'm going to counteroffer again, but I'm starting to get worried about losing this deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go that low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to sell for $1,000,000.  That's a good deal for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer.  $1,000,000 is still a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $750,000? That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While we're getting closer, $750,000 is still too low. I'm concerned about John's offer, but I'm going to try and squeeze a little more out of Bob before I make my final decision."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really want to make this deal work with you, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $900,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good compromise for both of us. I'm hoping you can agree to this offer."", ""product_price"": 900000}
