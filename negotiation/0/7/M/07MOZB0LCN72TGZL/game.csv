"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence! I'm willing to consider your offer, but I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my original price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value of the product to you, and I think it's a fair price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",825000.0,Alice,5,
