"While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  To make this work, I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and my budget.  I'm hopeful that we can reach an agreement. ",850000.0,Bob,4,
