"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,175,000. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,175,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. If this works for you, let's finalize the deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
