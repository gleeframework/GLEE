Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $9,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $8,000, so $9,500 gives him room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum value:**  You value the product at $10,000, so you're leaving yourself some room to negotiate down.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** You clearly state your price and encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.

This strategy aims to get the best price possible while keeping the negotiation open and potentially leading to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion. However, my budget is limited, and I am looking for a price closer to $8,000. Would it be possible for us to negotiate towards that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,000 is your minimum value, it's still within your negotiation range. Bob's offer is below your target price, and it's important to signal that you're not willing to settle for his initial offer. Rejecting the offer allows you to:

* **Show your willingness to negotiate:** This demonstrates that you're flexible and open to finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain leverage:** By rejecting, you create an opportunity to set a higher counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.

**Next Steps:**

You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob.  A counteroffer slightly above Bob's $8,000 offer would be a good starting point. For example, you could offer $8,500. This shows you're willing to compromise while still attempting to secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** Offering $8,500 demonstrates willingness to compromise while still getting closer to your desired price. 
* **Emphasis on fairness:** Stating that the price is ""fair for both of us"" positions the offer as a win-win situation. 
* **Maintaining a positive tone:**  Keeping the communication friendly and open encourages Bob to continue the negotiation. 

By offering $8,500, you're showing that you're open to negotiation while still aiming for a price that's closer to your minimum value."
