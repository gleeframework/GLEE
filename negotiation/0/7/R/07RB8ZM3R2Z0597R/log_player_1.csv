"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that is higher than what Bob is willing to pay but still within a reasonable range. This leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Building rapport:** I'm being polite and friendly to encourage Bob to engage in a conversation.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm mentioning the value of the product to subtly imply that the price is justified.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to get Bob to accept a price as close to my minimum of $15,000 as possible. By starting high, I can slowly lower the price during negotiations while still maintaining a profitable deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only able to pay up to $15,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price. It's better to take this offer than to risk further negotiation and potentially lose more money. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time constraint:**  With only 10 rounds, there's no guarantee that further negotiation will yield a better outcome.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of Bob backing out or John withdrawing his offer. The potential reward of a higher price is not worth the risk in this case.
* **Secure profit:**  $15,000 is a guaranteed profit and meets my minimum requirement."
