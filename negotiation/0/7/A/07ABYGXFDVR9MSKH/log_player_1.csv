Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I know you'll be thrilled with it."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, I can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Room for Negotiation:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards, closer to his perceived value of $8,000.
* **Confidence:**  Presenting a confident offer can influence Bob's perception of the product's value. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints. If I had more information about Bob, I might adjust my strategy accordingly."
