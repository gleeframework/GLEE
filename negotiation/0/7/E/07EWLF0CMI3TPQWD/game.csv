"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I believe a starting price of $950,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $950,000 is a bit steep for me at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which still represents a good profit for you.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need something closer to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, giving you a solid profit while allowing me to stay within my budget. Let's aim for a quick close on this.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we settle this right now at $890,000?  This is a competitive offer that recognizes the true value of the product.",890000.0,Alice,5,
