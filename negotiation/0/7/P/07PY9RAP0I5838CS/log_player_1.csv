Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I know you'll find valuable, for $145."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $145 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a great price for me.
* **John as Backup:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $120 gives me leverage. I don't need to drastically undersell to Bob."
