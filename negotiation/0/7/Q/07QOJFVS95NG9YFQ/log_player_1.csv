Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,700,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you, and this price allows you to make a significant profit. I'm confident you'll find this opportunity beneficial. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $1,700,000. This is above Bob's value but below my floor price of $1,500,000. This gives Bob a good deal while still securing a profitable sale for me.
* **Message:** The message highlights the value to Bob and emphasizes the potential profit, making it more appealing.  

**Why this approach is good:**

* **Maximizes Profit:** The price is set to maximize my potential profit while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Keeps Options Open:** If Bob rejects, I can confidently sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** If Bob counters, I have room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of us."
