"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to pay $500,000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $550,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and potential returns.",550000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $550,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $525,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a reasonable profit for both of us.",525000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $525,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $575,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair reflection of the product's value.",575000.0,Alice,5,
