"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering the product, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $10,500? It's a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to pay a bit less, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $11,000? It's a fair compromise that I think we can both be happy with.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,750? This is a fair compromise and allows us to both walk away satisfied.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so how about $11,250? I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and meets your budget.",11250.0,Alice,5,
