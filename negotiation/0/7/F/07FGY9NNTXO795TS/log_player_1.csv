Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $115.  I think this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $100.  I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $100 is simply too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $107.50 is very close to my desired price.  While I could try to push for a bit more, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could risk losing the deal entirely.  At this point, it's better to accept and secure a sale."
