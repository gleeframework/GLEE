"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  You can potentially get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still potentially securing a good deal for you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer of $11,000 is a good price. It's lower than her previous offer of $12,000 and significantly cheaper than John's $15,000.  There is no guarantee that you can get a better price in future rounds, so accepting this offer is the most sensible choice."
