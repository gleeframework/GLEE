"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a great product for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum value. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if necessary.
* **Positive message:** I'm starting with a friendly and positive message to build rapport. 
* **Open to negotiation:**  My message implies I'm open to negotiating, which can encourage Bob to make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get more.
* **Negotiation is possible:** Bob's message indicates he's willing to negotiate. This gives me an opportunity to counter with a higher price. 
* **More rounds available:**  I still have 9 rounds to try and get a better price before I have to settle for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $100 is definitely below my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $125? Let's find a price we're both happy with."", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable decrease:** I'm reducing the price by $25, showing willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm using a friendly tone, indicating I'm open to reaching an agreement. 
* **Focus on finding a mutually beneficial price:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a search for a price that works for both of us, emphasizing the potential for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Can you try to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:**  While $110 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for Bob to increase his offer.
* **Wanting a better price:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my initial asking price, and I'm confident I can get it through further negotiation.
* **Time remaining:**  I have 6 rounds left, which is enough time to explore more negotiation possibilities."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $117.50. This is a fair price considering the product's value.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 117.50} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm proposing a price exactly in the middle of my previous offer and Bob's current offer. This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Open-ended question:**  I'm ending with a question to encourage Bob to respond and keep the negotiation moving."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $117.50. Can you try to meet me at $115? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** $115 is only $5 below my initial asking price and only $15 above my minimum.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I reject Bob's offer, there's a chance he might walk away entirely. I'm unsure if he'll make any further counteroffers.
* **Limited time:**  I have only 4 rounds left. The risk of not selling to Bob and having to settle for John's offer is becoming more significant."
