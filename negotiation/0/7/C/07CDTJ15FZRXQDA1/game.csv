"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $85? ",85.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concern, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $85. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $87? It's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",87.0,Alice,3,
