Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $600000 is significantly lower than my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering your minimum value and my maximum budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
