"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is no less than $800000.",600000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $600000 is significantly lower than my budget. Given the value you've mentioned, I'm willing to pay $700000 for the product. This is a fair compromise considering your minimum value and my maximum budget. What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, considering the value I've placed on the product, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell it to you for $725000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $725000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. I'm ready to go to $710000 for the product. This is a serious offer that demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement on this final price.",710000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $710000 is a serious offer, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, given the value I've placed on the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell it to you for $737500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also acknowledging your budget constraints. What do you think?",737500.0,Alice,5,
