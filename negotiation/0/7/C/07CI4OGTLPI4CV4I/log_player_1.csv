"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point. Even though it's above Bob's perceived value, it gives us room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price significantly above our minimum.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""value"" and ""potential"" without being overly specific. This allows Bob to justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is positive and suggests a willingness to find a deal, making Bob more likely to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below our minimum. We have ample room for negotiation and a good alternative with John. Rejecting keeps the negotiation open. 

**Strategy for Round 3:**  We'll make a counteroffer significantly lower than our initial price but still above both Bob's offer and our minimum. This signals flexibility while maintaining a strong position."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. While I recognize the value you see in the product, my original pricing reflects its true potential and market demand.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this price point strikes a balance, offering significant value for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Drop:**  A $150,000 reduction from our initial offer shows flexibility and encourages Bob to reciprocate. 
* **Above Target and Bob's Offer:**  The new price keeps us above our minimum and Bob's offer, leaving space for further negotiation.
* **Value Emphasis:**  We're subtly shifting the focus from Bob's perceived value to the broader ""market demand"" to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Concession:** Bob is moving slowly, only increasing his offer by $50,000. This suggests he has more room to move.
* **Time as Leverage:** We still have plenty of rounds left. John's offer provides a safety net, allowing us to play a slightly longer game with Bob.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** Rejecting shows we're serious about getting a price closer to our target. 

**Strategy for Round 5:** We'll make another relatively small concession to show some movement but maintain a price well above Bob's current offer. We'll also start introducing a sense of urgency."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be realistic about this deal. I'm willing to consider $1,075,000. However, I also have other interested parties and need to make a decision soon. I believe this offer is fair and represents my final position.  "",
""product_price"": 1075000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reduced Concession:**  A $75,000 reduction is smaller than our last, signaling that we're reaching our limit.
* **Above $1 Million Mark:**  Maintaining a price above $1 million creates a psychological barrier and reinforces the product's high value.
* **Urgency and ""Final Offer"":**  Introducing a sense of urgency and framing this as our ""final position"" puts pressure on Bob to act decisively. We're not explicitly threatening to walk away (yet), but the message is clear."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to pay $1,075,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market demand. I'm willing to make a final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiation:** Bob is moving too slowly.  He increased his offer by only $25,000, and his ""final offer"" language doesn't hold much weight at this point. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob comes with the risk that we won't reach an agreement above John's offer. We've made significant concessions, and Bob hasn't reciprocated sufficiently.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's offer guarantees us our minimum acceptable price. It eliminates further negotiation and the risk of walking away with nothing.

**It's time to cut our losses with Bob and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.**"
