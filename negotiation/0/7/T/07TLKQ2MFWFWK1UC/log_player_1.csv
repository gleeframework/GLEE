**Reasoning:**

While holding out for a higher price is tempting, Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is a significant profit above my minimum ($1,200,000). Continuing to negotiate risks:

* **Bob lowering his offer:** He's already shown willingness to negotiate, but his increments are getting smaller. 
* **Losing the deal:**  There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, and I risk losing him entirely, forcing me to settle for John's lower offer.

Accepting $1,325,000 secures a substantial profit and avoids the potential downsides of further negotiation."
