"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1400000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Considering my maximum budget is $1200000, I'm willing to offer you $1300000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us. Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1300000 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which is a compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
