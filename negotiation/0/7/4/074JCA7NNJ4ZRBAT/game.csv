"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is good, $10,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $7,000.  Would you be willing to meet at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
