"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I'm a serious buyer and ready to close the deal if the price is right.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy. ",110.0,Alice,5,
