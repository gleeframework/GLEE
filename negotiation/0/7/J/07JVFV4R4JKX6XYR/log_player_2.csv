"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm asking $130 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $130 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $100? I'm a serious buyer and ready to close the deal if the price is right."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $115 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $105? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $105 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet at $110? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away happy.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is a $10 savings from her original price and a reasonable compromise.  While we might be able to negotiate a little further, there's a risk that she'll become firmer in her price or we might waste valuable rounds.  Getting the product for $110 meets our goal of saving money while still acquiring the item."
