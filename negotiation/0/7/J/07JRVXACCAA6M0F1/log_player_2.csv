"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I think you'll find it's a fantastic deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.
* Buying from John for $10,000 is a worse deal than Alice's initial offer. 
* By rejecting, Bob can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $9,500 is a bit high for me. How about $8,800?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $9,100? It's a high-quality product that I'm sure you'll be happy with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,100.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has come down from $9,500 to $9,100, which is closer to Bob's desired price. 
* While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject his counteroffer, and he would be forced to buy from John at a higher price ($10,000).
* Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price he's comfortable with while minimizing risk."
