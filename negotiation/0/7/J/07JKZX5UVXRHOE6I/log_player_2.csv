"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is less than Bob's maximum budget, there's potential for a better deal. Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to explore lower prices through counteroffers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'd need to see the price closer to $10,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a lower price that's still reasonable for him. This strong opening counteroffer puts pressure on Alice to negotiate.  It also signals Bob's seriousness about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob can likely still get a better deal. Rejecting allows him to continue negotiating and see if he can push Alice further down. It's worth exploring if there's more room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm getting closer, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a smaller counteroffer this time, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price.  He's staying firm on his position, but also acknowledging Alice's concessions. The message reinforces that Bob is serious about finding a deal while staying within his budget."
