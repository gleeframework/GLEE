"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget.  While I'm interested, I'd need to see the price closer to $10,000 to make this work for me.  Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I had in mind.  Could we perhaps meet in the middle at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. While I'm getting closer, $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $11,000?  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
