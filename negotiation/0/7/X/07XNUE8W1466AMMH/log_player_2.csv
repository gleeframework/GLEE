"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. The product is only worth $12,000 to me, so I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However,  $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would only be willing to pay $10,000."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to bring the price down significantly.  It's a starting point for negotiation, and I'm prepared to adjust my offer upwards depending on Alice's response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice moved closer to my desired price, $13,500 is still more than I'm willing to pay. I'll continue negotiating and try to get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $13,500 is closer to what I had in mind, but it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

This counter-offer keeps the negotiation moving and shows Alice I'm willing to meet her closer to the middle ground, but I'm still aiming to stay as close to my $12,000 limit as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can meet you at $12,800. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting very close to my limit, but it's still above what John is offering. I'll make one more counter-offer that's just slightly above John's price to see if Alice will budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you've been great to work with, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm ready to make a final offer of $12,100. This is my absolute limit, and I think it's a very fair price for both of us."", 
""product_price"": 12100
}
```

This counter-offer is my best and final. It's slightly above John's price, showing Alice I'm serious, but still allows me to save some money if she accepts. If she declines, I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm afraid I've already gone as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but no lower. This is the best I can do. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500

Alice is unwilling to meet my price point. It's time to cut my losses and go with John, who's offering the product at my target price."
