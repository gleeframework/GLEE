"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum desired price of $1,200,000, but it gives Bob a good starting point for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to come up at all from his perceived value of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can get closer to my goal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000. This is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe this shows good faith while still allowing for some room to negotiate in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still too far away. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 920000} 
```

I'm offering $920,000. This is a smaller increment than before, showing that I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm trying to signal to Bob that I'm serious about a deal but also that I won't be budging much further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. While I'm getting closer to a deal with Bob, the negotiations are taking time, and I'm concerned that we might not reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. I'm confident that John will buy the product for my minimum desired price, and that's the most important thing for me right now."
