"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you be open to discussing that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $15000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13500, which is a great compromise. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fantastic deal. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $11000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're willing to go up to $11000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable selling it to you for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I can do $12200, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",12200.0,Alice,5,
