"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** Bob's goal is to spend no more than $800,000.  $900,000 is over his budget.
* **Negotiation is possible:** It's worth exploring if Alice is willing to come down in price. 
* **John is an option:**  Knowing John is willing to sell for $800,000 gives Bob leverage in the negotiation."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is valuable, but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While it's closer to Bob's budget, $875,000 is still above his target of $800,000.
* **John remains a viable option:** Bob knows he can buy the product from John for $800,000.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** There's room for further negotiation to get closer to Bob's target price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $862,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying your product, but I need to stay within my financial limits.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 862500}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's coming down in price, $880,000 is still above Bob's target of $800,000.
* **John remains a safe alternative:** Bob knows he can get the product from John for a price that's within his budget. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, so there's still room for further negotiation.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still committed to acquiring this product, but $880,000 is pushing the limits of my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm offering $870,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $870,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While she's come down further, $885,000 is still more than Bob's target of $800,000.
* **John offers a better deal:**  Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John, who will sell the product for $800,000. 
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield a better result:**  Alice has made it clear she's not willing to go lower than $885,000, and Bob is unlikely to be able to convince her to change her mind.

Given the limited number of rounds remaining and the availability of a lower price from John, it's in Bob's best interest to secure the product from John and avoid risking further negotiation with Alice."
