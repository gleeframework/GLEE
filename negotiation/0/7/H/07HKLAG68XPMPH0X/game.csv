"Alice, your product is valuable, but $900,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while remaining within my budget. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $875,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still outside my budget. Let's split the difference.  I'm offering $862,500. This is a compromise that shows I'm serious about buying your product, but I need to stay within my financial limits.  Let's make this deal happen.",862500.0,Bob,4,
