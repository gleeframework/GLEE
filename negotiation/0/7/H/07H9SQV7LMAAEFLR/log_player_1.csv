Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $15,000, so I won't sell for less.
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values it at $10,000.
* **John's Value:** John is my backup buyer at $15,000.
* **My Strategy:** I'm aiming for the highest possible price while still being attractive to Bob.  Offering $14,000 gives Bob a $4,000 gain over his perceived value, which is a decent incentive. 
* **Risk:**  There's a chance Bob will reject the offer, but I'm confident that John will purchase it for my minimum price."
