"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $10,000. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is better than $12,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate it. I'm really interested, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $9,000?  I think that would be a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $9,000 is a bit of a stretch for you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $9,500. I think it's a fair compromise that will work for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Alice has lowered her price to $9,500, which is still within Bob's budget and a better deal than buying from John for $12,000. Accepting this offer is the most financially beneficial choice."
