"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows the sale to happen. ",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll come down to $1,050,000. This is my absolute lowest price. If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is your final opportunity. If not, I will be moving on to another buyer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
