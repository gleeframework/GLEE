{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $800,000 to you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's valuation but significantly lower than your minimum:** This gives Bob a good reason to consider the offer, while still leaving you with a substantial profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects, you have room to come down a bit, but you're still far from your minimum acceptable price.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings while still making the deal attractive enough for Bob.  We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's responses."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'm not desperate for a quick sale, and John is still waiting in the wings with a much better offer. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob, but I'm not afraid to walk away if he doesn't meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be closer to my initial offer.  How about $1,100,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows the sale to happen. "", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

This counteroffer is:

* **A compromise:** It's a step down from my initial offer but still well above Bob's offer.
* **Fair:** It offers Bob a significant discount from what I initially wanted while still guaranteeing a reasonable profit for me.
* **Motivating:** I'm signaling a willingness to negotiate but also establishing a clear limit. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a little closer to what I want, it's still a significant loss for me. I'm not willing to settle for such a low price when I know I can get much more from John.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer, but if Bob doesn't budge, I'm walking away and selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $950,000 is still too far off for me. I'm willing to make one final concession. I'll come down to $1,050,000. This is my absolute lowest price. If you're serious about purchasing the product, this is your final opportunity. If not, I will be moving on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

This final counteroffer:

* **Is firm:**  I'm making it clear that this is my absolute bottom line.
* **Offers a reasonable compromise:** I'm coming down significantly from my previous offer, but still maintaining a profit.
* **Creates urgency:**  I'm emphasizing that this is the last chance for Bob to purchase the product at this price.

Now it's up to Bob. Will he take the deal, or will he walk away and leave me to sell to John?"
