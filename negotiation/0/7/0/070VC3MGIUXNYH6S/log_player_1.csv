"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 matches your minimum acceptable price, you have the opportunity to sell to John for the same amount immediately.  There's no guarantee you'll be able to negotiate a higher price with Bob, and further negotiation carries the risk of him lowering his offer or the deal falling through. Selling to John guarantees you reach your minimum desired profit without further risk or delay."
