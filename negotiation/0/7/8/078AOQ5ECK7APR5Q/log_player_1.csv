"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a significant profit. If Bob rejects, I'll have room to negotiate.  I'll keep an eye on the clock and be prepared to walk away if the deal isn't moving fast enough or if it looks like I won't get a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's a decent price, I'm aiming for more than $1,200,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  I'll keep a close eye on the rounds remaining and be prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm countering with $1,350,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a profit.  If Bob rejects, I'll have more room to negotiate, but I'll be mindful of the remaining rounds and my potential deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price.  I'll counteroffer again, but I'll be watching the clock closely. I'm starting to feel the pressure of the remaining rounds, and I might have to consider selling to John if I don't get a satisfactory deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm countering again with $1,250,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit. This is a fair middle ground, and I hope Bob will see it that way. If he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John as we are running out of rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better price. We're nearing the end of the negotiations, and I'm not sure if I'll get a better offer from Bob. I'm seriously considering selling to John to guarantee a sale. I'll see if Bob will meet me in the middle in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1175000} 
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm meeting him halfway, but I'm not willing to go lower. I'm aware that time is running out, and if he rejects this offer, I'll be forced to sell to John for $1,000,000. It's a difficult decision, but I need to ensure I get at least a decent profit from this deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000.  Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but the risk of not closing a deal at all is too high.  It's not the ideal outcome, but it guarantees a sale and keeps me from losing out completely."
