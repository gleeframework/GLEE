"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to budge.  I'm also leaving some room to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway and offer him the product for $15,000. This is my minimum price and I believe it's a fair compromise."
