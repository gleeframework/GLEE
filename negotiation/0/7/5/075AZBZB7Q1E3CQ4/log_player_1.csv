{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

This offer starts in the middle ground, giving Bob a sense of getting a good deal while still allowing me to profit significantly. It's also a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is more than what John is offering, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price point of $120. I'll counter Bob's offer to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? That way we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit high for me. How about we try $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I want to see if I can get closer to $100.  I'll counter Bob's offer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, and I'm happy to meet you halfway. How about $105?  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 105}
