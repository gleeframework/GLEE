"Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. The product is worth $120 to her, and she's offering it to me for $140, which is higher than what I'm willing to pay. I can get it from John for $150, so I'll reject Alice's offer.
