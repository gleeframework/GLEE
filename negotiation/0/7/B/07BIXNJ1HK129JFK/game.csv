"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, but I'm still not willing to let go of the product for that price. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise that takes into account your willingness to pay a premium for the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. How about we settle on $875,000? This price is closer to my ideal and still allows you a healthy profit. Let's make this deal happen.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $875,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to give up on the deal just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $885,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
