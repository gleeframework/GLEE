"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Can you consider that?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm sure you'll still get a good deal at that price.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to offer $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  However, $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,200 for the product. Can you consider that?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,600.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on.",10600.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $10,400 for the product. It's my last offer, and I hope you can consider it.",10400.0,Bob,8,
