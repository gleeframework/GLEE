"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This is a starting point that is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable value. It gives Bob room to negotiate while still being a good deal for me.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and direct. I highlight the value to Bob while leaving room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price.  I'm confident I can get a higher offer from Bob or from John if I have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is just too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  I'm sure you'll still get a good deal at that price."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,500:** This is a compromise,  It's a significant increase from Bob's offer but still lower than my initial offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to drop too low.
* **Message:** I'm remaining polite but firm.  I reiterate that $9,000 isn't acceptable while offering a specific counteroffer for consideration."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to offer $9,800 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is slightly better than his previous one, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value. It's also not a good deal considering I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating, hoping for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to work with you.  However, $9,800 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's make this happen.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:**  This counteroffer is a further compromise, showing flexibility while still remaining above my minimum acceptable value. It allows for a potential deal with Bob without jeopardizing my minimum profit.
* **Message:** I am maintaining a positive and encouraging tone, focusing on reaching a deal. I am emphasizing my willingness to compromise while setting a clear price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to offer $10,200 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $10,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still not enough to justify selling it to him.  I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $15,000. I'll continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm ready to sell to John if a better deal doesn't materialize."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,200.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,600.  This is my final offer.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to move on."", ""product_price"": 10600}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,600:** This is a further compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It signifies a willingness to finalize a deal with Bob while minimizing my potential losses.
* **Message:** I'm using a strong tone by stating it's my final offer. This creates urgency and potentially encourages Bob to accept. I also highlight the possibility of going to John if a deal isn't made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand this is your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to offer $10,400 for the product. It's my last offer, and I hope you can consider it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,400 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, but it's still not enough to justify selling to him. We're approaching the end of our negotiation rounds, and I need to make a decision. Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $15,000, it's simply not worth it to continue negotiating with Bob. The risk of getting a lower price or not reaching a deal at all outweighs the potential gain of a few more dollars.  It's time to move on to a sure thing with John."
