"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your desired price point, the value this product offers is truly reflected in my initial price.  I could meet you halfway at $13,500.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

You should accept Alice's offer.  She has come down to $13,500, which is a good price for you since you value the product at $15,000.  Any further negotiation could risk losing the deal and having to buy from John for $15,000."
