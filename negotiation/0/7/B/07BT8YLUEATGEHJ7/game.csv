"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you.  I'm initially offering it at $2,250,000. What are your thoughts?",2250000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $2,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its worth to me. What do you think?",1750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,750,000 is a respectable offer, I'm confident this product's value justifies a higher price point.  How about we meet halfway at $2,000,000?",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $2,000,000 is still a bit out of my range. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm prepared to offer $1,850,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm willing to be flexible. How about we split the difference and settle at $1,925,000?  This represents a significant discount on my initial asking price and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions. ",1850000.0,Bob,6,
