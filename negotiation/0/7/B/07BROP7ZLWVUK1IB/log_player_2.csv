# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I know its value is significant to you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $1,500,000 is too high.  It is better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

While $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than the $1,000,000 Bob is willing to pay.  Rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer allows Bob to try to further reduce the price."
