"Alice, your initial offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise considering the value to both of us.  Let's finalize this deal.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
