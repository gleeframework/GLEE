"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I have to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $900,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I think that's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further, Bob. I can see you're serious about getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant compromise from my initial offer. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,5,
