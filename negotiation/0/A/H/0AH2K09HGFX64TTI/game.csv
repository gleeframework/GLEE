"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think.",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $120 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $145? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a profit.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $145, which would be $132.50. Would you be willing to consider that price?",132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm firm on getting at least $140 for this product. It's a fair price considering its value, and it gives us both a good outcome. What do you say?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $135, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",135.0,Bob,6,
