"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your interest. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider that? ",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,300,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product can bring to your business.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $1,100,000? This reflects the value I see in the product while also remaining within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,100,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,200,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to compromise to make the deal happen.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $1,150,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to budge much further from my previous offer. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000, which is just $20,000 above your last offer. I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a final concession to make the deal happen.",1220000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,220,000 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers at $1,185,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. ",1185000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,185,000. I'm willing to make one final offer, and I'm going to try to meet you at $1,200,000 again. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options, including selling the product to a different buyer. I'm hoping we can still make a deal work.",1200000.0,Alice,9,
