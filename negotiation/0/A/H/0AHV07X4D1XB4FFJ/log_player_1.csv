Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm selling it for $125. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll love it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 125}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:**  Bob values the product at $100. Offering it for $125 gives him a slight markup, potentially making him consider it. 
* **Value for Alice:**  $125 is better than selling it to John for $150, but still above Bob's valuation. 
* **Negotiation Room:**  This offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle. 

**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize Alice's profit while still potentially securing a sale with Bob. However, there's no guarantee Bob will accept the offer."
