"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $125.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $125 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? That's still a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. That's the highest I'm willing to go.,130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price, and I appreciate that. I'm only willing to go down to $132. This would allow me to still make a decent profit while being fair to you. What do you say?",132.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $132 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $129. This is my final offer, so please let me know if it's acceptable.",129.0,Bob,6,
