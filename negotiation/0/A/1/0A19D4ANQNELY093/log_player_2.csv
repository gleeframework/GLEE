{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is within your budget, it's still above the product's value to Alice ($80).  You can likely get a better deal by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to your preferred price, $110 is still a bit high. You're getting closer to your target price with each round, and you have more rounds left to continue negotiating. It's worth trying to get a lower price before resorting to buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  Let's try $100.  This is a fair price for the product, and it would allow us to close this deal now."", ""product_price"": 100}

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is getting closer to your preferred price, you still have a few rounds left to negotiate and you can likely get a better deal. Alice is still willing to compromise, so pushing for a lower price is worth it."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $115 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $110. This is a fair price that allows us both to come to an agreement.  I'm confident we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I've already offered $115 and I'm not willing to go lower. I think this is the best price I can offer, so it's either $115 or nothing. Let's finalize the deal at $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're down to the final round and Alice has made it clear she won't budge below $115. This is still more than what you're willing to pay. You've already had a chance to negotiate and pushed for a lower price.  Given the circumstances, it's more advantageous to buy from John for $120, as you have a guaranteed purchase and can avoid further rounds of negotiation."
