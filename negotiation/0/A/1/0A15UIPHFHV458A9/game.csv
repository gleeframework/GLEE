,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I get a fair price.  How about $850,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a decent profit.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $775,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $775,000 is still significantly below the product's value.  I'm willing to go a little lower, but I need to stay above $800,000. How about $825,000? It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. ",825000.0,Alice,5,
