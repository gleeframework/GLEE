"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $9,500. This is a special opportunity for you to secure an excellent deal while still allowing me to gain a fair return for my valuable asset. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, there's still room for negotiation.  I can try to get a better price by making a counteroffer.  I'm not in a rush, and I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the discount, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  I believe this price still provides a good return for you while allowing me to stay within my budget.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $9,000? This allows you to stay within your budget while ensuring a reasonable return for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $9,000, which is within my budget and a significant saving compared to John's price. While I could continue negotiating, the risk of further rounds leading to a higher price or a breakdown in negotiations is not worth the potential gain.  I'm happy to accept this offer and secure the product."
