Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $120. This is a fair price considering it's worth $150 to him and more than my minimum acceptable price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $100 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob at $110. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, and still a good deal for both of us."
