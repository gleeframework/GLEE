"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer to get us started. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer is $12,000, which is above Bob's maximum budget of $10,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's offer of $11,000 is still above his budget of $10,000. Even though he is getting closer to his desired price, it's better to keep negotiating and see if he can get a lower price. It's also worth considering that if he rejects this offer, he can buy the product from John for $10,000, so he has a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm really hoping to get this product for $10,000. If you're willing to go that low, we have a deal! "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $10,000, as that's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $11,500 for it. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still above Bob's budget of $10,000. At this point, Bob is better off buying the product from John for $10,000. He has already made several counteroffers and Alice has shown a reluctance to go lower.  Further negotiation could lead to a lower price, but it's also risky since Bob could end up with no deal and have to pay John's $10,000 price.  It's a calculated risk, but given the limited rounds, buying from John provides a guaranteed deal at a reasonable price."
