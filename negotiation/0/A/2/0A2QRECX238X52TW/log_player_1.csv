Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120. It's a great deal for you and a fair price for me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $120, which is significantly higher than my minimum price of $80. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I'm not giving away too much value right off the bat.
* **Appealing to Bob:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for him, highlighting his potential gain from purchasing at this price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $120 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$100 is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price of $80, it's still below the value I'm comfortable accepting.
* **Potential for higher negotiation:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can continue to negotiate and potentially secure a price closer to my desired range.
* **Avoiding a rushed sale:** Selling to John immediately would guarantee a sale but at a significantly lower price than I could potentially get from Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few more negotiation rounds to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's fair for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price from $120 to $110. 
* **Maintaining value:** $110 is still above my minimum price of $80, ensuring I don't lose out on significant value.
* **Appealing to Bob:**  I'm highlighting the ""good deal"" he'll get at this price, encouraging him to accept. 
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm still open to discussing a price if Bob is hesitant, leaving room for a potential final agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd be willing to pay $105 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $105 is only $5 away from my minimum price of $80. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a higher price, but there's also a chance Bob might walk away.
* **Guaranteed sale:** Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale at a price that is reasonable and still a good profit for me.
* **Time factor:**  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars, it might not be worth the time and effort if it risks losing the deal altogether."
