"Round 1

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Alice is offering it for $15,000. This is significantly higher than your desired price.  It makes sense to reject this offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still higher than my maximum value of $12,000. This allows room for negotiation and hopefully shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but at a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum value of $12,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I can still potentially get a better price.  I also have the option of buying from John for $12,000 if I reach an impasse with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's offer and closer to my maximum value. This is a good middle ground to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high for me. I'm willing to keep negotiating, especially since I can still buy the product from John for my maximum value of $12,000.  I believe there's still room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing flexibility and demonstrating that I'm still interested in buying the product. This offer is only slightly above my maximum value, but it's a good compromise point. If Alice rejects this offer, it's very likely I'll buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum value of $12,000. I believe there's still room to negotiate and reach a deal that's more favorable to me. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation, as I can always buy from John for $12,000 if we can't reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm going to stick with my last counteroffer of $12,500. This is a good compromise point. If she accepts, I get a good deal. If she rejects, I'll buy from John.  There's only a couple of rounds left, so I need to make a firm offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,800.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum value of $12,000.  With only one round left, there isn't enough time to negotiate further, and I don't want to risk losing the product.  I'm going to buy from John, as I know I can get the product at my desired price."
