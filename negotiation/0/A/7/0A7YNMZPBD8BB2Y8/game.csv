"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree the product is valuable, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price. While $950,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about $750,000? That's a significant jump from my last offer and shows I'm serious about making a deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.",875000.0,Alice,5,
