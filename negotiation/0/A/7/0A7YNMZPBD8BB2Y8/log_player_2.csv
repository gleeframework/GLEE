Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $900,000. I'm willing to make a small concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'll offer it to you for $875,000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below this price.

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down in price, but she's still asking for more than John's guaranteed price. At this point, it's too risky to continue negotiating with Alice. She might not go low enough, and we'd be stuck paying more than we need to.  Buying from John guarantees the best price and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
