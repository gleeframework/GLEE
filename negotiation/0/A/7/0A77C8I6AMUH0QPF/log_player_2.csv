"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product that I believe would greatly benefit you. After careful consideration of its worth and your potential needs, I propose a transaction price of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects not only its intrinsic value but also allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I look forward to discussing this further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is below her perceived value, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000 and John's offer. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or sticking with your backup plan of buying from John."
