"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate down.
* **Reasoning:**  I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,800. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $8,800 is better than Bob's initial $8,000, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  I need to push for a higher price. I will counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,800 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,200, which is still a good deal considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, but I'm still staying above Bob's offer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm reiterating the product's value to encourage Bob to see the worth in my counteroffer.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm suggesting a compromise, creating a sense of urgency and pushing for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,200, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $8,500. Let's see if we can get closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,500 is still below my minimum threshold of $10,000. While it's tempting to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that's significantly lower than my product's value. I'll continue to negotiate and try to reach a price that's more acceptable to me.  I'm not quite ready to give up on getting closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still too far from what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers and propose $9,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, creating a sense of urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a compromise by meeting halfway between our last offers. This shows I'm willing to be flexible. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value, reminding Bob of its worth and justifying my price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to compromise and offer $8,200. Let's see if we can get even closer to a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $10,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price that's satisfactory to me.  Given the remaining rounds, it's more likely that Bob will continue to lowball me. 

It's time to cut my losses and sell the product to John for $10,000, ensuring that I meet my minimum goal and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
