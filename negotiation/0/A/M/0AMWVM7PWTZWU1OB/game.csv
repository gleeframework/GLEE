"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my asking price, I'm still looking to get a bit more for this product. How about we settle on $950,000? This would still provide you with a significant value, and it's a fair compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to stay within my limits.
