Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale. I think it's really valuable, so I'm starting the price at $160. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 160}
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** By starting at $160, there's a chance Bob might counteroffer somewhere above his $80 valuation but below your $120 minimum. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup willing to pay $120 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $160 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $80. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is far below your minimum acceptable price. You know you can get $120 from John. It's highly unlikely Bob will drastically increase his offer to even get close to your acceptable range. It's time to negotiate or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I understand your position, but $160 is based on the value I place on this product.  To make this work, I could go as low as $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility but Holding Firm:**  We're coming down from the initial price, showing we're willing to negotiate. However, the new price ($140) is still significantly above both Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to see if Bob is willing to move at all from his initial lowball offer. If he remains stuck at $80, it's likely not worth continuing the negotiation.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  You still have the option of selling to John for $120, so there's no pressure to accept a low offer from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still only able to go up to $80.  This is my final offer, as I can get the product for that price from someone else.  Let me know if you are willing to accept it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob is Firm:** Bob has stated his final offer is $80, which is significantly below your minimum of $120.
* **No Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's message indicates he won't budge and has an alternative option at his desired price.
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price.

Continuing to negotiate with Bob is unlikely to result in a better outcome. It's time to cut your losses and make the guaranteed sale to John."
