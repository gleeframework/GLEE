"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This represents a significant opportunity for you, as you value it at the same amount. I'm confident this is a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts.",1050000.0,Alice,1,
