Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I can do better. I'll see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $105? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $105 is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $100?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer more, $100 is a good price and I don't want to risk losing the sale completely."
