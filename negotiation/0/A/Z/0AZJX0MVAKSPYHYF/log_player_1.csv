Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. This is a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation and potential profit for you. If Bob rejects it, you can use the information from his counteroffer to adjust your strategy. Remember, you can always fall back on John's offer of $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I'm willing to negotiate further if you're open to it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your starting offer, and still below your minimum desired price of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob, as you might be able to reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to make a profit, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to your desired price than John's offer, and it's within the acceptable range considering Bob's perceived value of the product.  This ensures you get a good price while also securing a sale."
