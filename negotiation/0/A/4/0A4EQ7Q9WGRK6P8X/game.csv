"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal considering the value it will bring to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $18,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make a living, and $12,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $16,000. This is my final counteroffer, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $16,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending. I could go up to $13,000.  Beyond that, I'd have to consider my other options.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a profit. I'll sell it to you for $14,500. This is my last offer, and I hope you'll find it reasonable.",14500.0,Alice,5,
