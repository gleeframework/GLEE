"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already gone as low as I can.

This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product. What do you think?",18250.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $17500.

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm not willing to go any lower than $18000. I think this is a fair price for the product, considering its value and quality. If you're not willing to meet me at $18000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. I'm willing to sell the product to John for $15000, and I think he would be a good buyer. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,9,
