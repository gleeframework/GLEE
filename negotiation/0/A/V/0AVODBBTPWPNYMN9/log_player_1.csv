Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so Alice needs to offer a price lower than his maximum but higher than her minimum.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It also ensures a significant profit even if Bob negotiates the price down slightly.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale to John at her desired price.

This strategy balances maximizing profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
