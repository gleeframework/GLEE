"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique features and value, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,800,000. This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me, but $1,800,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with. To be honest, I can't justify going any higher than $700,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant reduction on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
