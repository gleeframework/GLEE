Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities.  To find a middle ground, I could let it go for $1,800,000. This reflects the true value while acknowledging your interest.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is still below what I hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000 as a final offer. This represents a significant reduction on my part and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000.

It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to come down to a price that works for you.  While she's making concessions, they aren't significant enough.  You have a firm backup option with John at $800,000, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice short and take that deal."
