"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go.  How about $13,000?  That's still a good deal for you, and it fits within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your offer, Bob.  However, I  know how valuable this product is and $13,000 is cutting it a bit close to my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
