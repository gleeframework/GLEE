"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. After careful consideration, we're willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the product's value to you. There's a lot of room for negotiation, and it's worth exploring a counteroffer to potentially save a significant amount of money."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to the product's actual value. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  This still represents a good deal for you, and it's within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After reconsidering, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still benefits both parties.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still above the product's value to her.  I can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,125,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're still a bit apart, but we're willing to make another concession. We're offering the product to you for $1,130,000. This is our final compromise, and we hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,130,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,130,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,130,000 is close enough to my counteroffer of $1,125,000 that it's worth accepting. It's a good deal for both of us and avoids the risk of further negotiations potentially leading to a stalemate or me having to buy from John at a much higher price."
