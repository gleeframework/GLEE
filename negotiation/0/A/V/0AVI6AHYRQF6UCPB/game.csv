"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70.",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $70 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $85? I'm willing to be flexible to close this deal.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $75 for the product, can you meet me at that price?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit more.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $80. This is my final offer.  If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",80.0,Alice,5,
