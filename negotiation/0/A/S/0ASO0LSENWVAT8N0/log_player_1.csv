Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1300000, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to pay $1225000 for the product, and I think that's a fair price considering the value it holds.

Round 10
Bob's offer:

It's clear that Bob isn't going to budge further. While $1,200,000 is a decent amount of money, it's less than I hoped for.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000. It's not ideal, but it's better than walking away with nothing."
