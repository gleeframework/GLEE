Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. It's a unique opportunity to acquire an asset of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob allows us to potentially get a price above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 creates a substantial profit margin while still positioning it below John's guaranteed offer. This price aims to:
    * **Entice Bob:**  It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive.
    * **Leave room for negotiation:** Bob might counter-offer, and we can potentially still settle above our minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  How we proceed depends on Bob's response. If he rejects the offer outright, we might consider a slightly lower counter-offer before going with John."
