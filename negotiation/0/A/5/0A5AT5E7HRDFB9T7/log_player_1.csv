Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $150. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum price of $120, giving me some room to negotiate if needed. Since I don't know Bob's valuation, this price allows for potential profit while also leaving space for a deal. If Bob rejects the offer, I can always fall back on John's offer of $120."
