"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 Alice's offer is higher than our budget. We can try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We are starting with a counter offer significantly lower than Alice's starting price.  This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below our budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but we can still try to get closer to our target price. We'll reject and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $90 is a big drop, Alice. How about $97? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",
""product_price"": 97
}
```

We are making a smaller counter offer now, showing willingness to compromise while inching closer to a price we find acceptable.  By stating we are ready to close the deal, it adds a bit of pressure for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $97 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  Would you consider $102? I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We are getting close, but Alice is clearly willing to negotiate. We'll reject this offer, but it might be time to consider buying from John if we can't get a slightly better deal soon."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, $102 is very close, but it's more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer you $99 as my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 99
}
``` 

We are giving Alice a final offer at $99. This is a small concession on our part, and the ""final offer"" language adds a sense of urgency.  If Alice rejects this, we should be prepared to walk away and buy from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're at your limit.  To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has met our target price of $100. There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John since we've achieved our goal."
