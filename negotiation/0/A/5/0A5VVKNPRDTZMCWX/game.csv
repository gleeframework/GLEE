"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $105?  I'm confident you'll find this a good value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a big drop, Alice. How about $97? That's a fair compromise, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",97.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility. While $97 is closer, I'm still unable to go that low.  Would you consider $102? I believe this price is still fair for both of us, and I'm confident you'll agree.",102.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, $102 is very close, but it's more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to offer you $99 as my final offer. If you can't accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",99.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're at your limit.  To close this deal, I'm willing to come down to $100. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let me know if you're willing to accept.",100.0,Alice,7,
