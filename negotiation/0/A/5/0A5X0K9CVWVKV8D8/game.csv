,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $125. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $135? I think that's a fair compromise.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $135 is closer, but I'm still a little high.  How about we split the difference again and go with $130? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to finalize the deal.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to a decision, but I'm still not comfortable going below $135. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $132.50? It's a small step down, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",132.5,Alice,5,
