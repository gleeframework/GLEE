"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $1000000 to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. This price still reflects the product's unique value and potential.  Let's continue the discussion and see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, and I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1000000. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
