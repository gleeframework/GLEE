Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I think this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you highlighting the product's unique value. While I'm interested, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $600000 for it. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. $750000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to go up to $700000.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $700000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725000. This is my final counteroffer, so I hope you'll consider it.",725000.0,Alice,5,
