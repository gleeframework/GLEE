"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $120 for the product. Alice's offer of $100 is better than John's offer of $120. However, there's room for negotiation as the product is only worth $80 to Alice. Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

**Explanation:** 

This counteroffer represents a compromise. It's lower than Alice's initial offer, but still higher than what the product is worth to her. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, while also ensuring you get a better price than John's offer."
