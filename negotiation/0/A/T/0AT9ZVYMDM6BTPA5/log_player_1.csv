Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,200,000. Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you have leverage to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Creating a sense of value and urgency:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity, subtly pressuring Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup plan:** Mentioning ""other interested parties"" reminds Bob you have alternatives if he declines.

**Important:** While this offer aims high, be prepared to negotiate with Bob. Gauge his interest and be ready to adjust your price if needed to secure the deal, keeping your $800,000 minimum in mind."
