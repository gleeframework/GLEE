Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

This is a starting point for negotiation. I'm aiming high, knowing the product is worth at least $12,000 to me.  I'll see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway or if he has a lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$10,000 is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not going to accept that price right away. I'll counter with a higher offer and see where that goes."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer, but I'm still confident the product is worth more than $10,000. This counteroffer gives Bob some room to negotiate while still allowing me to get a decent price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is less than I initially hoped for, it's still a decent price.  I'd rather get a confirmed sale now than risk further negotiation and potentially end up with John's offer of $12,000."
