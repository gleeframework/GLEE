Round 2
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Explanation: 

At this point, Bob is offering our minimum acceptable price.  While we *could* try to push him a little higher in further rounds, there's no guarantee of success. It's strategically sound to take the guaranteed $800,000 from John rather than risk Bob walking away and getting stuck with a worse deal."
