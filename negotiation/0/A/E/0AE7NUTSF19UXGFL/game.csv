"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider coming down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $10,500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. I'm getting closer to my budget, but $10,500 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle at $10,000? It's a win-win for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: I'll sell the product to you for $11,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,5,
