"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product for a competitive price. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll appreciate its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high. I should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price?"", 
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $10,000 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price that's closer to your target, while still being a good deal for me. How about $8,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is coming down, but $8,250 is still closer to her value than mine. I'll make another counteroffer to try and meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice. How about we settle on $7,750?  That feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

This counteroffer splits the difference between her previous offer ($8250) and my previous counteroffer ($7000). It shows I'm willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your target, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $7,900, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice seems firm on her price, and $7,900 is a reasonable deal. It's a significant saving compared to John's offer, and further haggling might risk losing the opportunity."
