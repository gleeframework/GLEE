Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I believe a price of $925,000 is fair. This gives you a significant discount while ensuring a good return for me. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and you can still likely settle above your $800,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides Bob with a reason for the high price, making it more palatable. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response."
