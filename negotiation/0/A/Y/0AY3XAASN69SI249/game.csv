"Hello Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product and your confidence in its value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,600,000 asking price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,450,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget limitations. While $1,450,000 is a tempting offer, it's unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price point. I'm willing to compromise, however, and offer the product for $1,550,000. This price reflects the product's true value and allows us to both achieve a satisfactory outcome. Let's find common ground!",1550000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate your offer of $1,550,000. While it's closer to what I can afford, I still need to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,525,000. I hope this revised proposal will help us reach an agreement that suits both of our needs.",1525000.0,Bob,4,
