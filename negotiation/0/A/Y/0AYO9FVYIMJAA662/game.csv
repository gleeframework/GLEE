"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than its value to you. Let me know what you think!",95.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $85 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This still gives you a good deal and allows me to get closer to what the product is worth to me. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $90, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $87? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make a reasonable offer.",87.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to continue negotiating. However, $87 is still a bit below what I need to get. How about we split the difference and settle on $88.50? This way we can both walk away happy.",88.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87 and $88.50, which would be $88.25. Would you be willing to accept that price?",88.25,Bob,6,
