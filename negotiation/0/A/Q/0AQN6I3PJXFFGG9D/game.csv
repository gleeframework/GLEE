"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. To be honest,  $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I see in the product.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? That feels like a fair deal for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $775,000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up too much. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $775,000, which would be $787,500. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you.",787500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, you've been very patient, and I respect your position.  How about we make this our final exchange?  I'm willing to offer $780,000. If that doesn't work, I think I'll have to explore other options.",780000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $785,000, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I think this is a fair price, considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to end the negotiation here.",785000.0,Alice,9,
