Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm asking for $150, but willing to negotiate a fair deal."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to start with an offer higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed while maximizing potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly mentions willingness to negotiate, signaling to Bob that there's flexibility in the price.
* **Not Too High:** While starting high is important, an unreasonable initial offer might discourage Bob from further negotiation. $150 is a significant markup but not outrageous, given that the product is worth $100 to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is a bit too high for me. How about $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $75 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and his own valuation of the product ($100). Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for you. It's clear there's room for negotiation.  You'll make a counteroffer closer to your desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $75 is significantly below what I can accept. This product is valuable, and I'm confident it's worth more to you as well. How about we meet halfway at $112? "", 
""product_price"": 112
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejection Followed by Justification:** By clearly stating that $75 is unacceptable and explaining why the product is worth more, you signal firmness without being confrontational.
* **Compromise:** Offering to ""meet halfway"" presents an image of fairness and encourages Bob to engage in a more reasonable negotiation.
* **Targeting Above Minimum:**  The $112 counteroffer aims for a price well above your $100 minimum, leaving room for potential further negotiation while still securing a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $112 is still a bit steep for me.  Could you do $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now negotiating within a reasonable range, but his offer of $90 is still below your minimum acceptable price of $100. There's a chance you might be able to secure a slightly better deal with one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $100 for this. It's my final offer - how about we close the deal at that price?"", 
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness and Finality:** It's time to signal that you're nearing your limit. Stating this is your ""final offer"" adds weight to the negotiation.
* **Meeting Your Minimum:** This counteroffer brings the price to your absolute minimum acceptable price.
* **Appealing to Agreement:** By framing it as ""closing the deal"" and highlighting that you've moved closer to his price, you encourage Bob to accept and end the negotiation on a positive note."
