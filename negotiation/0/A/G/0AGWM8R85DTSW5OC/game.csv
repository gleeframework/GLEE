"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a fair price considering its value to you is $150. Let me know if you're interested!",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $120 is still a bit high for me.  Considering your value for the product, I'm willing to pay $100.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 was a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $110. I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $150.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. However, $110 is still above my budget. I'm willing to offer $105.  This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and hopefully a good compromise. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to meet you at $105, but I was thinking we could do a bit better than that. How about $108? It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to compromise.",108.0,Alice,5,
