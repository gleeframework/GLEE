Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to part with it for $10,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $10,000 is higher than your minimum of $8,000, so you're already making a profit.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value of $12,000, so there's room for him to counteroffer without feeling like he's being ripped off.
* **It sets the tone:** By offering a specific price, you show you're serious about selling and you're open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  I think that's a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your desire to get closer to your asking price, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $9,250. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $9,250 is very close to my desired profit margin.  It's time to close the deal and secure the sale."
