{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's valuation, but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a deal closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum of $150. I'm going to counteroffer to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm offering $140, which is still above my minimum price but is a compromise from my previous offer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate, while still ensuring I get a reasonable price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still below it. I'm going to counteroffer one more time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget.  I'm willing to come down to $135 as a final offer. This is the lowest I can go while still making sure I get a fair price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm offering $135, which is only $5 below my minimum but still gives Bob a chance to get the product.  I'm hoping this will be enough to reach a deal without having to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $135, but I'm still a bit over budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum price. While I want to make a deal,  it's not worth risking getting less than my minimum.  I'm going to sell the product to John for $150 to guarantee I get my desired price."
