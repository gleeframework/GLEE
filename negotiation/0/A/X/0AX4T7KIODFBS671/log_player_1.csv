This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also gives a positive message to Bob, increasing the chances of him accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price.  I want to try and get closer to my goal of $9,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $7,750. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750

Although Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $8,250?  This price represents a fair compromise, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 8250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think that I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,900. 
You have three options:

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go any lower.  John is offering me my minimum, so I'll sell to him to avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum price."
