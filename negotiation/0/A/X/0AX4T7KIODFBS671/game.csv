"I'm interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Can you meet me at this price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $7,500.  The product is worth more than that, and I'm confident it will bring you significant value.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This price still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product is worth more, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $7,750. Can you consider this price?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we settle on $8,250?  This price represents a fair compromise, and it's closer to my desired price.  Let's make this deal happen!",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that I can get a better deal elsewhere, but I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'm willing to pay $7,900 for the product. This is as low as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this price?",7900.0,Bob,6,
