"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Let me know if you're willing to consider my offer.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though.  I'm prepared to sell for $16,000. This would still leave you with a significant gain.  What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $14,000 was a bit too low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $15,200. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",15200.0,Bob,4,
