"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,300,000 is better than $1,500,000, there's still room for negotiation.  It's likely Alice is willing to go lower since she values the product at $1,200,000.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's offer but still represents a profit for her. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still leaving room for potential further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has raised her offer, but it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  I'll reject the offer and counter again, aiming for a price closer to my target.  There's still a good chance she'll accept a lower price to avoid losing the deal altogether."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but it's still below Alice's current price.  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while staying within my budget.  I'm hoping this offer will be enough to convince Alice to accept, but I'm also prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice keeps increasing her price, making it unlikely she'll come down to a price I'm comfortable with.  I'm getting closer to my maximum budget with each round, and I don't want to risk going over.  It's better to buy from John at $1,500,000 than to continue negotiating and potentially risk ending up with an even higher price."
