"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This offer reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $800,000 is still a significant gap from what I have in mind. I'm willing to consider $900,000 as my final offer. This takes into account your interest while reflecting the product's inherent value.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated $900,000 is her final offer.  While it's getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still above your maximum budget and John is offering the product for $800,000. There's no guarantee of getting a better deal from Alice at this point, so it's best to take the guaranteed savings with John."
