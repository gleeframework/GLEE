{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, leaving some room for negotiation. I'm also highlighting the product's value and showing some interest in Bob as a buyer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Accepting his offer allows me to complete the sale and avoid further negotiation."
