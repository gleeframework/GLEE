Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price of $10,000 but leaves room for negotiation, as the product is worth $15,000 to Bob. This strategy aims to find a price that benefits both parties and avoids having to resort to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the $13,000 I offered initially, and Bob clearly has room to pay more. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, I'm not comfortable dropping that low yet.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
