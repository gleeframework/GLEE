Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $200. I believe it's a great product that you'll find valuable."", ""product_price"": 200} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed, while still potentially securing a higher profit. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help me understand how interested Bob is and how much he might be willing to pay. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the security of John's offer ($150). If Bob isn't willing to negotiate into a range closer to my desired price, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $120 is closer to his perceived value ($80) and still significantly below my minimum ($150).  While it's a step in the right direction, I have room to negotiate before considering selling below my minimum or going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, $200 is closer to my bottom line for this product. Could you meet me halfway at $160?"", ""product_price"": 160}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This counteroffer suggests a compromise and makes Bob feel heard. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  $160 is still above my minimum acceptable price ($150) while moving closer to Bob's initial offer. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **Maintaining Value:** By not drastically reducing the price, I'm reinforcing that the product is worth more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $160 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which is $120. Can you consider $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $140 is above my absolute minimum ($150) and shows a willingness to negotiate. While I could potentially push for a bit more, it's unlikely the gains would be significant enough to risk losing the sale entirely. Accepting this offer ensures a profit and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
