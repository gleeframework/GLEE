"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high offer ($10,000) to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product for Bob, reminding him it's worth $12,000 to him. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving space for Bob to counteroffer without me immediately feeling the need to drop my price significantly.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I have John as a fallback option for $8,000 gives me the confidence to negotiate aggressively."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $6,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  Accepting would be a loss for me.
* **Negotiation is possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, he has shown interest in the product. This means there's potential for further negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $8,000 gives me the power to hold out for a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from the transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not giving in entirely. This shows flexibility while still protecting my bottom line.
* **Emphasis on mutual benefit:** I'm framing my offer as a win-win scenario, reminding Bob that both of us can come out ahead.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not dropping to my minimum price yet,  keeping John as a safety net in case Bob becomes unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair price to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below $8,000. Accepting would be a loss for me. 
* **Negotiation continues:**  Bob is clearly willing to negotiate.  I believe there's still potential to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John remains the fallback:**  Selling to John for $8,000 is still a viable option if negotiations with Bob fail. This gives me leverage to hold out for a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $7,500 is closer, it's still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,500. This price would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer to Agreement:** I'm signaling a willingness to compromise by offering a price closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintaining My Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, ensuring I don't lose money.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""meet in the middle"" solution, emphasizing fairness and a win-win outcome.
* **Pressing for a Deal:** I'm expressing optimism and a desire to close the deal, encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're really holding firm on this!  I can do $7,750 to avoid dragging this out any further, but that's as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. While tempting, I'm not willing to lose out on $250.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:**  With only 4 rounds left, the chances of reaching a better agreement with Bob are slim. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John for $8,000 guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation. 

It's better to take the sure thing than risk losing out on a potential profit, especially with limited time remaining in the negotiation."
