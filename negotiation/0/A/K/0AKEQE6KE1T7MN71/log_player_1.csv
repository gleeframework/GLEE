"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum value of $1,200,000, but it allows room for negotiation while still leaving me with a profitable sale. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below where I'd like to be. I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $950,000. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. I believe it's still a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $850,000 is tempting, it's still quite far from my minimum value. It's risky, but I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob. I might be able to get closer to my goal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with a price of $900,000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price given the product's value. I want to see if I can finally reach an agreement with Bob, but I'm also aware that time is running out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, the negotiations with Bob have stalled.  While I could continue negotiating with Bob, the risk of not reaching a deal within the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value of $1,200,000, ensuring a profitable outcome."
