"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it holds significant value for your operations, potentially worth far more than the asking price. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,100,000.  What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price, however, I believe my initial offer is closer to the true value this product brings. I'm willing to move down slightly to $1,050,000. This feels like a fair compromise. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm afraid $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $950,000. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I want to see this deal through, but $950,000 is cutting it a little too close.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,000,000? This feels like a fair compromise to me.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go a bit lower and meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Bob,6,
