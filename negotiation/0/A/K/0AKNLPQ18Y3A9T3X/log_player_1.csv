{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above my minimum of $8,000, but leaves room for negotiation, as Bob values the product at $12,000.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him closer to my desired $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. I understand it's a bit pricey, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my original offer. Let's split the difference. How about $9,250? It's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,500 again. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above that. Can you consider it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my ideal price, but it's getting close to my minimum.  It's not worth risking further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
