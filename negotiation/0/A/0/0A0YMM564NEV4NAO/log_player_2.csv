"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $100, which is still above Bob's maximum value ($120). 
* **Strategy:** It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  There are 9 rounds left, so Bob has time to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $100 is a bit out of my budget.  Would you consider $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money.
* **First counteroffer:**  A reasonable starting point. It's a significant reduction from Alice's offer but still gives her some room to negotiate.
* **Strategy:**  By offering $90, Bob is testing the waters to see if Alice is willing to come down in price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

```

* **Alice's offer:** $95, which is still above Bob's ideal price.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving and allows Bob to potentially get a lower price. There are still 7 rounds left, so he has time to work towards a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $95 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $92? "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save money.
* **Counteroffer:**  $92 is a small decrease from Alice's latest offer, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about getting a deal but isn't willing to overpay. The goal is to keep the negotiation moving towards a price closer to Bob's target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $98. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $98, which is still above Bob's ideal price and closer to the price from John.
* **Strategy:**  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation moving. There are 5 rounds left, which is enough time for Bob to potentially get an even lower price.  It's also worth noting that Alice is hinting she's reaching her minimum. This could mean there's less room for further negotiation, but it's still worth trying."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm really trying to make this work.  $98 is still a bit above what I can afford right now.  If you're serious about selling, I'm willing to go up to $94. Let me know what you think. "", ""product_price"": 94}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save money while still being close to closing a deal.
* **Counteroffer:**  $94 is a small increase from Bob's previous offer, showing a willingness to compromise.  This suggests to Alice that he is serious about buying, but still trying to get the best price.
* **Strategy:** The goal is to reach a price that's mutually acceptable. By offering $94, Bob is testing the waters to see if he can close the deal without having to go to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make it work, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $96. It's my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $96
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $96, which is closer to Bob's target price, and Alice has stated it's her final offer.
* **Strategy:** Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product and saves a significant amount compared to buying from John.  There are only three rounds left, and risking further negotiation could lead to a stalemate or Bob having to pay John's higher price.  This is a good compromise that allows Bob to achieve his goal of saving money."
