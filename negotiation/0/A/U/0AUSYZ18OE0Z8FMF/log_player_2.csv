"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $15,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting her offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high.  By offering $13,000, I'm aiming for a price closer to Alice's minimum while leaving myself some room for potential negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is only $500 more than my previous counteroffer. This is a good deal for me, as I'm still saving $1,500 compared to buying from John. It's unlikely I can negotiate further and get a significantly lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option."
