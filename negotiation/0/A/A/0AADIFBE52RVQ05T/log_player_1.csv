Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to consider the offer quickly. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer helps gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you haven't lost anything and can always fall back on John's offer."
