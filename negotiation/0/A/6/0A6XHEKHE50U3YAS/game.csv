"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $160. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $160 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $145. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from the product.",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $145 is still outside of my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $135? I'm sure we can come to a deal that works for both of us.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $145 was still a bit high for you, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $140. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $140 is still a bit high.  I'm committed to getting this product, but I'm only able to go up to $135.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can close this deal.",135.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $135. I'm willing to make one more concession and sell the product to you for $138. This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product.",138.0,Alice,7,
