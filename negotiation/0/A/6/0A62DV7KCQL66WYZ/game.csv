"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. To kick things off, I propose a starting price of $1,100,000. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your position, however, the value of this product is quite high, and $900,000 is a significant step down.  Could you consider $1,050,000? This reflects the true value while recognizing your interest.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  While I agree the product is valuable, $1,050,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
