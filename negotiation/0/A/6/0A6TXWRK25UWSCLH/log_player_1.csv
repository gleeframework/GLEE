Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a bold move, but I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can always lower the price in subsequent negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not in a rush. I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can send a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,750,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above Bob's minimum. I'm hoping that he sees the value in the product and is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price than John's offer, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get me much closer to my initial target.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
