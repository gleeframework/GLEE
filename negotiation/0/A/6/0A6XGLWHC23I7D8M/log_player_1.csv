"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 950000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a price that's still attractive to Bob while leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if he's willing to pay close to my ideal value before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I want to see if I can push him higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still ensuring a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  While I'd prefer a higher price, accepting this offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or even a rejection. I'm not sure I can get a better offer from Bob and I want to avoid risking the deal completely."
