Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $90. I believe you'll find it a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's maximum valuation ($100) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate a slightly lower price, which he might perceive as a win, while you still secure a price significantly higher than your minimum.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $99 might make Bob feel like you're trying to squeeze every dollar out of him, potentially pushing him away.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit with ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
