Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it would be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm asking for $18,000."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you can aim high initially.  This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** While brief, the message hints at the product's value without revealing your bottom line. This encourages Bob to engage further.
* **Testing the waters:** This first offer helps gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will guide your next move. 

**Important Note:**  There's an element of risk here. If Bob is turned off by the high price and walks away, you're left with the $10,000 from John. However, the potential reward of securing a much higher price makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
