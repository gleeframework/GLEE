{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting the initial offer at my minimum price of $1,500,000 to allow for negotiation and potentially securing a higher price.
* **Plan B:**  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if Bob proves unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking of making a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I'd like to get closer to my target price. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob is willing to negotiate, so there's potential to get closer to my desired price.
* **Sell to John is always an option:** If the negotiation doesn't yield a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John for my minimum price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,200,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering with $1,300,000, which is a compromise but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him and emphasizing that this price is still attractive.
* **Splitting the Difference:**  I'm suggesting a ""split the difference"" approach to make the offer seem more reasonable.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for further negotiation, but I'm firm about not going below my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,200,000 and $1,300,000, which would be $1,250,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation ongoing:** There's still room for negotiation. Bob is showing a willingness to increase his offer, so there's potential to reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **Sell to John is always an option:**  If the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory result, I can always sell to John.

I will reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm getting close to my maximum budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,250,000 and $1,350,000, which would be $1,300,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for a deal:**  While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal considering I can always sell to John for $1,500,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, and I might have to settle with John's offer anyway. 

Accepting Bob's offer is a strategic move that balances maximizing profit with minimizing the risk of losing the deal entirely."
