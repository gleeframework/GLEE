"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $700,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think you'll find it's a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello again Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $800,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to $800,000, but I'm still a bit above my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I can do $850,000, which is the lowest I can go. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I think we can finalize the deal.",850000.0,Alice,5,
