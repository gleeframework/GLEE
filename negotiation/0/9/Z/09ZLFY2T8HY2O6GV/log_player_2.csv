"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great product for $9,500. I believe it will be very valuable for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is higher than the product's worth to her ($9,500 vs $8,000).** This means there's room for negotiation.
* **You have a better alternative:** You can buy from John for $10,000. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a lower price.**

By rejecting the offer, you can make a counteroffer and try to secure a better deal. You might even get Alice to lower her price closer to her own valuation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but the product is quite valuable.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now $9,000.** This is still higher than the product's worth to her ($8,000), but it's significantly closer to your initial counteroffer of $8,500.
* **The offer is below your maximum budget ($10,000).**  Accepting means you save money compared to buying from John.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better price.** Alice is clearly willing to negotiate but is also firm in her position.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most reasonable choice, as it allows you to secure the product for a price that is within your budget and represents a good deal."
