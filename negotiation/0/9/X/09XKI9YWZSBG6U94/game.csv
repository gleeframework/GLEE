"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I do like it, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
