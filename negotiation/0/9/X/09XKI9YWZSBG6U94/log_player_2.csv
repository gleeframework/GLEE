"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way too high. It's important to negotiate a better price, especially since we have the option to buy from John for $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I do like it, $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000.  Let me know what you think."",
 ""product_price"": 6000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can sell the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, $9,000 is still higher than our alternative option with John. We should continue negotiating to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $7,500? That feels like a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I can sell the product to you for $8,200. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value the product holds for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""
}
``` 

Alice's offer is getting close to our limit, but we have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate with Alice, especially since she stated this is her final offer.  We should take the sure deal with John."
