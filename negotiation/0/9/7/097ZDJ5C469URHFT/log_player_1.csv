"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  I'll gauge Bob's interest with this initial offer and adjust accordingly in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $1,000,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,750,000. This is still a good profit for me, and I'm hoping Bob will see the value in this product and be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the offer.  I'm going to try to get closer to my target price with another counteroffer. There's a risk Bob might walk away, but I'm not ready to sell for that low yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to $1,600,000.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping to secure a deal with Bob before he gets discouraged and walks away.  I'm feeling confident that this offer will be attractive enough for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer, although it's getting closer to my minimum.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get him to come up a bit further. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1450000}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm lowering the price just a bit more to $1,450,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept. If he rejects again, I'll sell to John."
