I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum value, but leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm reducing my price to $1,250,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a fair price, and we can finalize the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident we'll reach a mutually agreeable price.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and it's better to secure a certain outcome than risk ending up with a lower price."
