"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a strong opening offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll see the value in it, and I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the opening bid, I believe the product's value is closer to  $600,000. I'm open to negotiating further to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I still believe the product's value is higher than $600,000. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a new price of $700,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the product's true value to you. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While $700,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $600,000.  Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm proposing a new price of $675,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",675000.0,Alice,5,
