Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a good starting point as it's higher than my minimum acceptable price but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll observe Bob's reaction and adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. While I'd like to get the best price possible, selling to John for $15,000 is still a good outcome. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further, but I won't settle for such a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $12,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price and leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me. I've already made significant concessions, and while I'd prefer to close a deal with Bob, selling to John for $15,000 is a secure and profitable outcome."
