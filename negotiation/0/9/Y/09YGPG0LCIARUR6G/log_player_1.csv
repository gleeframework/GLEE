"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible opportunity to own this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, I want to start with a high offer to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for me to come down in price while still potentially securing a deal well above Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""potential"" of the product, aiming to plant the seed that it might be worth even more than $1,000,000 to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and invites Bob's input, making it clear that this is the opening move in a negotiation. 

I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on Bob's response to this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is a significant premium over his perceived value, it's still substantially less than what John is offering. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget considerations.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations in terms of value. To find a middle ground, I propose a price of $1,750,000."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I've significantly reduced my price from $2,000,000 to signal flexibility, but I'm still aiming high. This counteroffer represents a point roughly halfway between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's potential to exceed Bob's expectations, subtly nudging him away from fixating solely on his initial $1,000,000 valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While this is a firm counteroffer, I'm leaving space for further discussion and potential concessions in later rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $1,750,000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,375,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating willingness to negotiate. However, $1,375,000 is still significantly less than John's offer.  I believe I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation, at least for another round.  The risk of losing Bob at this point doesn't outweigh the potential for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. I believe this reflects the true value of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Strategically:** I'm lowering my price, but not to the midpoint between our last offers. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains a strong position.
* **Shifting Focus to Value:**  I'm subtly shifting the conversation away from splitting the difference and back to the inherent value of the product. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** While I haven't explicitly stated a deadline, offering a  $1,600,000 price now suggests this is a favorable deal that shouldn't be left on the table too long."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalled Negotiations:** Bob's offer increments are getting smaller. While he might still go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll reach John's offer of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a cost in terms of time and potential deals with other buyers.  
* **Guaranteed Return:** John's offer represents a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a solid return and eliminates the risk of Bob ultimately walking away. 

While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, it's not worth risking the sure thing with John."
