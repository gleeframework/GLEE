Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 1750000} 

This is a high starting price, reflecting the value I place on the product. I believe it leaves room for negotiation while still being potentially attractive to Bob, given his valuation. This strategy allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing us to find a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,250,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise, lowering my initial price by $150,000 while still remaining above Bob's offer.  This strategy aims to show flexibility while remaining close to my desired price point.  I believe this could lead to a final agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While it's tempting to continue negotiating with Bob, his latest offer of $1,150,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable value. Given that John is willing to pay my desired price of $1,500,000, it's more advantageous to sell the product to him.  This ensures I reach my financial goals without further risk or uncertainty."
