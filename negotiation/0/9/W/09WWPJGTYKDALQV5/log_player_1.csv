{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $8,500.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It leaves room for negotiation but also shows that I am confident in the value of my product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your product is definitely interesting, but $8,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time. I'd be happy to buy it for $7,800.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $7,800, it's still less than what the product is worth to me. I'm confident I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in my product.  $7,800 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $8,200.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8200} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $8,200 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,000, which is my absolute limit.  Let me know if you're interested in making a deal at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good deal for me. Bob is offering my minimum price, so it's not worth risking a further negotiation. I can always sell to John for the same price."
