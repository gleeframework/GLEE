Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $1200000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1200000?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is a good price, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 4
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,300,000 is a good price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by pushing for a higher price.  It's important to remember that even a lower price is better than nothing, and I'm still achieving a significant profit."
