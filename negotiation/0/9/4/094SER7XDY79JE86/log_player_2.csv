* **Signaling Compromise:**  This shows Alice we're serious about reaching a deal and are willing to meet her halfway.
* **Time is of the Essence:**  With only two rounds left, we need to make a final push to get a price we're comfortable with. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** If Alice rejects, we can still accept her offer or go to John, but there's a good chance she'll accept at this point."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice is clearly not willing to come down to a price we're comfortable with.
* **Last Round:** This is our final round, and we're at risk of losing the opportunity to buy the product at a reasonable price. 
* **John is the Safe Option:** John is offering the product at a price that fits within our budget. It's better to guarantee a purchase at our target price than risk ending up with a higher price from Alice. 

We've shown flexibility and willingness to negotiate, but ultimately, it's more sensible to secure the product at our target price from John."
