"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see the value in the product,  $1,100,000 is still a bit beyond my budget.  How about $925,000?  That's a significant step from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
