Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I know will be a great asset to your business. My asking price is $1,200,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential returns I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find common ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. Let's try to find a middle ground, what do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,100,000, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above that number. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is a significant improvement over his previous offers. It's also very likely he won't budge further, and I risk losing the sale entirely if I keep rejecting. Accepting his offer secures a good profit and ensures the deal goes through."
