Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is still above my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, but I can only go up to $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $950,000 for it. I'm willing to make a concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need for profit, but $950,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's meet in the middle to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $925,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still higher than you'd like to pay. You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and there's still room to lower the price. It's worth trying to get a better deal before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm determined to get this product, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'm willing to offer $910,000.  This is a fair compromise that gives us both something we want. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 910000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're serious about getting this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get at least $920,000 for it. Let's see if we can meet in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $20,000 higher than what you are comfortable with, and you only have 3 rounds left.  It's unlikely you'll be able to get her down to your target price. Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product within your budget and saves valuable negotiation time."
