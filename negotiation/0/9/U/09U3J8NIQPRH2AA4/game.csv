"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 just doesn't cover my costs. How about we meet in the middle at $140? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",140.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. That's the highest I'm willing to go.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $125 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $132.50. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
I'm still not comfortable with the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. It's the highest I'm willing to go.,130.0,Bob,6,
