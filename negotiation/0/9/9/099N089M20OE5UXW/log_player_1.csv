"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I know you'll recognize its immense value. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  By starting with a price significantly higher than both Bob's valuation and your minimum, you establish a strong initial position. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a potentially excellent deal. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""immense value,"" subtly suggesting the high price is warranted.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""to kick things off"" implies flexibility and willingness to negotiate.

This strategy aims to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility while keeping the door open for a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have room to negotiate, and selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  While your offer is reasonable, I believe this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I feel this is a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Downward Movement:**  You've made a significant concession from your initial price to demonstrate your willingness to negotiate and meet Bob somewhere in the middle.
* **Value Justification:** You reiterate the product's potential to justify the higher price, subtly reminding Bob of the potential benefits he might be overlooking.
* **Firm but Fair:** While the price is still above both Bob's valuation and your minimum, the tone aims to be firm about your valuation while remaining open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is a significant profit over your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating serious interest in the product. 
* **Time Value:** Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's also the risk of Bob lowering his offer or stalling negotiations. Accepting now secures a very good deal."
