"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob.  While your offer is reasonable, I believe this product offers significant untapped potential that justifies a higher price point.  I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I feel this is a fair compromise.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your perspective on the product's potential, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
