Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a unique product that I believe would be highly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a strong offer close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) to maximize potential profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer allows for some negotiation while still remaining significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price without revealing Bob's maximum valuation. 

This strategy aims to secure a deal that's highly advantageous for you while still being appealing enough for Bob to accept."
