"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.  Let me know what you think.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,500,000, which is the price John is willing to sell it to me for. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to make sure it's a good value for me.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm confident the product is worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?  This would still be a great value for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my desired price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $1,350,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1,350,000 as my new offer. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us, but I need to stay within my budget.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  Let's settle at $1,425,000.  This compromise ensures you get a good price, and it allows me to avoid selling below my minimum.  What do you say?",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,425,000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000, which is the same as my previous offer. I'm hoping we can meet at this price point. It's a great value for me, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
