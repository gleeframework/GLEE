Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120.  It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$120** is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **The message is friendly and encouraging.** It highlights the value proposition for Bob and invites him to start the conversation. 
* **I'm prepared to counteroffer** if Bob rejects my initial price, but I'll keep in mind John's offer of $80 as my absolute minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$100 is still a good price for me.**  It's above my minimum of $80 and represents a good profit. 
* **However, I believe I can do better.** Bob has shown he's interested and willing to negotiate. By rejecting his offer, I can push for a price closer to my initial $120.
* **I'm confident I can secure a higher price through further negotiation.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That gives you a great price and still allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **I'm proposing a compromise:**  This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not willing to give in completely to his initial counteroffer.
* **$110 is a fair price:** It's above my minimum and still gives Bob a significant discount from the original $120.
* **My message is positive and encouraging:** This keeps the negotiation amicable and increases the likelihood of a successful outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to go a bit lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **$105 is a very good price for me.** It's significantly above my minimum of $80 and represents a good profit. 
* **Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly higher price.** Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate but is firm on his offer.  
* **There is a risk that Bob might reject any further counteroffers, potentially leading to a sale to John at $80.** 

While I would love to get closer to my initial $120, accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether."
