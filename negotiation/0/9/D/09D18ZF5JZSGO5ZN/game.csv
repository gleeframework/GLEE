"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and you'll get a lot of value out of it. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you be willing to go down to $85?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is still a great price for a product worth $100 to you, and it's closer to what I need to get.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $87.50?",87.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $87.50 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $89.  This is a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",89.0,Alice,5,
