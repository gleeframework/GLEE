"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to you, but given its worth to me, I would like to propose a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we aim for $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is still significantly lower than what I need.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,450,000? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I've considered your proposal, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,450,000. I'd like to keep pushing towards a price closer to what I'm willing to pay. How about we try $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
