"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my own valuation and the current market, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the valuation, however, the price needs to be closer to my initial offer to reflect the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for you.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
