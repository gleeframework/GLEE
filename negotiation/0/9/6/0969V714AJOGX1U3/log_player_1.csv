Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the potential of this product, $1,600,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my own valuation and the current market, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price that benefits us both. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the valuation, however, the price needs to be closer to my initial offer to reflect the true value of this product.  Would you consider $1,450,000?"", ""product_price"": 1450000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,450,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it reflects the true value of the product while still allowing for a reasonable profit for you.

While Bob's offer matches John's, it seems unlikely Bob will go any higher. Accepting John's offer avoids further negotiation and guarantees the desired amount."
