"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above your target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $16000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $10000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concern, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer the product to you for $14000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $15000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me is $8000. What do you think?",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to go up to $9500. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $13000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $15000.
