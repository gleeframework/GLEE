Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a better price, but I'm getting closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value it offers. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,500, and it's better to secure the $8,000 deal with John than risk Alice sticking to her price."
