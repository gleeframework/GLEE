"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it really useful. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We can definitely negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're aiming to get the product as close to our $80 maximum as possible. Starting with a significantly lower offer gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:** The message is framed politely and suggests a willingness to continue the conversation.  We don't want to offend Alice and risk her walking away."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, $60 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but not quite:** Alice is getting closer to our price range, but we can still try to push for a better deal. We're only $5 away from our ideal price with John.
* **Time for a counter:** By rejecting, we can propose a counteroffer that might land somewhere between $80 and $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75?"",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're proposing a price directly in the middle of our last offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($85). This shows a willingness to compromise while still moving towards our goal. 
* **Reaching a Resolution:** We're getting into the later rounds of negotiation. A slightly more assertive approach, while still being respectful, can help close the deal quickly."
