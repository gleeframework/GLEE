Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** This gives him some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're still earning a profit and leaving some room for further negotiation.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  It avoids confusion and gets straight to the point.

Remember, this is just the first offer. Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $10,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,250 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate and is getting closer to my desired price, I'm going to accept his offer.  This is a good outcome for both of us and I can move on."
