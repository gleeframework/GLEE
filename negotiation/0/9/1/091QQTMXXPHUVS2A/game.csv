"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget.  However, $9,500 is simply too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $10,250?",10250.0,Bob,4,
