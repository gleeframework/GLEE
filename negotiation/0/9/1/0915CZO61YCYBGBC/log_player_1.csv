Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is significantly below the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?"", ""product_price"": 8750}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider $7,500? That's a fair compromise.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,125?"", ""product_price"": 8125}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting close to my limit.  I could possibly do $7,800, but that's really as high as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear he's very focused on staying as close to $7,000 as possible. At this point, the increments he's willing to offer are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's guaranteed $8,000 offer within the remaining rounds.  It's more profitable to take the sure thing with John."
