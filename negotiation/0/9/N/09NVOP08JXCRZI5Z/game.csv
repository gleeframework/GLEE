"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. How about $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $115.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it still gives you a good deal. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $115 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $105 is just a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110, which is a good compromise. Let's make a deal at this price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
