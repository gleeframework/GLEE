Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale.  Here's why:

* **It's higher than Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he's willing to pay up to that amount. You're offering it for $110, which is $30 more than his value.
* **It's lower than your fallback price:** You're guaranteed to get $120 from John, so you're willing to go slightly lower to get a sale from Bob.

By offering $110, you have a good chance of convincing Bob to buy, as it's still a decent deal for him, while also getting you a higher price than your fallback option."
