"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal outcome ($120) than my minimum acceptable price ($80).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This initial price leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, and it signals that I'm serious about making a deal.
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation and makes him feel valued."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, I believe there's still potential to get closer to my desired $100. 
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I'm willing to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better price. 

I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above Bob's offer, to show that I'm willing to compromise but also value the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $90 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more to make this work. How about $95? It's a good middle ground that allows both of us to get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but not by much.
* **Appealing to Fairness:**  I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""fair deal"" to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable compromise.
* **Motivation for Acceptance:** I'm leaving enough room for Bob to negotiate further while also showing that I'm not willing to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand where you're coming from, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $92? It's the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** Bob's offer is very close to my target price of $95.
* **Limited Rounds:** We are already in round 4, and I need to be realistic about the possibility of reaching a higher price in the remaining rounds.
* **Risk of Losing Out:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only John's offer of $80.

While I would love to get closer to my target price, accepting Bob's offer ensures a profitable deal and reduces the risk of losing a potential buyer."
