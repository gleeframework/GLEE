"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

**Reasoning:** We start with a low offer to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate. This offer is significantly lower than her initial offer, but still within our budget and allows room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. $60 is definitely too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $90 is closer to our target price, it's still above our ideal budget.  We have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $90 is still a little steep for me.  Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are moving closer to a potential agreement. By offering $75, we are splitting the difference between our last offer ($60) and her counteroffer ($90). This shows willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price below our $80 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85.  Let's see if we can close this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to our limit, but we're only $5 away from John's price. We should use our remaining rounds to see if we can nudge Alice down just a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about $78?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount."",
""product_price"": 78
}
```

**Reasoning:** We are now just below our upper limit of $80, but close enough to potentially entice Alice to accept. By stating we are ready to close the deal at $78, we signal this is our best offer and encourages her to accept."
