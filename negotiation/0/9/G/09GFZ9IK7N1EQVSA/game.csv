"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate you showing interest in the product. $60 is definitely too low for me, considering its value. How about we meet in the middle at $90? I'm willing to be flexible to make this work.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $90 is still a little steep for me.  Could you do $75? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here. $75 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85.  Let's see if we can close this deal. ",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate you working with me. How about $78?  That's a fair price, and I'm ready to close the deal at that amount.",78.0,Bob,6,
