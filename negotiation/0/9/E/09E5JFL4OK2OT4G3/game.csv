"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  Would you consider $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go below $15,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll offer it to you for $14,500. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm surprised you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $500. I'll make one more offer: I'll sell the product to you for $14,250. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",14250.0,Alice,7,
