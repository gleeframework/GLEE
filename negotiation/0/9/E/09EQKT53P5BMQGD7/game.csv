"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only do $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but $60 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  Could you do $90? I'm trying to be fair.",90.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, Alice. How about we split the difference from our last offers and settle at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,

"You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I can't quite do $75, but how about $85? That's my final offer.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to go up a bit, but $85 is still too high for me.  Would you consider $78?",78.0,Bob,6,
