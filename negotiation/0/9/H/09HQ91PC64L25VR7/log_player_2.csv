You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Since both Alice and John are selling the product for the same price ($1,200,000), and your goal is to save money, you should buy from John. There's no benefit to buying from Alice."
