Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,400,000. I know this product holds significant value for you, and I believe this price reflects its worth. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible.  While I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, Bob's higher perceived value allows me to aim higher.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 leaves a substantial profit margin for me while still offering Bob a significant discount compared to his perceived value of $1,500,000. 
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the first chance to buy, I create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially motivating him to accept before I explore other options."
