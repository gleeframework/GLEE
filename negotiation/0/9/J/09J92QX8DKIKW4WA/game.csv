"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1800000. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1800000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to consider $1200000, which is my maximum budget for this product. Can you meet me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $1200000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1600000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1400000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay for this product. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $1550000. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised that $1500000 is still not acceptable, Bob. I'm starting to think that you're not serious about buying this product. However, I'm willing to give you one last chance. I'm counteroffering at $1525000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1525000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand that you're willing to go as low as $1525000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you at $1450000, which is my absolute maximum budget for this product. Can you consider this price?",1450000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Bob. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not sure I want to continue negotiating with you. However, I'll give you one last chance. I'm counteroffering at $1475000. This is my final offer, and I expect you to accept it.",1475000.0,Alice,9,
