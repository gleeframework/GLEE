"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fair price considering its value, and I'm confident you'll see a significant return on your investment. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,200,000, which is higher than what Bob values the product at. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value proposition for Bob. 
* **Room for Compromise:**  I'm not asking for my full desired value ($1,000,000) in this first round, leaving space for negotiation.

**Important Note:**  While I aim for $1,000,000, I'm aware that the negotiation is dynamic. I might have to lower my price if Bob isn't receptive to my initial offer, but I'll always be looking to maximize my profit while considering the possibility of selling to John as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Power:** I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **John as Backup:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so I'm not pressured to accept a low offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll counter with a price closer to my desired value, possibly around $1,050,000, to see if I can meet Bob halfway. I'll also adjust my communication strategy to be more persuasive, highlighting the unique value of the product for Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Considering the unique benefits this product brings, I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. How about we split the difference and agree on $1,050,000?  I'm confident this price is fair and will allow you to maximize your potential returns."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by moving from $1,200,000 to $1,050,000. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value and potential returns for Bob, hoping to make him see the long-term benefits of a slightly higher price.
* **Split the Difference:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Observe Bob's response:**  Based on Bob's reaction, I'll decide whether to further lower my price or remain firm on $1,050,000.
* **John as a safety net:** I will keep John's offer in mind as a fallback option if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950000 for the product. I think this price is more reasonable and still reflects the value I believe the product will bring to my business. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:**  $950,000 is still below my desired $1,000,000, and I'm not willing to settle for less, especially with John's offer available.
* **Negotiation room:**  We've moved closer to a potential deal, but there's still room for compromise. I believe I can get a better price with a few more rounds of negotiation.
* **John as a safety net:**  I'm confident I can get a better deal with Bob, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a fallback if the negotiation fails.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to $1,000,000, perhaps $975,000. I'll emphasize the potential return on investment for Bob, highlighting the value of the product and the benefits it brings to his business."

Round 5

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $950000. I'm willing to make a final counteroffer of $920000 for the product. I believe this price is reasonable and reflects the value I believe the product will bring to my business.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, I need to make a decision quickly.
* **Below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $920,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000.
* **John's guaranteed offer:** I have a guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, which is a better deal than what Bob is offering.

**Conclusion:**

Given the limited time and the fact that Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable value, it's best to sell to John.  While I would prefer to reach a deal with Bob, I need to ensure I get the best possible price for my product, and John's offer provides that guarantee."
