Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate its value. I'm offering it to you for $130. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's also significantly lower than your minimum price.  This strategy aims to start the negotiation with a reasonable offer that might entice Bob while still giving you room to bargain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum price, it's still below what you'd like to earn.  Rejecting his offer allows you to counter and try to get a better price, while still having the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference - how about $115?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $110 is still below your initial target, it's very close to it, and further negotiation might risk losing Bob altogether.  Accepting his offer secures a decent profit and avoids the possibility of a lower counteroffer from Bob or having to sell to John at a lower price than your minimum."
