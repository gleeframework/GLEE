"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I appreciate you meeting me halfway from the initial offer,  $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle closer to the middle at $1,025,000? This reflects my willingness to negotiate while still recognizing the true value of this product.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and propose a price of $950,000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that balances the value of the product with my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence in this negotiation. However, I need to be upfront â€“ the value of this product to me is quite high, and going below $1,000,000 is a significant stretch.  That being said, I value finding a solution with you. My final offer is $990,000. This is the lowest I can go and still feel comfortable with the deal.",990000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more attempt to find a compromise. I propose a price of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price that takes into account the value of the product and my budget.",920000.0,Bob,6,
