"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a great deal, and I'm sure you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you thinking of me, but $120 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I'm sure we can find a way to make this work.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $110 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $120 and $110, so I'm proposing a price of $115. I think this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget. How about we settle at $112? This is a good compromise, and I'm confident we can make this deal work.",112.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $112 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to reduce the price by $2, so I'm proposing a price of $110. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,5,
