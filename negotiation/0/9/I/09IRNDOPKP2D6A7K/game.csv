"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with an offer of $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product,  $1,200,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000, which is the maximum I can afford. I'm sure you'll agree this is still a very fair price, considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,200,000.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution. I'll offer $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects a good compromise for both of us, and it's the closest I can get to my budget.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is your best offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,080,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,200,000.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While I recognize the value of the product, $1,080,000 is still pushing my budget.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,050,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's in both our best interests to close this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're sticking to your offer of $1,050,000, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll sell the product to you for $1,070,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you and my initial offer of $1,200,000. I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1070000.0,Alice,7,
