"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

While $12,000 is a reasonable price, there's a chance Alice might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this offer, you can gauge if she's open to a better deal. If not, you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
