{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $15,000. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to be aggressive but still within a reasonable range. I'm hoping to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. I'm not willing to give up on trying to negotiate further. There's still a chance to get a better price, and I don't want to settle for a higher price than I need to."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
