"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to ensure I receive a fair price for the value of this product.  Let's compromise at $1,050,000. This would still provide you with a significant savings compared to the value you place on it, while allowing me to get closer to my target.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. Would you be willing to meet me at $950,000? I'm trying to find a sweet spot where we can both be happy with the deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a middle ground, and $950,000 is getting closer. However, I need to ensure a more substantial return on my investment. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which still allows you a significant savings.  Let's make this final offer. I'm confident we can both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
