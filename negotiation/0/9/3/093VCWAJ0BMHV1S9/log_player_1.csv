{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $150, which is a great price.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $150, which is significantly higher than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down. 
* **Positive Framing:** I'm using positive language to make the offer appealing.
* **Asking for Feedback:**  Ending with a question invites Bob to respond and engage in the negotiation. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing I can always sell to John for $120 gives me confidence to hold out for a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Could we possibly negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Minimum:**  Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price.  While I could accept and be done with the negotiation, I want to see if I can get a better price.
* **Potential for Higher:**  There's a good chance Bob might be willing to go higher than $120. Since he's already shown interest, he might be willing to compromise a little.
* **The Power of Counteroffers:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get closer to my desired price. 

**Next Step:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for something slightly higher than his offer but still below my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $135.  It's still a great deal for a product of this quality, and I believe it's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price from $150 to $135, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value by mentioning its quality. This subtly reinforces that $135 is still a good deal.
* **Fairness:** I frame the counteroffer as a win-win situation, emphasizing fairness for both parties.
* **Strategic Middle Ground:** $135 is a middle ground between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, making it a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Would it be possible to reach a price closer to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $125 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Limited Upside:** While I could potentially try to negotiate further, the chance of getting a significantly higher price is low. Bob has shown he's willing to pay up to $125, and further negotiation might risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing to negotiate takes time and effort, and I could be losing potential opportunities with other buyers. Accepting his offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on. 

**Overall:**  Given the circumstances, accepting Bob's offer of $125 is the most logical decision. It ensures a sale and maximizes my potential earnings, considering my minimum price and the likelihood of a successful negotiation."
