Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a bit above what the product is worth to Bob, but I believe it's a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation.  I'm confident that if Bob rejects this offer, we can still reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $105 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my initial asking price.  I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price to $115, which is still a fair price for me while being closer to Bob's offer. I believe this price strikes a good balance and increases the chances of reaching an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's final offer of $100 is the same as what I could get from John.  There's no point in further negotiation, so I'll accept his offer."
