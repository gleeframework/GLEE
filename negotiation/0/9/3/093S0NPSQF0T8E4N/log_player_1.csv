I'm starting high, at $1,800,000. This is above Bob's perceived value, but I'm confident he'll counteroffer, allowing us to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial price. I'm not willing to go lower than $1,500,000, as that's the price John is offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a compromise."

I'm reducing my price to $1,600,000. This is a significant move from my initial offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.  It's still above Bob's offer, but hopefully, it's close enough to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not budging on his price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm now too close to John's offer to risk further negotiation.  It's time to secure the sale and avoid any more potential losses."
