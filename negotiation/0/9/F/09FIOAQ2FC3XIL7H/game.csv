Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and rarity.,900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $750000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $825000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $800000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800000 is a tempting offer, Bob, but I still need to prioritize getting a good price for the product. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer $815000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet in the middle.",815000.0,Alice,5,
