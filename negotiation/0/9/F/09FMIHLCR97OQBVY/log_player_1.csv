{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price slightly higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. 
* **Leaving Room for John:**  We know John will buy the product for $150, so any price Bob accepts above that is a win for us. 

This offer aims to find a balance between maximizing potential profit and avoiding scaring Bob away with an unreasonable initial price."
