"Hello Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really like. I'm offering it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. What do you think?",200.0,Alice,1,,

"I'm interested in the product, but $200 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $175 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",175.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,190.0
"I understand that $175 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway, but not quite all the way. I can offer it to you for $185. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",185.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $185 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $180 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",180.0,Bob,4,,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $180, but I need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $187.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",187.5,Alice,5,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to meet you at $182. However, I need to make a bit more profit. I can offer it to you for $185, but I'll throw in a special bonus that's not included in the original price. It's a deal you won't want to pass up!",185.0,Alice,7,,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer,
"I appreciate the bonus offer, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $182 for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price. Can you reconsider?",182.0,Bob,8,,
