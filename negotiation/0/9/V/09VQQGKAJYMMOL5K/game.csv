"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a price closer to $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to work within a budget. While your initial offer is a bit below what I had in mind, I'm willing to be flexible to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet halfway and settle on a price of $1,025,000? This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal happen.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate the effort to find common ground. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $975,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and I want to close this deal.  However, the product's value is significant and $975,000 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I can go down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
