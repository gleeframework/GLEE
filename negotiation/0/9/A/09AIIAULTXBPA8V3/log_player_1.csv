Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $11,000 is more than your minimum of $10,000, so you're already getting a good price.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  A higher price might scare Bob off, but $11,000 is still within the realm of reason.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can still come down slightly if Bob counters.

Remember, this is just a starting point. You can adjust your offer based on Bob's reaction and how you feel about the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is a decent offer, it's below your minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's better to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a better price. John is a safe alternative, so you're not taking a huge risk by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my original offer. How about $10,500?  This price would be fair for both of us and allow us to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:**  This counteroffer is a compromise. It's lower than your initial offer but still above Bob's offer and your minimum.
* **Reasoning:**  You are demonstrating flexibility while still holding firm on your bottom line. 
* **Next Steps:**  Now you wait to see if Bob accepts your counteroffer or if he counters again. You are in a good position to negotiate a favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer. I understand that $10500 is still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10250. I think this is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to finalize the sale. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,250 is above your minimum of $10,000 and very close to your last counteroffer. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and allows you to move on.  While you could try for a slightly higher price, the risk of further negotiation might lead to Bob walking away entirely, or you might have to settle with John's offer of $10,000. Accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice to maximize your earnings in this situation."
