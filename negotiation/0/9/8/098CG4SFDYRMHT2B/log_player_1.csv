"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what I'd get elsewhere.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Highlighting the Benefit:** I emphasize that this price is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than what I could get from other buyers. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  My message is open ended, encouraging Bob to counter offer and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think we can find a price closer to my budget. How about $950,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  Bob is showing interest, and I can likely get a price closer to my ideal value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain leverage and signal that I'm not desperate for a quick sale.  This can encourage him to increase his offer. 
* **Strategic Risk Assessment:**  Selling to John is a safe option, but it's not maximizing my potential profit.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can close the deal with Bob at a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to finding a mutually beneficial price, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $975,000? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum and still a good deal for you."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I'm using Bob's counter-offer as a starting point but increasing the price slightly. This shows flexibility while still maintaining leverage.
* **Fair and Balanced:** I'm presenting a price that's a compromise, making it seem more reasonable and less aggressive. 
* **Focusing on Mutual Benefit:**  I reiterate the goal of finding a price that benefits both of us. This softens the stance and encourages a collaborative approach."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works better for both of us. How about $960,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:** While Bob has moved closer to my ideal price, there's still a gap between his offer and my desired amount.  I'm not ready to settle yet.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain control and signal that I'm not desperate to close the deal. This can incentivize him to offer a higher price.
* **Risk Management:** Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and close the deal closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and effort in finding a solution. While $960,000 is closer, I'm still a bit far from my target price. To bridge the gap, how about $970,000?  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** I'm proposing a small increase from Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise while also demonstrating that I'm not simply accepting his terms.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob that the product is worth more than his offer, but also acknowledging his budget constraints.
* **Collaborative Approach:**  I'm using language like ""find a solution"" and ""fair deal for both of us"" to maintain a collaborative and positive tone, encouraging Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering your offers and I believe we can reach a fair compromise. How about $965,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $965,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $965,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close, but Not Close Enough:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than what I could get from John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm not desperate to close the deal and that I'm willing to walk away if necessary. This can encourage him to increase his offer further.
* **Time is on My Side:**  We have a few rounds left, and I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for a price that's far from my minimum.
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I have a strong fallback option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept anything less than what I believe the product is worth."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer,  $965,000 is still a bit below what I'm hoping for.  How about $970,000? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and it's a good deal for you.  Let's reach a final agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase, Big Impact:** By increasing the price by just $5,000, I'm sending a clear message that I'm serious about getting closer to my minimum. This small increase can sometimes be enough to shift the negotiation in my favor.
* **Emphasizing Value and Deal:** I'm reiterating the product's value and reminding Bob that my offer is still a good deal for him. This helps maintain a positive tone while subtly pushing for a higher price.
* **Focusing on the Endgame:** I'm framing the message as a step toward a final agreement, suggesting that we're nearing the end of the negotiation and encouraging Bob to make a final push."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've reviewed our negotiations so far and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price. Would $967,500 work for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $967,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $967,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still a Gap:** Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not close enough to my desired price, especially considering I could sell to John for significantly more. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting his offer, I demonstrate my commitment to getting a price that's more in line with my valuation. This keeps the pressure on Bob.
* **Limited Time:**  With only two rounds remaining, it's a risk, but I'm betting that Bob will need to make a more substantial offer to close the deal. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe that Bob values the product and is willing to pay a bit more. I'm not ready to settle just yet."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $967,500 is closer, I'm still a bit short of my target. How about we meet in the middle at $970,000? It's a fair price that recognizes the value of the product and allows us to both walk away feeling satisfied.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 970000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** With only one round left, I'm making a final push for my desired price point. I'm betting on Bob's desire to close the deal and his acknowledgement of the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm proposing a compromise that is slightly higher than Bob's last offer, but also a reasonable midpoint that shows good faith.
* **Positive and Closing Language:** I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" and ""walk away feeling satisfied"" to create a sense of urgency and a positive outlook for both parties. 
* **Focus on Agreement:** I'm emphasizing the shared goal of finding a solution that works for both of us, reinforcing the idea of a mutually beneficial outcome."

Round 10
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $968,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $968,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Round:** This is the last round of negotiation, and while Bob's offer is closer to my ideal price, it's still significantly less than what I could get from John. 
* **Minimizing Loss:** While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I'm not willing to risk walking away from a guaranteed $1,200,000.
* **Safe and Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me a significant profit and avoids the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Bob.  
* **Time Sensitivity:** With limited time and no guarantee that Bob will accept my counter-offer, selling to John is the most prudent option."
