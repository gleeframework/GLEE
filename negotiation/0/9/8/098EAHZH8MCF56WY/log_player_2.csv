Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $90?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is quite low considering the product's value. Could you meet me halfway at $105?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but I can't go as low as $95. How about we split the difference again and settle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

``` 

This is a good time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Alice is at her bottom line:** Her language (""final offer"") suggests she won't go lower. 
* **You're getting a good deal:** $100 is the best price you could realistically hope for, given Alice's starting point.
* **John's offer is worse:** Buying from John would cost you $20 more. 

While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are small and you risk Alice walking away."
