"I'm interested in the product, but $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would give us both a good deal.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
