{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,700,000 is far above his budget, and he has plenty of room to negotiate a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $1,700,000 is way out of my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $850,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly unique and worth more than that. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is a significant reduction from my original offer. Let's keep the negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a lower price than the first offer, it's still too high. Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a price closer to his maximum budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,200,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $950,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to $1,100,000. This would be a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While Alice is getting closer to his budget, $1,100,000 is still too high. Bob has a few more rounds to try and negotiate a lower price before he needs to consider John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This would allow me to purchase the product and still stay within my budget. Let's reach a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see you're getting closer to my desired price. However, $1,000,000 is still not quite there.  I'm willing to make one last compromise and offer you the product for $1,200,000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the unique value of this product.  Let's close this deal now and make it mutually beneficial. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy from John. While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's desired budget. At this point, with only a few rounds remaining, it's more likely that Bob will be unable to get Alice to come down any further. John's offer is guaranteed and within Bob's budget."
