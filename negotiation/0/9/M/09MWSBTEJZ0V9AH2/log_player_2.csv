You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $160? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $130 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise again. How about $145? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, it's better to accept. Alice is likely firm on her price, and further haggling might not yield a better outcome. Accepting the $145 offer saves $5 compared to buying from John."
