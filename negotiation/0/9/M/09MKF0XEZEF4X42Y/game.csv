"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This would still be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
