Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a very valuable product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth a considerable amount to me, at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but still lower than what I know it's worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate if needed. 
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:**  By starting at $1,150,000, I can potentially negotiate up to the $1,200,000 mark without losing too much. 
* **The ""John"" Factor:** Knowing I have a backup buyer at $1,000,000 provides me with a safety net and allows me to be more assertive in negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000). 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price point by counteroffering. 
* **Avoiding Settling:**  I'm not willing to settle for a price that doesn't reflect the product's true value to me. 

**Next Steps:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my original offer but higher than his current offer. This will keep the negotiations going while trying to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This would still be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm counteroffering with a price that's in the middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize that $1,100,000 is a ""fair price for both of us"". This helps to frame the negotiation in a collaborative manner and potentially increase Bob's willingness to meet me halfway.
* **Leaving Room for Further Negotiation:**  While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm leaving some room for further negotiation in case Bob comes back with another counteroffer."
