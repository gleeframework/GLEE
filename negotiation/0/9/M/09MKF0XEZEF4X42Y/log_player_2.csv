"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a very valuable product I believe you'd be interested in. It's worth a considerable amount to me, at least $1,000,000. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a lower price point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm prepared to come down to $1,100,000.  This would still be a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target:** $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's desired price range than John's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While Bob could try to counteroffer again, there's a risk Alice might refuse and Bob would be forced to buy from John at a higher price. 
* **Minimizing risk:** Accepting the offer guarantees Bob gets the product at a lower price than John, minimizing the risk of missing out on the deal entirely."
