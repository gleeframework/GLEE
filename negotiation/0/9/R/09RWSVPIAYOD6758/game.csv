"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $9000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $8000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $8500, which is a significant discount from my original offer. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $7500 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think it's worth it to me at that price. Can you meet me at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is still a bit too high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $8250. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and I think it's a good compromise.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $8250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $7750 for the product. I'm really interested in it, and I think it's worth it to me at that price. Can you meet me at $7750?",7750.0,Bob,6,
