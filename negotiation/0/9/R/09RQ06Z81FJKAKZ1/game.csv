"Hi Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I think it's great, $120 is a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $80. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I still think the product is worth more than $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $105.",105.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However,  $105 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you be willing to do it for $90?",90.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 was still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $98.",98.0,Alice,5,
