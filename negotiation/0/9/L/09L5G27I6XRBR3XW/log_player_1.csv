Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 2000000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Above Bob's Value:** While you know Bob values the product at $1,000,000,  starting significantly above that might make him more willing to counter with a price closer to your desired range.
* **John as Leverage:**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you a strong position. You're not desperate to make a deal with Bob, which allows you to be firmer in your pricing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider it closer to  $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have the leverage of John's offer, so there's room to negotiate. It's worth seeing if you can get Bob closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that price doesn't quite reflect the value of this product, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, But Above Minimum:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.  However, it remains comfortably above your $1,500,000 minimum (and John's offer) to allow for further bargaining. 
* **Highlighting Value:** By reiterating the product's value, you aim to keep Bob focused on its potential benefits and justify a higher price. 
* **Encouraging Response:** Directly asking for Bob's thoughts keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you be willing to consider $1,400,000?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is now above your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit and avoids the potential loss of selling to John."
