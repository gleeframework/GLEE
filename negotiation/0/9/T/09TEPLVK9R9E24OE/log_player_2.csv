"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm happy to answer any questions you may have. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $119 is close to your maximum budget, you can try to get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $120, which is still within your budget, but you might be able to get the product for a little less."
