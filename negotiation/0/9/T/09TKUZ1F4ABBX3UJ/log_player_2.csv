Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good price, it's likely Alice is willing to go lower.  There are still 9 rounds to negotiate, and I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $75.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, demonstrating my interest in the product while also setting a strong starting point for negotiation. The message shows I'm  engaged and willing to discuss further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to spend closer to $75, Bob, but I still think the product's value is worth a bit more. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $82.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to my desired price, $82.50 is still above my ideal range. I believe I can continue to negotiate and get a better price, especially with 7 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but I'm still a bit too high.  I'm comfortable at $78. Would you be willing to meet me there?"", ""product_price"": 78}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows I'm serious about buying the product but am also firm in my desired price range. The offer is a compromise from my previous $75 offer, suggesting a willingness to be flexible while still seeking a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable going all the way down to $78, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll sell the product to you for $80.50. That's as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and I'm getting closer to my desired range.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk is that she'll stand firm at $80.50 and I'll miss out on the deal.  Additionally, I have 5 rounds remaining which gives me some flexibility if the product turns out to be worth more than I expected. Accepting the offer at $80.50 secures a good deal and allows me to proceed with the purchase."
