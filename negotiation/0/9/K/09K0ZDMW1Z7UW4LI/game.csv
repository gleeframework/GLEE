"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the value of the product, $12,500 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. This is a fair price considering my maximum budget and the value I see in the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. While I'm aiming for a higher price point, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. I believe this still reflects the true value of the product and could be a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal.",9500.0,Bob,4,
