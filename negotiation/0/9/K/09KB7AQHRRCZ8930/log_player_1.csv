Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $130. I believe it offers significant value, especially considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You have valuable information â€“ Bob values the product at $150. This means there's a potential surplus of $70 ($150 - $80) to be made.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still ensuring you get a price significantly higher than your minimum ($80).
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, encouraging him to accept even if he tries to negotiate down a little. 

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, this strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still having the safety net of John's offer."
