"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit too high for my budget though.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?",85.0,Alice,3,

"I understand, $85 is closer, but still a little too steep for me.  Could you do $70?",70.0,Bob,4,

"Okay, Bob, I see you're serious about this. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?  That's a very fair offer.",77.5,Alice,5,
