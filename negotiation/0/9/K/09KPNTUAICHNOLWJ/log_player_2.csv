Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $60 is significantly less than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $85?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Okay, Bob, I see you're serious about this. How about we split the difference and settle at $77.50?  That's a very fair offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5

While Alice is coming down in price, it's unlikely she'll go below $77.50. At this point, John's offer of $80 is the better deal."
