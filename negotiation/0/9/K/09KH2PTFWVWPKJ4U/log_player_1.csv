{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum price but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and positive, framing it as a good deal for Bob. 

**Reasoning:**

* I want to see if Bob is seriously interested in buying the product at a price that's closer to my ideal. 
* I'm leaving room for negotiation, which will allow me to gauge his interest level.
* If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have a better understanding of his maximum price and can adjust my counteroffer accordingly.
* I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Rejection:**  I'm rejecting Bob's counteroffer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd ideally like to get.
* **Reasoning:** I want to see if I can push for a higher price. Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate, and I believe I can secure a better deal. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will make a counteroffer to Bob in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. 
* I will be prepared to potentially walk away and sell to John if the negotiation doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is a compromise, showing that I am willing to negotiate further but still aiming for a price closer to my ideal.
* **Message:** I'm remaining polite and reiterating the value of the product to justify the price.

**Reasoning:**

* By meeting him halfway, I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal but not willing to give away too much.
* This counteroffer provides a clearer picture of where I stand while leaving room for further negotiations.
* If Bob still refuses, I can consider selling to John or making a final counteroffer."
