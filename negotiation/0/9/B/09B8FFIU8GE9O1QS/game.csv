"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my current financial situation, I can only afford to pay up to $800,000 for it. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits.  To move forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer, as I already have another interested buyer at a similar price point.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the item. I hope this proposal is within your consideration.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, your latest offer demonstrates a clear understanding of this product's potential. I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,000,000. So, I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your last offer and would like to propose $1,150,000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns with your expectations.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
