Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to own this truly unique product. Its value speaks for itself, and I believe it aligns perfectly with your needs.  I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000. Given its potential, I believe this is a fair starting point for our discussion."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. However, based on my current financial situation, I can only afford to pay up to $800,000 for it. I hope this revised offer aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount.  It's worth seeing if he'll come up considerably."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $800,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you substantial benefits.  To move forward, I can come down to $1,300,000. This is my best offer, as I already have another interested buyer at a similar price point."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Stance:** I'm reiterating that his offer is too low and implying I have other options (John).
* **Justification:**  I'm not just stating a price, I'm linking it to the product's value and the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Concession:** While significant, the price drop shows I'm willing to negotiate to a reasonable degree. 
* **Urgency:** Mentioning the other buyer adds a time pressure element, encouraging Bob to act quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. While I respect the value of the product, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1,100,000 for the item. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Movement:** Bob increased his offer substantially, signaling he's serious and sees the value. 
* **Still Room:**  He's closer to my minimum, but I believe there's potential to negotiate a bit further.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** Selling to John guarantees $1,000,000. It's a tempting safety net, but I'll risk another round to try for a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your latest offer demonstrates a clear understanding of this product's potential. I appreciate you moving closer to my position.  To be completely transparent, I have another buyer ready at $1,000,000. So, I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,200,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm stating this is my final offer, adding weight to the negotiation.
* **Transparency (and a bit of a bluff):**  Mentioning John's offer at $1,000,000 sets a clear bottom line and creates urgency for Bob. Even though it's my minimum acceptable price, phrasing it as another buyer's offer adds pressure.
* **Justification:**  I'm framing the price as a compromise and a fair deal, not just a number.
* **Balance:** This offer meets Bob halfway between his last offer and my previous one, signaling a willingness to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your patience and willingness to negotiate. I've carefully considered your last offer and would like to propose $1,150,000 as a fair compromise. I hope this aligns with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob is clearly engaged in the negotiation and has met me very close to the middle ground between our last two offers. 
* **Strong Position:**  While I could push for a bit more, there's a risk he walks away if I keep refusing. Accepting shows good faith and avoids jeopardizing a good deal.
* **Profitable Outcome:** $1,150,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, making it a successful outcome for me."
