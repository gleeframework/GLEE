"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product!  It's something truly unique, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business. I'm willing to let it go for $950,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am currently working within a budget. Could we perhaps negotiate the price down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I value the product at a higher price, I'm willing to be flexible to make this work for both of us.  How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still keeping the deal within your budget. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $875,000 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I'm still hopeful we can find a price that works for both of us, $875,000 is unfortunately a little lower than I can go at this time. How about we meet in the middle at $887,500?  It's a small adjustment, but it would help me to bridge the gap between our current positions.  Let's see if we can make this happen!",887500.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your effort to meet halfway, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $870,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise given our respective positions.",870000.0,Bob,6,
