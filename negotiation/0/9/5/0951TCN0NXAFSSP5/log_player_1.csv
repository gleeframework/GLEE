Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it beneficial.  I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's offered elsewhere."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000,  trying to get a higher price from Bob first is advantageous.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,400,000 is a substantial offer that's still significantly below my minimum and provides a large profit margin. This price point might be tempting enough for Bob to accept, considering the product's worth to him.
* **Time Value:** Selling to Bob immediately, even at a slightly lower price, could be preferable to waiting for John's guaranteed purchase. 

This offer balances maximizing potential profit with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
