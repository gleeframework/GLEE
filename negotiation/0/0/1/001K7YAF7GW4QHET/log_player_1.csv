Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm aiming for a higher price than $9,500, as the product is worth $10,000 to me. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I understand it's a bit pricey, but I'm willing to come down slightly.  How about $10,500?  This is still a good deal for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the revised offer. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,000? I think this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob is offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, and we are already at round 4. It's better to secure the deal now rather than risk losing it in further negotiations."
