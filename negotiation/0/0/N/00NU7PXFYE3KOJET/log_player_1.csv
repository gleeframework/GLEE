{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,650,000. It's a fair price, considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1650000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is slightly above your minimum value, leaving room for potential negotiation. By framing it as a fair price, you're hoping to establish a positive tone and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm willing to pay no more than $1,400,000 for the product. I think it's a bit pricey, and I'd like to discuss further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is above the minimum value, it's significantly lower than what you'd like to get. It's worth exploring if there's any room for negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product for $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1,475,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I'll get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

While Bob's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still below your minimum.  Selling to John guarantees you your minimum price, and it avoids further negotiation with Bob."
