"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe the value is well worth the price. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but not so high that it immediately kills the deal. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and persuasive tone, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 
* **Focus on Value:** I'm focusing on the value proposition for Bob, emphasizing the opportunity he'd be getting. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and encouraging Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would result in a considerable loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, it indicates he's still interested in the product. This means there's potential for negotiation in future rounds.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer maintains my leverage in the negotiation. It shows him that I'm not desperate to sell at his price and that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a fair deal.
* **Opportunity to Improve the Offer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to reach a price closer to my desired value. 

While selling to John for $1,500,000 is tempting, it's crucial to consider the potential of a better outcome with Bob through continued negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  It's clear we both see the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Rationale:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Moderate Compromise:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility without significantly sacrificing my earnings.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to remind Bob of its worth and justify my price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the tone positive and encouraging, hoping to maintain Bob's interest and increase the likelihood of a deal.

This strategy aims to find a middle ground, keep the negotiation moving, and potentially close the deal in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not comfortable going up to $1,600,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,450,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  While Bob's offer is higher than the previous round, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean selling the product at a loss.
* **Limited Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but there's still a significant gap. Accepting at this point would limit my potential for a better deal.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting the offer keeps my leverage in the negotiation. It shows Bob that I'm serious about achieving a price that's fair for both of us.
* **Opportunity for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for improvement in the negotiations. By rejecting Bob's offer, I can make a counteroffer in the next round that's closer to my target.

Although John is offering $1,500,000, I'm not ready to sell yet. I'm determined to see if I can secure a higher price with Bob. I'm confident that with strategic negotiation, I can reach a mutually acceptable agreement."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway – let's settle on $1,550,000. This is a compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Think about it – we're so close to a deal now!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his current offer and my previous counteroffer. It shows I am willing to negotiate and reach a middle ground.
* **Emphasize Proximity to Deal:** I highlight that we are ""so close to a deal,"" to encourage Bob to make a final concession. This creates a sense of urgency and encourages a quicker resolution.
* **Positive Tone:** I maintain a positive and persuasive tone, hoping to maintain Bob's interest and increase the likelihood of a deal.

This strategy aims to push Bob towards my minimum acceptable price while demonstrating a commitment to reaching an agreement. The hope is that this counteroffer will encourage Bob to accept, securing a profit for me while still avoiding selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but I'm not going any higher. Can we stick with that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We've reached a stalemate. Bob is unwilling to budge from $1,450,000, while I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We only have 4 rounds left.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better offer from Bob.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  It's a guaranteed profit and a better outcome than accepting Bob's offer.
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'm hoping for a higher price, it's important to consider the risk.  Staying with Bob could lead to a failed deal and no sale.

Selling to John is the most logical choice at this point.  It secures a profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation with Bob."
