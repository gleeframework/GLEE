"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is the highest I'm willing to go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low.  It's clear we both see the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. What do you say?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,300,000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I'm not comfortable going up to $1,600,000. Can we meet somewhere in the middle at $1,450,000?",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,450,000 still isn't quite there for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway – let's settle on $1,550,000. This is a compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling satisfied.  Think about it – we're so close to a deal now!",1550000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1,450,000, but I'm not going any higher. Can we stick with that price?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
