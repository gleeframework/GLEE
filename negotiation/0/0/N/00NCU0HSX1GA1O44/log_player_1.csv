Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product at a price of $1,200,000. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its unique qualities. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, we can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly implies the product's value justifies the high price without explicitly stating why Bob should value it more. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Gauging interest:** This initial offer is primarily to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. His response will dictate our next move.

This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the interaction open for potential negotiation and a successful sale to Bob."
