"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but still leaving some room for negotiation. This price is close to Bob's value, but still allows for a potential counteroffer that would benefit both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly less than the value I'm hoping to get for the product.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but still aiming for a deal that's closer to my desired value. This shows good faith while keeping the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price than Bob's offer. Although it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable value, I believe I can secure a better deal with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000} 
```

This is a small concession to show good faith while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. We're getting closer, and I want to keep the negotiations moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'm not thrilled with the price, it's only $80,000 less than what John is offering. Given that we're approaching the final rounds, it's unlikely I'll get a better deal. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and a decent profit."
