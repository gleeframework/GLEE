"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject. This sets the tone for the negotiation and gives me some room to maneuver in later rounds.  I want to see how much Bob is willing to pay and if he's serious about buying."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my target."

I'm still holding out for a better price, even with only three rounds left. $1,490,000 is close to my minimum but I think I can push for just a little bit more. I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
