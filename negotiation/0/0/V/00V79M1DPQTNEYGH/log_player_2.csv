"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I think you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000.  There's a chance Alice might lower her price to secure the sale rather than lose it entirely."
