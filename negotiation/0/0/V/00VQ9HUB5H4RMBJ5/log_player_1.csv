"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring you."",
""product_price"": 1000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with an ambitious offer significantly above my minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's eagerness and price sensitivity.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""incredible potential"" and ""true worth,"" I aim to anchor Bob's perception of value at a higher point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message makes it clear that this is an ""initial proposal,"" implying my willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,000,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While tempting, accepting Bob's offer would mean a loss of $50,000 compared to my alternative with John. I believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm willing to counter-offer to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  To find a compromise, I'm willing to come down to $925,000. This price reflects the true value of the product and its potential to benefit your business."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession ($75,000) from my initial price to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. 
* **Above the Middle:** This counter-offer is still substantially above the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's, keeping me anchored closer to my desired outcome.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm reiterating the product's value, aiming to shift Bob's focus from just the price to the benefits he'll gain."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price point. However, $925,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which I believe is fair for both of us. Let's close this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 represents a profit of $50,000 over my guaranteed sale to John. While I could try to push for more in subsequent rounds, there's a risk that Bob might lower his offer or walk away entirely. Accepting now secures a substantial profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
