"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000 to begin our conversation. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your initial offer, however, the value of this product is significantly higher than that.  To move us forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair offer considering the potential benefits you'll gain.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but that's still a bit too far outside my budget. How about $950,000? I feel that's a very fair offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see your offer as a sign of serious interest, the product's value warrants a higher price.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,300,000?",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm glad we're finding some common ground. To be completely honest, I have a budget of $1,000,000 for this purchase. If you're able to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal right now. Otherwise, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
