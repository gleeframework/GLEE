"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $100? It's my final offer.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking to my offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $100, Bob, but I'm still not willing to give up on the extra $25. How about we meet in the middle at $112.50? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $112.50 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking to my original offer of $100. Let's close this deal.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $100, Bob, but I'm not willing to give up on the extra $50. How about we do a one-time exception and meet in the middle at $110? It's a compromise that still benefits both of us.",110.0,Alice,7,
