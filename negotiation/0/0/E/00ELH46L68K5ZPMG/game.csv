"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000? I think that's a fair price that benefits us both.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $850,000? This price still offers a significant value to you and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if this works for you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're not eager to go as low as $700,000. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?  That reflects a willingness to compromise on both our parts.",775000.0,Bob,4,
