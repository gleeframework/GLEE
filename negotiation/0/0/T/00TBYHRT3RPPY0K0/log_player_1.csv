Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can bring the price down a bit.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""its value,"" Alice subtly reminds Bob of the product's worth. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:** Phrases like ""suggesting"" and ""What do you think?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation instead of feeling like he's being given an ultimatum.

**Important Note:**  Alice knows she has a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so she can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob."
