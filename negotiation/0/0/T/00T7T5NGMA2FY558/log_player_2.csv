**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John:**  Alice is selling for $10,000, which is less than John's $12,000 price.
* **The offer is within Bob's budget:** Bob is willing to pay up to $12,000, and Alice's offer is below that.

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best option for Bob, as it saves him $2,000 compared to buying from John."
