{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a great deal to you, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us.  To start, I'm offering it to you for $1,750,000."", ""product_price"": 1750000} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and ensures I don't start too low.
* **Positive Message:** I'm using a positive tone to create a good first impression and build a rapport.  
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value the product holds for Bob, which could make him more inclined to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit high for me. This product is valuable, but I have a budget to stick to. How about we bring the price down a bit? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is an option:** I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,200,000 is still quite a bit below what this product is worth. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer, $1,350,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation continues:** I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm aware that I'm getting closer to my ""sell to John"" threshold.
* **Potential for a deal:** I still believe there's a chance to reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob, so I'm not ready to give up yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I still need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer. 
* **Emphasizing Mutual Benefit:**  I'm highlighting the fact that this price is a compromise, and it would allow both of us to come to an agreement.
* **Approaching the Threshold:**  I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but still have some wiggle room if necessary."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further, how about $1,390,000?  That's a significant investment for me, but I believe this product is worth it.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the threshold:** Bob's offer of $1,390,000 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could continue negotiating, I'm getting close to the point where the potential for a higher price is not worth the risk of a deal falling through.
* **Guaranteed Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and a quick and certain outcome. It's a safer option with less risk."
