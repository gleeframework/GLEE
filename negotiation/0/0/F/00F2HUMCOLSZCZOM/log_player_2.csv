"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $18000 for it. I know it's a bit on the higher end, but I'm confident it will be worth the investment for you.  If you're not interested at that price, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
