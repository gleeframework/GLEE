Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm setting the price at $1,100,000."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could yield more profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,100,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate and potentially settle at a price higher than $800,000 (his perceived value) but lower than $1,200,000.
* **Create a Sense of Urgency:**  By mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""public listing,"" we nudge Bob to act quickly, potentially preventing him from overthinking or lowballing the offer."
