Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 160}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum value, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to make it more appealing to Bob, but still aiming for a price closer to my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is now only $10 below my minimum.  Accepting his offer is the best option at this point, as I'm not sure how many more rounds of counteroffers he'll make before I decide to sell to John."
