# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a price of $1,450,000 is fair and reflects its worth. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.
