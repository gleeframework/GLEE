Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings, and I'm willing to start our negotiations at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's too early to sell to John, I can still try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you see value in this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $950,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below what I'm aiming for.  I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find common ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential value to you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. $1,025,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and is close enough to my ideal price that it's worth closing the deal. It's also better than selling to John for $1,000,000."
