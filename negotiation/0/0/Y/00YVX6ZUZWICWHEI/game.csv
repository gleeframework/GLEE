"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's something truly special, and I believe it has the potential to be a game-changer for your business. I'm confident you'll see the value it brings, and I'm willing to start our negotiations at $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is simply too far below my minimum acceptable price. I understand you see value in this product, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to move forward with the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, Alice. However, $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, so I'll counteroffer at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $950,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find common ground. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
