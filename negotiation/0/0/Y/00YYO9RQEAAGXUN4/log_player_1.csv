Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me, and a fair price for the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from my minimum price of $1,500,000 but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appealing to Bob's interests:** I highlight the value of the product to him and emphasize that this price is a good deal.
* **Positive and open tone:** I use a friendly and encouraging tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 

This strategy aims to get a good price while also keeping Bob engaged and open to further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While it's tempting to accept his offer, it's not financially beneficial for me in the long run.  I will reject his offer and counter with a more reasonable price, hoping to reach a mutually agreeable outcome before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's meet in the middle and see if we can strike a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  I'm offering a counter-price of $1,100,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's offer but still lower than my initial proposal. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while maintaining my minimum acceptable price.
* **Reinforce value for both:** I reiterate the value of the product for both of us to justify the price and encourage Bob to consider it.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** I maintain a friendly tone, inviting Bob to find a compromise and reach a deal.

This approach aims to create a more favorable negotiation point while still keeping Bob engaged and open to finding common ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $1100000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly below my ideal target.  I'm not willing to accept such a low offer, especially since I have a guaranteed buyer in John who will pay my minimum price. 

I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to a price that is more beneficial for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,025,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm offering a price exactly in the middle of my last offer ($1,100,000) and Bob's last offer ($950,000). This demonstrates a genuine commitment to finding a compromise.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I reiterate the value of the product and highlight that this price is fair for both of us. 
* **Finality implied:**  I use language like ""What do you say?"" to subtly suggest that this is my final offer. 

This strategy aims to push Bob towards accepting a price that is closer to my minimum while leaving the door open for a last-minute negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I still think $1025000 is a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $980000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, it's becoming clear that we're too far apart in our valuations.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to result in a price that meets my needs, and it's taking up valuable time.  

Selling to John guarantees me the highest price, ensuring my financial goals are met. It's a more efficient and reliable solution than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
