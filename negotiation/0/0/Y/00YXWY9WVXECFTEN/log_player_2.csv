"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much as possible, and $950,000 is still significantly more than the product's worth to Alice.
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a last resort.**  While it's a safe option, it's not the best financially. 

**Next Steps:**

You will make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round.  Try to get a price closer to her value of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in your product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting with a lower offer:**  This shows Alice that you're serious about negotiating and sets the stage for a potential compromise. 
* **Justifying the price:**  The message highlights the value to both parties, making the offer seem reasonable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  $850,000 is still a significant profit for Alice, so there's space for her to come down a bit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which is a fair compromise. Let's work together to finalize this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While she has come down, $900,000 is still a significant markup from her value of $800,000.
* **Further negotiation is likely.** Alice is willing to negotiate, and you still have 7 rounds to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is still a last resort.**  The risk of failing to reach a deal with Alice is lower than simply buying from John.

**Next Steps:**

You will make a counteroffer to Alice in the next round. Try to get closer to her value of $800,000 while still staying within your budget."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $875,000.  This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Increasing your offer slightly:**  This demonstrates that you're serious about the deal and are willing to compromise. 
* **Staying below Alice's offer:** You are still below her offer of $900,000, but increasing your offer shows flexibility.
* **Focusing on fairness:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the offer, making it more appealing to Alice.

You'll need to see if Alice accepts your counteroffer. If she rejects it, you will have to decide whether to make another counteroffer or try to negotiate further in the next round."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is a significant drop from my previous offer and hopefully we can reach an agreement.  Let's close this deal.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm feeling very close to a deal. However, $890,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $880,000.  This is a great price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal quickly. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 880000}
```

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting frustrated:** This indicates she's nearing her limit and might be less willing to budge further.
