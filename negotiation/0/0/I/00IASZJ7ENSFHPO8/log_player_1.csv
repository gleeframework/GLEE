Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.
* **Your Guarantee:** You have a backup offer from John for $1,000,000.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts the deal. Since you have a guaranteed sale at your minimum, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message Tone:**  Confident, emphasizing the product's value and exclusivity.
* **Price:** $1,150,000  This leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still netting you a significant profit above your minimum and John's offer.

**Why This Works**

* **Value Focus:** You highlight the product's benefits to Bob, justifying the price.
* **Strong Starting Point:** You begin negotiations with a price closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Backup Plan:** Your guaranteed sale to John gives you leverage. 

**Important Notes:**

* **Bob's Response:** Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.  You have some wiggle room to go down in price, but don't go below your $1,000,000 minimum.
* **Confidence is Key:** Present your offer with confidence and be assertive in your valuation."
