"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal for you, considering it's worth $12,000 to you. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $11,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $13,000? This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can make this work.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,500? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, and I can see we're getting close. However, I need to be at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile for me.  Would you be willing to go up to $13,000? It's a small increase and I think we can close the deal here.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd rather go a bit lower than meet you at $13,000. How about $12,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I need to be at least $13,250 to make this work.  It's a small step from your last offer, and I think we can reach an agreement. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my budget, but I still need to save a bit more. How about $12,900? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget.",12900.0,Bob,8,
