Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob could result in greater profit.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for $1,100,000  leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. 
* **Creating Urgency:**  The message implies scarcity and value by mentioning an ""exclusive opportunity"" which might encourage Bob to accept the offer."
