"I'm disappointed that we couldn't meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you the product for $1675000, but only if you're willing to throw in an additional service that I think would greatly enhance the value of the product. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to budge any further. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your continued efforts to find a solution, Alice. I'm willing to consider your latest offer of $1675000 for the product, but I'm unable to commit to the additional service at this time. As such, I would like to propose a price of $1670000 for the product alone. I hope this revised offer is acceptable and allows us to come to a satisfactory agreement.",1670000.0,Bob,8,

"I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'll offer you the product for $1675000, but this is my absolute limit. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",1675000.0,Alice,9,
