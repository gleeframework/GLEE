"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, aiming to maximize my potential profit. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, this first offer is a gamble, but it's a calculated one.  If Bob accepts, great!  If he rejects, it gives me information about his upper limit and allows for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, so I'm rejecting it. I'll use this opportunity to send a counteroffer in the next round.  This will give me more control over the negotiation and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first round, but it's still above my minimum. This counteroffer shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also determined to get a price that reflects the value of the product.  By offering $13,000, I'm giving Bob a chance to meet me halfway without falling below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is slightly higher than his previous one, it's still far below my minimum.  I'm going to reject it again and continue negotiating.  I believe I can secure a better price with further rounds of negotiation.  Selling to John for $12,000 is always an option, but I want to explore if there's more profit potential with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but staying above my minimum. This time, I'm getting closer to my minimum price, signaling to Bob that I'm serious about making a deal.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will entice Bob to accept, but if he rejects, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round.  The clock is ticking, and I need to strike a balance between securing a good price and not risking the deal completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, but it's getting closer. I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement. If this fails, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

This is my final counteroffer.  I'm dropping my price again, but it's still above my minimum. This offer reflects my willingness to negotiate, but I'm running out of time. If Bob rejects this, I'll sell to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While I'd like to get more than $12,000, the negotiation with Bob has reached an impasse.  I've tried to be flexible with my price, but it seems Bob is unwilling to meet me halfway.  It's better to secure a guaranteed $12,000 than risk a potential deal falling through and ending up with nothing."
