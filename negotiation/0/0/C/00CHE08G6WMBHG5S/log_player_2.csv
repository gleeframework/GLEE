"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

It's worth trying to get a lower price from Alice before going with John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concern about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $11,000. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is a good deal for Bob compared to John's offer of $12,000. It's likely that further negotiation would lead to a lower price, but it's not worth the risk of Alice walking away and Bob having to buy from John at a higher price."
