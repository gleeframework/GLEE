Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of this product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?

I'm not comfortable with Bob's counteroffer of $1,000,000. I believe the product is worth more than that and I want to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of what you're getting.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1250000}

While Bob's offer of $1,125,000 is closer to what I'd like, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'll see if I can get him to increase his offer further."

Round 5

Round 6
