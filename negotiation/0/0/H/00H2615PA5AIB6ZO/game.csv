"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, reflecting its premium value. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of this product, but that price is a bit high for me.  How about we bring it down closer to market value?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective on the price, $1,000,000 is simply too low. It doesn't reflect the true value of what you're getting.  Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to reduce my initial offer to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to a reasonable price point.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers to get this deal done.",1125000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to close the deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us to both walk away satisfied. Let's not let this opportunity slip away.",1175000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're right, we're getting close. I'm ready to close this deal today. How about we split the difference between our last offers at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your eagerness to finalize the deal.  We're almost there!  Let's bridge the gap.  I'm willing to come down to $1,162,500. This represents a significant compromise on my part, but it's the closest I can come without sacrificing my bottom line.  Let's get this done.",1162500.0,Alice,7,
