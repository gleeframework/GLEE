"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's in great condition and worth a lot more. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a good middle ground - it's higher than my minimum but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build some rapport with Bob by making a positive comment about the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to get a good price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $110?  This is still a great price for a product worth much more."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with $110. This is still above my minimum and leaves some room for negotiation, but it's a more reasonable starting point than Bob's offer. I'm also reiterating the value of the product to encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about we meet in the middle at $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $105 is a good deal.  While I can still try to get a little more, I've already rejected his offer twice, and I don't want to risk losing him completely. $105 is more than what I'd get from John, and it's closer to my ideal price.  I'll accept his offer."
