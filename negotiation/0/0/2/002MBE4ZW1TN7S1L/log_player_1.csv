Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  However, $1,500,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'm happy to discuss the product further, but I'd like to start at $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.
