"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its value. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I think the product is worth less to me than $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,200,000, which is the price I'm willing to pay for the product. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value.  While $1,800,000 represents its full potential, I'm willing to adjust to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. How about we meet closer to the middle ground at $1,500,000?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit higher than $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  Let's find a solution â€“ how about $1,425,000? This reflects the value while acknowledging your price considerations.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, but I think $1,425,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle of my target price and your last offer, which is $1,350,000. Can you consider this price?",1350000.0,Bob,6,
