"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to lower the price to $95? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate you're working within a budget, $95 is unfortunately too low for me. Would you consider $105? That would still be a good price for you, and it would allow me to make a reasonable profit.",105.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could we possibly agree on $100 for the product? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
