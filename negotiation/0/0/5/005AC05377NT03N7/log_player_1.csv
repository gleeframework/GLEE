Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $120. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $80, we start with a price higher than his valuation. This leaves room for negotiation or acceptance if Bob perceives the product's value differently.
* **Above Bob, Below John:** The $120 price is strategically placed above Bob's valuation but comfortably below John's guaranteed purchase price. This maximizes potential profit while still making the offer potentially appealing to Bob. 
* **Clear and Concise:** The message is straightforward, mentioning the product and offering a direct price without revealing too much about its worth to you. 
 
This strategy aims to find a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a profit and ensuring a guaranteed sale to John if Bob declines."
