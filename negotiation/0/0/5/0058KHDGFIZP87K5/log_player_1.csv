Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $14,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, and still allows you to potentially earn more than John's offer.
* **Confidence:** The message is framed positively, highlighting the product's value and making Bob feel like he's getting a special deal. 
 
This approach balances risk and reward. While there's a chance Bob could reject the offer, it gives you the highest potential profit while still having a safety net with John."
