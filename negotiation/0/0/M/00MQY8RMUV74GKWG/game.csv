"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product.  However, $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd be willing to pay $900000. This is a fair price considering your value for the product, and it still leaves room for a profitable transaction for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $900000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1100000. This is a fair compromise that still allows for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1100000 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still looking to get a slightly better deal. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm prepared to offer $1000000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it, and it allows for a significant profit margin for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer of $1000000, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1050000. This is the best price I can offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
