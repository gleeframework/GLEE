"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is attractive, but not the best.**  While $950,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get it for less. 
* **Negotiation is worth the effort.** By rejecting and counter-offering, Bob has the chance to drive the price down even further.
* **The alternative is not ideal.** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but it's less advantageous than potentially getting a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant counteroffer.** A $50,000 drop from Alice's initial offer shows Bob is serious about negotiating and signals a willingness to walk away.
* **Stay within Bob's budget.**  $900,000 is still below Bob's maximum price, leaving room for further negotiation. 
* **Leave room for compromise.** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and Alice's desired price, creating space for potential agreements in the following rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer, but not ideal.** $975,000 is a better price than her initial offer, but still slightly higher than Bob's desired price point.
* **The negotiation process is still worth the effort.**  By rejecting and continuing to counter-offer, Bob has the opportunity to push for a lower price.
* **The alternative remains less attractive.** Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a sure thing, but the potential for a better deal with Alice is still present."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase.** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise but also maintains a firm stance on wanting a lower price. It's a $50,000 increase from Bob's last offer, which is a reasonable step towards meeting Alice's midpoint.
* **Staying within budget.** $925,000 remains within Bob's budget, leaving room for potential concessions in the future.
* **Maintaining the negotiation process.** By continuing to negotiate, Bob keeps the pressure on Alice and increases the possibility of securing a better deal than buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $962,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $962,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is getting closer.**  While it's not Bob's ideal price, it's now only $37,500 above his initial counteroffer and represents a significant drop from Alice's starting point.
* **Limited time and risk of losing the deal.**  With only five rounds remaining, the risk of Alice getting a better offer from someone else or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price becomes more significant. 
* **A good compromise.**  $962,500 is a reasonable compromise, considering the potential risks of continuing the negotiation and the possibility of needing to resort to John's offer."
