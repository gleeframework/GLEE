Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $200. I think it's a great deal, what do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 200
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $200 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $150, which is fair for both of us. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches his valuation, I know I can get my minimum asking price from John. There's no guarantee Bob will go higher, so it's best to take the sure thing."
