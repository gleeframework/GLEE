,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately $12000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $13000. This still leaves a lot of profit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great deal. Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still unable to meet at $13000. My maximum offer remains at $12000. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
