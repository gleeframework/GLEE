"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Considering its value to me, I'm willing to pay $850,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market value of similar products.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $900,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
