Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a good starting point. It's a reasonable price that leaves room for negotiation, but still above my minimum value for the product.  By framing it as a great deal for Bob, it might incentivize him to accept rather than immediately counter-offering."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $125 is above Bob's stated value for the product, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'll reject his offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $125 is a good offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $140? It's still a great deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate the quality of the product, but I am unable to meet the current offer. Could we possibly settle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $135 is still a decent profit and above my minimum value. It's likely that further negotiation will only lead to more time wasted, and potentially to Bob walking away entirely.  Accepting his offer is the best way to secure a sale and move on."
