"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still lower than I'm comfortable with.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,700,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts in this negotiation, but to be honest, your latest offer is a little disappointing. I'm working with a tight margin here, and I have other potential buyers. If we can't agree on a price closer to $1,850,000, I may have to explore those other options.",1850000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $1,650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, but I think this is the maximum I can go.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
