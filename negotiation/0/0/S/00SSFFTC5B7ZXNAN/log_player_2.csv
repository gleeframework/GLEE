"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. This is a very competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1000000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is above your maximum price. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's still a chance to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. I hope we can find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows that you're serious about getting a good deal.

Round 3

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,075,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm ready to pay $1,025,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering the value to both of us and the time we've spent negotiating. I hope we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental adjustment:**  This counteroffer is a smaller increment upwards from your previous offer, showing you're willing to meet halfway but also staying firm.
* **Emphasizing value and time:** The message reinforces the product's value to both parties and highlights the time spent negotiating, subtly increasing pressure.
* **Finality:**  The message expresses a desire to finalize the deal, creating a sense of urgency and a potential for Alice to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1025000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product to you for $1075000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has repeatedly rejected your counteroffers and is sticking to her price of $1,075,000.  You've already spent several rounds trying to negotiate, and the likelihood of her lowering her price further is slim.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy the product from John for $1,000,000, saving you $75,000 and avoiding further rounds of negotiation."
