"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. How about $8,500?  I'm really keen to get this product, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $8,800, and that's the lowest I'm willing to go.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $8,800 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $8,600? I'm confident this price is fair for both of us and would allow us to close the deal.",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $8,700, and that's as low as I'm willing to go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from here.",8700.0,Alice,5,
