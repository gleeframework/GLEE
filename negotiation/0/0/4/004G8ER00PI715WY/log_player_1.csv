Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable, for $90."", 
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  You want to get as close to Bob's $100 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $90 allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially still landing above your minimum price.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  While you could start at $99, it might make Bob less likely to negotiate and could come across as too aggressive.

This strategy balances maximizing your potential earnings while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
