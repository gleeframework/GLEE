"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product and would be willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is my best offer, let me know what you think.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm confident that this product is worth more than that, given its potential return on investment. I could meet you halfway at $1,375,000. This is a fair offer considering the product's value.",1375000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,375,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm prepared to go to $1,300,000,  I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value we both see in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
