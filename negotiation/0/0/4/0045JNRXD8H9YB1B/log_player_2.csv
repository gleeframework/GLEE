"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product today. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the benefits it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $12,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? This would still be a great deal for you considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is closer to his ideal price, he can likely still negotiate a lower price. There's still room for both parties to make concessions."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $13,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  Let's split the difference and meet at $12,500.  This would be a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
