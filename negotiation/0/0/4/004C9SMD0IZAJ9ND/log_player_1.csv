Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counteroffer. This allows me to see how interested he is in the product and where his ""sweet spot"" price might be. If he rejects, I'll adjust my counteroffer based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $10,000. I'll counteroffer with a price that's still above Bob's offer, but lower than my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm offering $10,500. This is a compromise, acknowledging Bob's interest while still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this price is fair, given my minimum and his value for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John. Bob's latest offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not confident I can get him to go any higher. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, and it's a faster and more certain outcome."
