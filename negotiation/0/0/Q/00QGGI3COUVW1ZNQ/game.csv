"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a considerable amount to me, so I'm asking for $900,000.  I believe this price reflects the product's value and offers you a great opportunity.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given the value you placed on it, I'm willing to offer $750,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal considering the product's worth.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? This would be a good deal for both of us.",825000.0,Bob,4,
