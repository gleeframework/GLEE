Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still not quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,750?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
