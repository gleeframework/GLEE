Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since I know Bob values the product at $120, I want to start with a price higher than that to see if I can secure a better deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $150 offer leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.  
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm not overly aggressive because I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $120. This gives me a good fallback position."
