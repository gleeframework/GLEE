Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. However, my maximum budget remains at $1,000,000. I am unable to increase my offer. I hope we can still find a way to come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has made it clear he won't budge past $1,000,000.  There's no point in further negotiation. Taking John's offer ensures we get our minimum acceptable price and avoids wasting further time/rounds."
