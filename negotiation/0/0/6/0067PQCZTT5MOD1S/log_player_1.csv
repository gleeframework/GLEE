Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price,  leaving room for negotiation.  It's also friendly and emphasizes the product's value to entice Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $10000 is a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $8000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I can sell the product to John for the same amount immediately. There's no benefit in further negotiation, as it's unlikely Bob will increase his offer, and I risk losing time and potentially a sale to John."
