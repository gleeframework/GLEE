Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer is too low. I can do better by continuing to negotiate or selling to John, who is still willing to pay $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $10,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Considering my budget, could you possibly lower the price to $10,500? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm still holding out for a better price. Although Bob has increased his offer, it's still below my minimum of $10,000. I'll see if I can negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $10,750? This is a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal without further delay.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Could you consider lowering the price to $10,600? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,600

Bob's offer of $10,600 is slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and potential delays."
