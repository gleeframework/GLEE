"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept this price. I'm aiming to gauge his willingness to negotiate and see how much room there is for a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum value. I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer but still above my minimum value. I believe this price is reasonable considering Bob's offer and my desire to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still below my minimum value, and I have a backup buyer in John. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still above my minimum. I'm hoping this offer will be appealing enough to Bob to convince him to close the deal, as we are nearing the halfway point of our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer finally matches my minimum value.  While I'd prefer to sell to John for a higher price, it's getting late in the negotiations and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether. I'm accepting Bob's offer to secure the sale."
