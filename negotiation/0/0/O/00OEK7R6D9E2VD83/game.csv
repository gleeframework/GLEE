"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $1,500,000.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a $200,000 reduction from my initial offer. I believe this price still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I can only afford $1,150,000 right now. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you a decent profit while keeping me within my budget. What do you think?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,150,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $1,250,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,250,000. It's getting close to what I can afford.  However, I can only go up to $1,200,000 at this time.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. It's a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
