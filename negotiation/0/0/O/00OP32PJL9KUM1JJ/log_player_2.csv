Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $9,000 is a good deal for Bob, and it's also a good price for Alice.  Any further negotiation could risk Alice walking away, and then Bob would be forced to buy from John for $10,000."
