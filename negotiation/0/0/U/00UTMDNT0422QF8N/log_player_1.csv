Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and it leaves some room for you to profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. What do you say?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.

Round 8
