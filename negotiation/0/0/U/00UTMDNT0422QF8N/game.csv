"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's still a good price for me. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate that you're willing to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. It's a fair price, and it leaves some room for you to profit. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which still allows me to make a decent profit. Let's meet in the middle.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a good deal. What do you say?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This price is a good compromise for both of us, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's close the deal.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $10,500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my commitment to reaching an agreement.  This price allows us both to make a reasonable gain. What do you think?",9800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,800 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a good compromise. Let's make this deal happen. If we can't agree on this price, I'll have to explore other options.",10200.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,200 is still a bit beyond what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $9,900, which is a considerable increase from my previous offer. This shows my genuine interest in finalizing this deal. Let's find a solution that benefits both of us. What do you think?",9900.0,Bob,8,
