Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. It's a great deal and I think you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) but still lower than my minimum ($15,000). This allows for negotiation and potential compromise.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and optimistic, aiming to build rapport and encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By starting at $14,500, I have room to negotiate down if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I have John's offer of $15,000 gives me leverage and allows me to walk away from a deal that's too low."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,500 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $12,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While I'm not willing to accept Bob's offer, I can still negotiate further. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John will pay $15,000 gives me confidence to reject Bob's low offer.  I'm not desperate for a sale and can continue to negotiate with Bob or move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? This would give you a good deal and still allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise and Flexibility:** I'm offering a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Logic:** I'm using logical reasoning to justify the price.  ""Meeting in the middle"" suggests fairness and a potential win-win scenario.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  $13,500 is still above my minimum, and I'm not completely giving in to Bob's initial offer. This maintains my leverage in the negotiation."
