"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with a higher price than your minimum acceptable offer. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting with $2,200,000, we set a high anchor in Bob's mind. Even if he rejects this initial offer, it might influence his counteroffer to be higher than if we started lower.
* **Confidence:** A strong opening offer conveys confidence in the product's value.

We are aware that this is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.  The following rounds will involve carefully analyzing his responses and adjusting our strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the value you see in this product, but I'm a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is better than our guaranteed offer from John ($1,500,000). However, we still have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our desired price. We'll aim for a counteroffer that falls between our initial ask and Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and recognizing the value this product offers. While your initial offer is a bit too low, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet halfway at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  This approach can signal a willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By proposing $1,900,000, we're still significantly above Bob's offer and slightly closer to our starting point. This leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:** We're subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit constrained by my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met John's offer, but we still believe the product is worth more. We are willing to take a slight risk to try and secure a higher price from Bob, but we need to be cautious. Bob seems fixated on the $1,500,000 mark.  We will counter with a price just above this to test his willingness to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I must be honest, $1,500,000 is the absolute lowest I can go for this product. I'm willing to make that concession in the spirit of our negotiations, but I can't go any lower."",
""product_price"": 1550000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm at a price slightly above Bob's last offer to signal that we're reaching our limit while still showing some flexibility. 
* **Sense of Urgency:** By stating this is our absolute lowest, we aim to encourage Bob to make a decision. 
* **Justification:** We're emphasizing this is a concession on our part, subtly reminding him of the product's value.

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob accepts:** We secure a price slightly above John's offer.
2. **Bob counters:**  This will give us valuable information about his true willingness to pay. We can then decide if we want to continue negotiating or accept John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still trying to get as close to my budget as possible. I'm willing to pay $1,495,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to accept? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,495,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,495,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly unwilling to meet our minimum price. His latest offer of $1,495,000 is below John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  

Continuing negotiations at this point is unlikely to result in a significantly better offer from Bob. We've been firm, and he seems to be playing a very cautious game. 

Therefore, the best course of action is to accept John's offer and secure the guaranteed $1,500,000."
