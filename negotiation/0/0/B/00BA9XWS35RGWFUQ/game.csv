,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $135. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",135.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $110 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about we meet at $130? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product!",130.0,Alice,5,
