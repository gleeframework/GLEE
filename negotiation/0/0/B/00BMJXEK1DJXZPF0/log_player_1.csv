Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is strategic for the following reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than John's offer:**  This ensures you maximize your potential earnings.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:** Bob is still getting a good deal, making him more likely to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob counters, you have wiggle room to potentially reach an even higher price.

This approach balances maximizing your profit with securing the deal, as you still have a guaranteed sale with John if Bob rejects."
