"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $100 is a bit high for you, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $90. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering Alice. I'm getting closer, but $90 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about $70?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to give a bit more, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about $85? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  $85 is still a little more than I was hoping to spend. How about we split the difference and do $75?",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $75, so how about $80? It's the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it's a fair price for both of us.",80.0,Alice,7,
