"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning:  Bob can likely get a better deal than $9,000.  He should try to negotiate with Alice first before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

Reasoning: Bob knows the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so he's offering a price slightly above that.  He's trying to get a good deal, but also leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: Alice's offer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue to negotiate with Alice to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}
```

Reasoning: Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing willingness to negotiate but still keeping the price below his maximum.  This also leaves room for Alice to counter if she's willing to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reasoning: While Alice is coming down slightly, her offer is still too high for Bob. He can likely negotiate a better price and should continue to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8900}
```

Reasoning: Bob is again increasing his offer slightly, showing flexibility and continuing to negotiate. This offer is still significantly lower than Alice's previous offer, leaving room for her to come down further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Reasoning:  Alice is not willing to come down much further. It's becoming clear that Bob is not going to get the product for significantly less than $9,500.  At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John for $10,000, as he has a maximum price of $10,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks running out of rounds and having to buy from John at a higher price."
