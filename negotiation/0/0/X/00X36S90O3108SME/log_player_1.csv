Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering Bob the product for $14,000. This is a good starting point as it's above his perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product. If he rejects, I can then assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worth continuing the negotiation or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $12,000 is too low for me, as I'm willing to take $15,000 from John. I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}

I'm counteroffering Bob at $13,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still giving me a decent profit.  I believe this is a fair price, given the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting too low for me.  I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,000, and it seems he's not willing to go any higher. I'm better off selling to John at $15,000 and ensuring I get a profit that meets my minimum requirements."
