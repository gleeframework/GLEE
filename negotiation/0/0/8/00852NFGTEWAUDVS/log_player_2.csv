While $9,000 is a good price, I can potentially do better.  Rejecting allows me to see if Alice is willing to come down further."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer,  offering $8,500. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer, but still above her value of $8,000. I want to see if she's willing to budge."

**Reasoning:**

Alice has increased her offer slightly, but it's still above my ideal price. I'm not willing to accept yet, as I believe I can still negotiate a better price. I will counter again in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is pushing the price back up, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. I'm willing to take a few more rounds to try and get a better deal.  I'm getting closer to John's price, but I still believe I can do better with Alice."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, but still below Alice's current price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and show that I'm willing to meet her halfway. With only 4 rounds remaining, I want to see if we can reach an agreement before I need to consider John's offer."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm not willing to give in yet. I want to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get a better price. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider John's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer to $9,250. This is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, but it's still below her price point. I only have two rounds left, so I need to make a move that shows I'm serious about buying from her while still staying within my budget.  I'm hoping that this final push will convince her to accept."
