"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You have a maximum budget of $15,000 and Alice's offer is $14,000. This is within your budget, but you want to save as much money as possible.
* Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price.  
* You can always fall back to John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping for.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $14,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice has lowered her price to $13,500, which is still within your budget and a good deal. 
* You can save $1,500 compared to buying from John.
*  While you could continue negotiating, there's a good chance Alice will not go lower, and you could end up paying more from John."
