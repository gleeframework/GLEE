"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really like.  I'm asking for $115 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You're looking to save as much as possible, so rejecting the first offer is the best strategy to potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $105? "", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $105 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $110. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
You can still potentially get a better deal than $110, as Alice is willing to negotiate.  Rejecting her offer keeps the negotiation going."

Round 4

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference at $107.50?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
