"I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about I offer the product for $72, which is a slight increase from my previous proposal. This still saves you some money compared to its value to you, while allowing us to reach an agreement.",72.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $72 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $71?",71.0,Bob,4,
