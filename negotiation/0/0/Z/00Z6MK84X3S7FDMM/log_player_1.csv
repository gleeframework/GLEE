Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I've given this some more thought, Alice. Considering the product's value, I'd like to propose an offer of $800,000. This seems to be closer to the actual value and within your comfort zone. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. It's better to secure the deal now at $800,000 than risk him lowering his offer or walking away in future rounds."
