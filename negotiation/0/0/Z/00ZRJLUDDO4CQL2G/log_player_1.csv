Round 2
Bob's offer:

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $1,200,000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,150,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

``` 

While getting a higher price would be ideal, Bob is unlikely to budge much higher. Accepting the $1,150,000 offer secures a significant profit over John's $800,000 and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds."
