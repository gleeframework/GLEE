I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $140 is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! I can come down a bit, but $140 is a bit too low for me. How about $160? That's still a good deal for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 160}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. Would you be willing to consider a price of $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to sell to John. While Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum, I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from him. John is offering me my minimum, and there's no reason to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
