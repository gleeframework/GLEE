"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $110. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",110.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal!",125.0,Alice,3,
