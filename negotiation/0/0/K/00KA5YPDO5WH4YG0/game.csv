"Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000.  This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal now!",14000.0,Alice,5,
