"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe will be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $18,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  $18,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $12,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'm going to counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price range.  I have 8 rounds left, so I have room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,000 is just too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need a higher price, but $15,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair offer, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  However, I'm close to my desired price range and I have 6 rounds left.  I'm going to counteroffer again, hoping to find a middle ground.  I'm confident I can get a better price than this, and I don't want to risk selling to John for $15,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $13,000.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000.  This is a fair price, and it gives us both a good deal.  Let's close this deal now!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
