"Hi Alice, $170 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is $80. Would you be willing to negotiate down to that price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $80 isn't feasible for me, I'm willing to come down to $120. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $100. This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to get a fair price.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 doesn't cover my costs.  How about we split the difference and go with $110? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to sell the product without taking a big loss.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $110 is still a bit too high. How about we settle on $95? This would be a great deal for both of us, and it would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget.",95.0,Bob,6,
