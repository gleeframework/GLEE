"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $120 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $150 is still a bit above my budget. Can you consider $130? I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is still not a good enough deal for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers, at $140.  This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",140.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $140, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Can we try $135? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Bob,6,
