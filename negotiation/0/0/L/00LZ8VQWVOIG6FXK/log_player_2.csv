"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

This product is well within your budget, and Alice's offer is a good starting point.  It's always a good idea to accept an offer that is within your range, especially in the first round, as it shows you are interested in the product and allows for potential negotiation in future rounds if needed."
