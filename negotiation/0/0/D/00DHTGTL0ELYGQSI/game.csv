"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $13250. This is a significant reduction from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your last offer and my initial counteroffer. Can you consider $12750?",12750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway *again*, at $13000.  This would be a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Alice,5,
