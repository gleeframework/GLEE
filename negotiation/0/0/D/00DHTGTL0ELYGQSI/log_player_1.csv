This offer is above Bob's valuation but below your minimum. This is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I want to see if I can push for a higher price before selling to John."

At this point, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not enough. I've already made several concessions and I don't want to keep going back and forth. John is offering me my minimum price, so I'm going to sell to him and avoid further negotiation."
