"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing my potential value for this product.  However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if that works for you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your prompt response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. While I initially offered it at $12,000, I am willing to meet you halfway. Therefore, I propose we finalize the deal at $11,000. This still allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still just a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm prepared to pay $10,500.  This represents a good deal for both of us - it's closer to your desired price than my initial offer, and it fits within my budget.  What do you think?",10500.0,Bob,4,
