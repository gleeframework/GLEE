Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you recognizing my potential value for this product.  However,  $12,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $10,000, which is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay.  Let me know if that works for you.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,000 is still just a bit outside of my budget.  I'm really keen on getting this product, and I'm prepared to pay $10,500.  This represents a good deal for both of us - it's closer to your desired price than my initial offer, and it fits within my budget.  What do you think?
