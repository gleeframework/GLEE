"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $95. I think it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Reason: Alice's offer is quite high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since the product's value for Alice is much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $95 seems a bit steep.  Would you consider $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

Reason: I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a price well below my $100 maximum and closer to Alice's perceived value of $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Reason: While $85 is better than the initial offer, it's still above Alice's value for the item. There's room to negotiate further and try to get closer to $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine, and settle on $77?"", 
""product_price"": 77
}
```

Reason:  I'm proposing a compromise that moves closer to Alice's price point while still trying to secure a good deal. This approach shows willingness to negotiate while staying firm on getting a price below $80."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm enjoying our little negotiation, Bob, but I need to get closer to my desired price. How about $81? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reason: Alice has signaled this is her final offer, and the price of $81 is quite reasonable, falling between her value ($80) and my maximum ($100). It's unlikely further negotiation will yield a significantly better price, and risking the deal by going back and forth might lead to Alice walking away."
