"Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I believe will be highly valuable to your business. While I understand its worth to you is around $800,000, I'm willing to offer it to you at a price of $1,000,000.  This represents a significant discount from its true value to me, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
