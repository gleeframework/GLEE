Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a fantastic deal, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $90 is within his budget, it's still more than he'd like to pay. He'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $90 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $85 for it."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product for $87.50. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has lowered her price to $87.50, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him. Accepting this offer will save Bob $2.50 compared to buying from John. While Bob could potentially try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice might reject his next offer or increase her price again. Accepting now secures a good deal for Bob."
