"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12000 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be open to $9000?  I believe that's a fair price considering my budget and the value of this product to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer for now. While $9,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While $9,000 is a good starting point, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This would still be a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $10500 is closer, I'm still looking to stay within my budget. Would you be open to $9500?  This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While $9,500 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I'll try to negotiate a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise.  This is a great deal for you, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway.  However, $10000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9750, which is as high as I can go without exceeding my budget. This would be a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. It's getting close with Bob, but I've only got 4 rounds left and I'm still not at my desired price point.  I'm not confident I'll be able to get a better offer from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's better to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
