"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $9,000 to be comfortable with the sale.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford.  Could we agree on $7,500? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $9,500. I can see the value in the product, and I believe it's worth more than $7,500.",9500.0,Alice,5,
