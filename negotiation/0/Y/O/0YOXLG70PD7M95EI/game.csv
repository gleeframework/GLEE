"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the potential, $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $900000 for the product, given its unique nature and my budget. I'm confident this offer is fair, and I'm hoping we can find common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1000000. This price still reflects the product's value and leaves room for both of us to benefit.  I'm confident this is a fair compromise. Let me know if you're open to this.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
