"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

Let's reason through this counteroffer:

* **Strategy:** We're aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but leaving room for negotiation to reach a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Justification:** Starting low shows Alice we're serious about getting a good deal. It also allows for potential compromises later in the negotiation. 
* **Alternative:** A less aggressive counteroffer could be around $70, but this initial lowball tests Alice's flexibility."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is moving closer to our desired price range, but we're still above our ideal budget.
* Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open and gives us an opportunity to inch closer to $80 or at least a price that's more appealing than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, Alice.  $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you maybe do $70? That would be a good compromise."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** We're acknowledging Alice's willingness to negotiate by moving closer to her price.
* **Target:** Our offer of $70 aims to split the difference between her last offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($60). 
* **Alternative:** We could have gone with $75, but $70 puts more pressure on Alice and leaves us some room to negotiate further if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $75?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** Alice has come down to $75, which is a $5 saving compared to John's offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate might push Alice away, or she might not budge much further. It's not worth risking the $75 deal for a potential saving of a few dollars. 
* **Time Value:**  Negotiation takes time and effort. Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price."
