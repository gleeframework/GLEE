Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  Bob values the product at $80, so he might be willing to pay a bit more.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $120, so this gives you room to negotiate.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** If Bob rejects this offer, you have room to lower the price slightly. 

Remember, the goal is to maximize your earnings while still potentially making a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit high for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  While it's tempting to accept and get rid of the product, it's important to remember your minimum value is $120. Selling to Bob for $60 would result in a significant loss.  It's better to reject his offer and see if we can reach a more acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $85? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  $85 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend.  Could you maybe do $70? That would be a good compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $70 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your desired profit margin.  You can likely squeeze a bit more out of Bob. It's better to reject his offer and see if a slightly higher counteroffer might be successful."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $75?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 75}
