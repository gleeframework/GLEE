"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $115. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $100 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $110? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $110. How about $105?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is still a bit below what I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. How about $107.50? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, as I mentioned before, but I'm not willing to go any higher. Can you meet me at $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
