"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than the product's worth to Bob ($900,000 vs. $800,000). This gives me room to negotiate and potentially achieve a higher price.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to start the negotiation on a positive note. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm subtly mentioning the product's value to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 

**Remember:**  This is just the first round. I'll adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I'm not ready to sell to John yet. There's room for further negotiation with Bob. I believe I can potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  I'll counteroffer Bob in the next round, aiming to bridge the gap between our positions while staying above my minimum."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
