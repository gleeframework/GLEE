"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm prepared to sell for $13,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. Would you consider $12,800? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal!",12800.0,Alice,5,
