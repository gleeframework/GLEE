Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's estimated value to maximize my profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  $14,000 is a good starting point because it leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without making me feel like I need to immediately sell to John. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a positive tone and emphasizing the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I can likely get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.  There's still room for negotiation.
* **John is a secure option:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a guarantee, but I'm willing to risk a little to see if I can get closer to that price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a bit. However, $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm prepared to sell for $13,000. This price still gives you a good deal, considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable compromise:**  $13,000 is a compromise from my initial offer of $14,000, but it's still above Bob's offer and closer to my desired price.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive and open tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:**  While $12,500 is closer to my ideal price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiating room remains:**  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, as there's still a chance he might come closer to my desired price.
* **Secure option with John:**  I'm confident that I can get a better price with Bob, and I'm willing to risk a little more time to see if I can get closer to my ideal price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,500 is still a bit low for me. Would you consider $12,800? This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 12800}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only asking for $300 more than Bob's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm still highlighting the product's value to justify my price.
* **Positive and Closing Tone:** I'm using language that suggests a closing deal, encouraging Bob to accept. 
* **Strategic Price Point:** $12,800 is close enough to Bob's offer that he might be willing to accept, but still higher than my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not losing out too much."
