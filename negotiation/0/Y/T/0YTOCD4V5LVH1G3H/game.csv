"I understand you're looking to save some money, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need $12000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",12000.0,Alice,3,,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob! I can see you're really interested in the product. I'm willing to come down to $11000, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,,
