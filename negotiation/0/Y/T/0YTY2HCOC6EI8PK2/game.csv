"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me right now.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, given the value this product brings.  What do you think? ",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $9,500 is still a bit high for me, I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value I'll get from the product.  What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $9,000. However, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Given the value this product brings to you, I believe $9,250 would be a fair price. It reflects both our needs and allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While I value the product, $9,250 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  This would be a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",9100.0,Bob,6,
