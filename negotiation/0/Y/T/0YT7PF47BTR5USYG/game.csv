"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $15000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13500. This is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13500 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000, and I think that's a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can make this happen.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $11000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12800.

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $12800 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11500. This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we both place on the product. What do you say?",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $11500, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product at that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $12400. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value it brings. What do you think?",12400.0,Alice,7,
