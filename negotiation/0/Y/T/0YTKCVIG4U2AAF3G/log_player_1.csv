Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a steal at $145. I know you'll find it valuable, and this is a limited-time offer."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you'd accept $150 from John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could net you a better profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows a buffer for potential negotiation if Bob tries to haggle the price down. 
* **Urgency:**  Adding a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer."
