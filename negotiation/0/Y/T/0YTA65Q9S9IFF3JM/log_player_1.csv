Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm going to start by offering the product to Bob at my minimum price of $120. This is the price I value the product at, and it's worth testing if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $110 is closer to my desired price, I still have the option to sell to John for $120. I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm going to counter with $115. This is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but $108 is still too low.  Since I have a guaranteed sale to John for $120, I'm going to sell the product to him.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than settling for less than my minimum."
