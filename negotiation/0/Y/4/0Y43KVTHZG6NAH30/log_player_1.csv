This offer gives me a good chance of earning a decent amount of money, as it is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of the product.  However, it is also lower than my minimum acceptable value, leaving me room to negotiate if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is my best offer, but I'm open to discussing it further. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a good price, but $950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.
