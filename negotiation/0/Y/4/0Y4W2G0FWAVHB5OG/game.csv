"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this high-quality item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget, but $18,000 is a bit more than I can comfortably afford. I'm happy to consider purchasing the product for $12,000, which is my maximum price point.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $12,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $16,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is the absolute highest I can afford. Let's try to come to an agreement on this number.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. I'm willing to make a small concession and offer the product to you for $15,500. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $15,500 is still a bit higher than I can go. I'm sticking to my previous offer of $14,000. It's my absolute maximum, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I might need to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to be transparent about your budget. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $14,000, as it's below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",15000.0,Alice,7,
