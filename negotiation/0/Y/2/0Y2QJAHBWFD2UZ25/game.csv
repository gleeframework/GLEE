"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is your top price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $10500. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $8000. I'm open to further negotiation, but I need to stay within my target profit margin.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've made several concessions, and I'm starting to think we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Please let me know if this is acceptable to you.",10000.0,Bob,8,
