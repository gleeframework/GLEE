"Hello Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $1,050,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could you do $925,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $925,000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,025,000.
