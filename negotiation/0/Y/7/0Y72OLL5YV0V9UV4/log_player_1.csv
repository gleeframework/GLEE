{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's above my minimum value ($100) but still leaves room for negotiation. It's also less than Bob's perceived value, making it more likely he'll accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $130 is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to go down to $115?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $115 is better than my minimum, I believe I can still get closer to my ideal price.  I'll counter with a slightly lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $115 is a bit too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $122.50?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 122.50} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $122.50 is still a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle again at $120? It's a fair price for both of us, and it would be a good deal for you as well. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $120 is still a good deal and above my minimum. It's important to remember that Bob is the only buyer currently willing to pay more than John, and it's in my best interest to close this deal now."
