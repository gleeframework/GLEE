Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its potential benefits to you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) sets a strong anchor. While $1,300,000 is ambitious, it leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob's perceived value seem like a ""deal"" if he manages to haggle it down.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell to Bob, allowing for a more confident negotiation stance. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits,"" the message subtly shifts focus away from pure price and towards the perceived value the product offers Bob.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters.
* Gauge Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly.  If he seems completely turned off by the initial price, you might need to make more significant concessions."
