{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to save as much money as possible, so I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $850,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  Considering the price from another seller, I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 700000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to reduce the price to $775000. This is a very competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $775,000, which is significantly closer to my ideal price of $700,000.  While there's always room for negotiation, it's likely that Alice won't go much lower, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  Accepting her offer is the best option to ensure I get the product and save a good amount of money."
