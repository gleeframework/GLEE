Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary, while still exceeding my minimum value for the product.  I'll see if Bob is interested!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it. I'm still hoping to get a better price, and I'm confident I can do better than $7,500. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm countering with $9,000. It's a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $7,000 is getting too close to my minimum, and I'm not confident I can get a higher price. I'm going to sell to John for $8,000 to ensure I don't lose out on a reasonable profit."
