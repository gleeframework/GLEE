"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think.",100.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget to stick to.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $90?  I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $85? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",85.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $90, but that's my final offer.  It's a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's close this deal!",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $90, but I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $87.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",87.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $87.50 is still too low for me.  Let's compromise one last time: I'll drop the price to $89. This is my final offer. If we don't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",89.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $89 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more serious offer: $88. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me here.",88.0,Bob,8,
