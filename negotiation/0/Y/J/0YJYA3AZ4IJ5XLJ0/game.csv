"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. I'm willing to make a reasonable offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'll counter with $11500. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to you.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $11000. Can you consider this revised offer?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad you're willing to compromise, Bob, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous counteroffer, so I'll counter with $11750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value the product holds.",11750.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11500. Considering we're already at a price that's close to my minimum, I'm willing to make a small concession and counter with $12200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",12200.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've gone as low as I can, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm offering one final counteroffer of $12000. If you're willing to meet me here, I'll consider the deal. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",12000.0,Bob,10,
