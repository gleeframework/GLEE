"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
