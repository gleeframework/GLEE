"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique and valuable item that I'm confident you'll find useful. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice, as you can potentially save some money.  You can try a counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm definitely interested,  $12,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $9,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I'm still confident that the product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than $12,000, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay. You should continue negotiating with Alice to see if you can get a lower price.  It's also important to remember that John is willing to sell the product for $10,000, so you have a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm very interested in this product and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.  Let's split the difference. How about $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your desire to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer you a slight concession, but I think $10,800 is the lowest I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice has come down to $10,800, which is still more than your target of $10,000.  You've negotiated hard, but you're getting closer to your limit.  At this point, it's smarter to just buy from John.  You're guaranteed to get the product at your target price."
