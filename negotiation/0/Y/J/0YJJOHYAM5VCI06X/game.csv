"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $750,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $825,000 to show you I'm serious about making this work. Let's find a price that's fair for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still a bit above my target budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer $775,000 for the product. Let's see if we can make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit below my minimum, but I'm willing to make a final concession.  I'll accept $790,000 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I think it reflects a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think.",790000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid $790,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $775,000, as I mentioned before. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm starting to consider buying the product from John for $800,000. Let's meet at $775,000 and make a deal.",775000.0,Bob,6,
