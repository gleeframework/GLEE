"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great price considering the product's value and quality. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is still too high, as he is willing to pay up to $15,000, but wants to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer will give him a chance to negotiate a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. While $11,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, Bob is still hoping to save more money. He can continue to negotiate with Alice and see if they can reach a price closer to his target."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and gets me closer to my goal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept the offer.  He's already negotiated the price down significantly from Alice's initial offer of $12,000.  While he might prefer to pay even less, it's likely that Alice won't go lower.  He's also close to his target price of $10,000, and accepting the offer will save him $3,750 compared to buying from John."
