"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get a better price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? That's still a great deal for you, and gets me closer to my goal.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. This is still a great deal for me, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
