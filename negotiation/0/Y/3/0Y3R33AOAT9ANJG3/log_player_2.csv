"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our exclusive product, which holds immense value for us. Given its importance and the benefits it offers, we believe it would be worth $10,000 to you. Considering its true worth and your potential benefit, I am extending this opportunity to acquire the product at this special price. Please let me know if you are interested in proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

Since Alice is offering the product for $10,000, which is the maximum Bob is willing to pay, it makes sense to accept the offer.  There's no benefit to rejecting and buying from John at the same price."
