Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a reasonable starting point, considering my minimum value of $15,000.  I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $15,000 meets my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'll counter with a lower price in the next round to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $18,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a profit. I'm hoping Bob will find this price acceptable and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $16,000 is a good compromise and a fair price for the product. I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially end up with a lower price or having to sell to John for $15,000."
