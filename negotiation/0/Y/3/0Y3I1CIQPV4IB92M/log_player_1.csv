"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with it."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum but not too unreasonable. This gives me room to negotiate while still aiming for a good profit. I'm also framing it as a great deal to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $120 is better than selling to John, I still believe I can get closer to my initial asking price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price. How about $135?  This would still be a great deal for you and allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $135 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $130? I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a bit more, $130 is a good price and I'm confident I can still make a profit.  It's better than going down to John's offer and risking a counteroffer from Bob that I might have to accept."
