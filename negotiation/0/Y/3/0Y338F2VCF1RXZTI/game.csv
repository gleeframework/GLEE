"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to let it go for $180. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $180 is a bit too high for me.  Considering your product is worth $150 to you, I'd be willing to pay $120.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll consider selling the product for $160. It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $160 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $140.  This would be a good deal for both of us, considering your value for the product.",140.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $160 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll consider selling the product for $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,5,
