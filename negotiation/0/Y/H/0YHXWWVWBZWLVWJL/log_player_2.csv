"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. This is a great deal, as it's worth much more than that to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can finalize the details. Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Even though Alice's offer is higher than the product's value to you ($8,000), it's still lower than John's price ($10,000). 
* **Saving money is the goal:**  You want to save as much money as possible, and accepting Alice's offer means paying $500 less than you would with John."
