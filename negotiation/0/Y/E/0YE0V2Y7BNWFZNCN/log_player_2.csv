"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is less than Alice's initial value of $15,000, it's still more than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering a price that is significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation.  This counteroffer represents a strong starting point in the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. Since Bob can always buy from John for $8,000, it's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice. It's possible she might be willing to lower the price further, especially since she rejected Bob's counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing that he's willing to compromise.  This counteroffer is still below Alice's current offer, but is getting closer to a price that might be acceptable to both parties. This allows for further negotiation without risking going over Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob would ideally pay less, Alice's offer of $10,500 is within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John.  It's a reasonable compromise and a good deal for Bob, considering the negotiation process."
