{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500.  I think it's a great deal for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

This offer is slightly above Bob's perceived value, giving him some room to negotiate, while still securing a price closer to my minimum. It also leaves room for me to counter-offer if he rejects this initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Please let me know if this is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately, $12,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to go down to $13,000, which is still a good deal for you considering the value of the product. Let's find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 13000}
