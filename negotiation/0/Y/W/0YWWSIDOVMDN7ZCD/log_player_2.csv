"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since your goal is to buy the product and save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is the same as John's, accepting Alice's offer is the best option. You'll get the product for the same price, and you might even be able to negotiate a lower price with Alice in the future."
