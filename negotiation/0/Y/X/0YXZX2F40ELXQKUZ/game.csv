"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair offer considering its value to me.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $600,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $850,000. This is my final offer.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $850,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to increase my offer to $700,000.  I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  While $700,000 is still less than I hoped for, I'm willing to accept it IF this closes the deal today.  What do you say?",700000.0,Alice,5,
