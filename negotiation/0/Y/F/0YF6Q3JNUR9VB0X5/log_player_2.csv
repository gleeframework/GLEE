Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $11,000 is getting closer to his target, he can likely get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows him to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $10,750? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** Bob's maximum budget is $15,000, and Alice's offer is significantly lower.
* **Negotiation Progress:** Alice has already moved closer to Bob's desired price, indicating a willingness to compromise.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While Bob could potentially negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of further rejection is high.  Accepting this offer is a good compromise that saves Bob a substantial amount of money."
