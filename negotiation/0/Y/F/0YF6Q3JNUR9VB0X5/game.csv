"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate the opportunity. However, $12,000 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. Let me know if this is something you're interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,500?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $10,750? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the price.",10750.0,Alice,5,
