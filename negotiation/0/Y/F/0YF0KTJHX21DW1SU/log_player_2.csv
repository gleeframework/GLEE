# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable discount.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $95.  This is a good deal, but you can likely get it for even less. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your interest in the product, I am willing to negotiate further. How about $88 for the product?

Alice is coming down in price, but $88 is still above my desired price point. I'll counter again and see if we can get to $85."

Alice has come down to $86, which is a good price for me. I'd rather not risk her rejecting my counteroffer again, so I'll accept this offer."
