"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair price considering the product's worth to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget right now. Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about we settle at $1,050,000? That's a fair compromise, wouldn't you say?",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you at $1,080,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, so I hope you can consider it seriously.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
