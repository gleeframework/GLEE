# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive start:** Bob wants to quickly establish a lower price point, so he starts with a significant discount from Alice's offer.

Round 3
