"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10000 is unfortunately too low for me. It's a valuable product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $17500? This gives you a good deal, and allows me to cover my costs.  What do you think?",17500.0,Alice,3,
