"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'm trying to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm offering you the product for $10,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price you'll find acceptable.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,250. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",10250.0,Bob,4,
