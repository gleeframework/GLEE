"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $15,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations."", ""product_price"": 15000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes the product's value and uses positive language to create a sense of excitement.  

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor:**  Establish a high starting point for the negotiation.
2. **Gather Information:**  Observe Bob's reaction to understand his willingness to pay. 
3. **Leave Room:** Allow for concessions throughout the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $10,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $10,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal. Selling to John for $12,000 is my safety net, but I believe I can get a higher price from Bob with strategic negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This price reflects the true value and potential this product offers."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:** I've lowered my price by $1,500, a substantial amount that might signal my willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still well above Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price and prevent Bob from anchoring too low.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** I want to guide the negotiation towards a price point closer to my target while leaving room for further adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer and would like to propose $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with the value you're seeking. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,000 matches my minimum acceptable price and what John is willing to pay. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher price in subsequent rounds, the risk of Bob walking away outweighs the potential reward. It's a fair deal, and accepting now guarantees I achieve my goal of selling the product for no less than $12,000."
