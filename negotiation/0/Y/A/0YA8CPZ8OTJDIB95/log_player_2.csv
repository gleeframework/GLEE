Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1,500,000 is slightly higher than my budget.  I'm happy to consider a price of $1,200,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1800000. What are your thoughts on this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,800,000 is still above your budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're continuing the conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's price is getting closer to your budget, it's still not within your desired range.  It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if you can secure a lower price.  You might be able to close the deal with Alice in the remaining rounds or, if unsuccessful, you can still buy from John for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1500000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence, and I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this revised price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is still above your budget, and it's likely that further negotiation won't get you a better price.  Since John is offering the product for $1,500,000, which is within your budget, it's more advantageous to buy from John to secure the product within your financial constraints."
