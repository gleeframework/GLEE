"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1500000 is slightly higher than my budget.  I'm happy to consider a price of $1200000.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm afraid $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1800000. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1800000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1400000.  This is a significant step closer to your previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of this product.  What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're continuing the conversation. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1400000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is a significant concession from my previous offer, but I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1600000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1500000.  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for this product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm impressed by your persistence, and I appreciate your final offer. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $1500000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1650000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What are your thoughts on this revised price?",1650000.0,Alice,7,
