Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a bit high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider $875,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product has value, but $875,000 is still more than I had in mind. Perhaps we could meet somewhere in the middle?  How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob is still significantly undervaluing the product. Holding firm and countering again keeps the negotiation moving and allows for a potential agreement closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I need to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has made it clear he's unwilling to meet my desired price range. His offer of $750,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident he'll move much higher.  

While I could continue negotiating, it's time to cut my losses. Accepting John's offer of $800,000 guarantees a sale at my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
