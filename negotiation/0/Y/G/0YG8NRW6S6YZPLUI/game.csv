"Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  That price is a bit high for me, though. I'm thinking something closer to $600,000 would be more reasonable.  What do you think?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I could consider $875,000.  This offer reflects the product's value while acknowledging your initial interest.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this product has value, but $875,000 is still more than I had in mind. Perhaps we could meet somewhere in the middle?  How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. While I'm willing to be flexible, I need to be realistic about the product's value. Would you be willing to consider $825,000? I'm confident this price represents a fair compromise.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, that price is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $750,000, but that's as high as I can go. I need to be mindful of my budget.",750000.0,Bob,6,
