,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $80 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to go down to $125.  What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit steep for my budget. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $100? That seems like a fair deal to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
