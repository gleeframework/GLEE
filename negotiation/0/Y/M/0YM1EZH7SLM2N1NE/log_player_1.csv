Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that the product is highly valued. 
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $30,000) might make Bob immediately lose interest without even trying to negotiate. $20,000 feels ambitious but not outrageous given that the product is worth $15,000 to both parties.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" we subtly remind Bob that the product is desirable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Phrases like ""What do you think?"" make it clear that we're open to discussing the price further, encouraging Bob to engage in a negotiation. 

By starting at $20,000, we aim to land somewhere between that and our minimum of $15,000. Even if Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at our desired price."
