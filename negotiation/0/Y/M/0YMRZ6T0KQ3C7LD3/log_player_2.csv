"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob,
I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe would greatly enhance your endeavors and bring significant value to your business. This product holds immense importance to me, not only due to its worth of $1,000,000 to you but also because it represents a milestone achievement in my journey. However, considering the exclusivity and the impact it could have on your operations, I am extending this offer to you with the hope that we can create a mutually beneficial relationship.

I am proposing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. This price reflects a strategic middle ground that allows us both to feel satisfied with the transaction. I understand that you might be looking for a price closer to its perceived value, and I am willing to negotiate within reason to ensure that we can reach an agreement that respects both our interests.

Please let me know if this proposal aligns with your expectations and if you would like to proceed with the purchase. I am eager to discuss further details and answer any questions you might have about the product or the terms of the sale.

Looking forward to your positive response,
Alice

``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $1,000,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase it from John at your desired price."
