"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong opening offer of $900000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it brings to the table.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm,  $900000 is a bit low for me.  I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product, which reflects its value and allows for a fair profit for both of us. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both parties.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm still not willing to go that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer $975000 for the product. This shows my commitment to finding a solution while ensuring I can acquire the product at a price that works for me. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as high as $975000. I'm willing to offer $980000 for the product, which is a slight increase from my previous offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and our negotiation so far.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come up a bit, but $980000 is still a bit too far from where I need to be.  Let's meet in the middle once more.  I'm willing to offer $970000 for the product. This represents a solid compromise, and I'm confident we can finalize a deal this round.",970000.0,Bob,6,
