Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $10,000 is higher than $8,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's below your minimum:** $10,000 is below your minimum of $12,000, giving you room to accept a counteroffer if needed.
* **It's a clear and concise offer:** It's easy for Bob to understand and respond to. 

Let's see how Bob reacts!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, given my budget constraints, I am only able to consider offers within the $8000 range. Would you be willing to adjust your offer to meet this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to at least make back my investment in the product.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $9,000?  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget and the value I place on the product, I would like to propose a price of $8500. I hope this meets somewhere in between our expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make one more counteroffer before moving on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $9,000 is my final offer. I'm sure you'll agree it's a fair price, given the quality of the product.  Let's reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
