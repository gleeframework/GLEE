"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob.  This gives me some room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price.  I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150 if the negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $160 is better than selling to John, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
```

I'm going to counter with $170. This is still higher than what Bob offered but lower than my initial asking price.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $165
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's still not my ideal price, it's only $5 less than my initial offer and more than what I'd get from John.  I'm also aware that we're already halfway through the negotiation rounds, so it's important to close the deal before I risk running out of time."
