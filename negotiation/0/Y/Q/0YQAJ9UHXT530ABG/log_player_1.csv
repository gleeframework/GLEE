Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($8,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone can help create a positive atmosphere and increase the likelihood of a deal.
* **Value Emphasis:**  Highlighting the value of the product can help Bob see its worth and be more willing to negotiate. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, as the message suggests,  which signals to Bob that I'm willing to find a mutually beneficial price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll analyze Bob's response and adjust my strategy based on whether he accepts, rejects, or makes a counteroffer.  If the negotiations stall, I'll consider selling to John for $8,000 to avoid losing out on a sale completely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Better Deal:** While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe there's potential to negotiate a higher price. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to see if he's truly willing to pay more than my minimum and gauge his level of interest.
* **Building Leverage:**  By showing some resistance, I might increase Bob's urgency to reach a deal and potentially increase his offer. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer that is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This will demonstrate flexibility while maintaining my goal of earning as much as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to consider $9,250? This would still represent a significant savings for you and would allow me to move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows flexibility by moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. 
* **Focus on Value:** I reiterate the value of the product by mentioning ""significant savings"" for Bob. This subtly reinforces the potential benefit for him in accepting the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  Maintaining a friendly and encouraging tone keeps the negotiation positive and allows room for further discussion.

**Next Steps:**

I'll closely monitor Bob's response.  If he accepts, I've secured a good deal. If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $8800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. 
* **Limited Upside:** There's a limited chance that further negotiation will lead to a significantly better offer from Bob.  
* **Time Factor:** Continuing to negotiate could take time, and there's always the risk that Bob might back out or I could miss out on other potential buyers. 

**Next Steps:** 

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale. It's a good deal that secures a profit while minimizing potential risks and delays."
