Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
