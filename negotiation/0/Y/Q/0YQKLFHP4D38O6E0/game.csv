"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That price is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'm interested in the product, but  $12,000 is not feasible for me. Would you consider a price closer to $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $9,000. This is a compromise that still allows me to make a profit while also being reasonable for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $9,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you be open to $7,500?  That would make it possible for me to move forward today.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",8500.0,Alice,5,
