"I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $90. Can you consider that?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $105 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $95 is still a little below what I'm willing to accept.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $100.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
