Bob's offer:

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm open to negotiation, $500,000 significantly undervalues what this product brings to the table.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I am serious about purchasing it.  However, I have a budget I need to stick to. I can go up to $750,000. That's a significant offer.

You have three options:

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's clear he's anchored firmly below my minimum. Rather than continue haggling and risk getting even closer to $1,000,000, it's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer."
