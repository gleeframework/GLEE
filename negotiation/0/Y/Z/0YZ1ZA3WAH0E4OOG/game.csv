"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid I can't go as low as $5,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming closer to my price range, Alice.  While $9,000 is more reasonable, I'm aiming to spend closer to $6,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your target price is $6,500, but I'm still not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  $8,500 is closer, but I'm still hesitant to go above $7,000. If you're willing to meet me there, I'm ready to close the deal.",7000.0,Bob,6,
