Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable middle ground. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows for both of us to gain something from this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a figure that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,100,000? This is my final offer.

* **Still room for compromise:** You're still within a reasonable range to negotiate a lower price. There's no need to settle yet.
* **Time is on your side:**  You have 5 rounds left, which gives you more leverage to keep pushing for a lower price."
