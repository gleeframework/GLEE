"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its potential value, I'm asking for $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Given my research and the product's current market value, I'd like to offer $950,000. This is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product has the potential to generate substantial returns for you, and I'm confident you'll see a fantastic ROI.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,150,000 is still a bit steep. Let's try to find a mutually agreeable middle ground. How about we settle on $1,050,000? This is a fair price that allows for both of us to gain something from this deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer. While $1,050,000 is closer to the mark, I'm still looking for a figure that reflects the true value of this product. Would you consider $1,100,000? This is my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us. Let's try $1,075,000. This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and our ongoing discussions.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
