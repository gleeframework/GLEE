Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 20000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I begin with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest. 
* **Positive Tone:**  By framing the offer with enthusiasm and emphasizing finding a mutually beneficial deal, I aim to establish a collaborative tone. 
* **Flexibility:** Although I have a backup offer, I want to explore if Bob is willing to pay a price closer to my target before resorting to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $12,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I believe there's room for negotiation. Selling to John for $15,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet. I'll counteroffer to see if I can bridge the gap with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is considerable, and I'm looking for something closer to $18,000. This price reflects the true worth of what I'm offering."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've lowered my price by $2,000, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price without directly dismissing Bob's offer.
* **Strategic Positioning:** I'm aiming for a price above the midpoint between his offer ($12,000) and my initial ask ($20,000). This keeps me in a strong position while encouraging further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $15,000 for the product. I think this is a fair compromise considering the value I can get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. While I might be able to push for a slightly higher amount, the difference is likely to be small. Accepting this offer guarantees a good return without the risk of further negotiation or Bob walking away."
