"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** $110 is less than $120.
* **The product is worth more to Bob than Alice:** Bob values the product at $120, and Alice values it at $80. This means Bob is willing to pay more, so it's in his interest to accept the offer if it's within his budget."
