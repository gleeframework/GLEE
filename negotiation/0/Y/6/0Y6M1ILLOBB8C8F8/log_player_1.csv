Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it leaves room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable price.  It will give me a good sense of Bob's interest level and how much he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $150 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. I'll see if I can get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm counteroffering at $175. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate but still seeking a price closer to my initial offer.  It leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $160. While it's not as much as I initially hoped for, it's still a good deal and above my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the sale altogether, and I'm confident that I can find a better deal in the future."
