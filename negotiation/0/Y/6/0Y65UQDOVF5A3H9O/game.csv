,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to sell. However, $150 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to offer $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer it to you for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $130 is still a bit more than I can comfortably pay.  I'm willing to offer $115.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us, considering the product's value to me. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit below your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. I'll offer you the product for $125. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $122. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits us both. Let me know what you think.",122.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $122 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $122.50. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",122.5,Alice,7,
