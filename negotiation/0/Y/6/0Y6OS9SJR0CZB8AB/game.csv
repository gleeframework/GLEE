"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Could we settle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need a price that reflects the true value of this product. $9,000 is still quite low.  Would you be willing to do $10,500? That's my final offer.",10500.0,Alice,5,
