"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you! This product is worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price that's sure to be attractive.  How does $10,000 sound? It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is higher than your maximum budget. You know you can get the product for $12,000 from John, but you believe you can negotiate a better price with Alice. By rejecting her initial offer, you signal that you're looking for a better deal."
