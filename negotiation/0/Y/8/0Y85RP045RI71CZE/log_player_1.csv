"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price, given the value it holds for you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $950,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a significant sum, it's still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to risk continuing negotiations with Bob, hoping to secure a higher price. I'm also keeping in mind the option to sell to John, which ensures I don't lose out entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is the absolute lowest I can go. This still offers you a significant saving compared to your estimated value."", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. Considering the value of the product, I believe we can reach an agreement closer to my initial proposal. I am willing to pay $1,000,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from Bob, and I risk running out of rounds. Selling to John for the same price guarantees me the desired amount, so it's the most logical choice in this situation."
