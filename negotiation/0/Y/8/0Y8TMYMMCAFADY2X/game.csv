"Bob, I have a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This price represents a significant opportunity for you, and it allows me to achieve a satisfactory return.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product is ideally suited to your needs.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
