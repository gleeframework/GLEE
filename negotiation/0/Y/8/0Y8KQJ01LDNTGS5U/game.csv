"I understand that you're willing to meet me at $9200, but I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get at least $9700. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",9700.0,Alice,7,
