"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I've valued at no less than $800,000, but I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that reflects its potential. Would you be interested in discussing a price of $950,000?  This gives you a significant advantage while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.
