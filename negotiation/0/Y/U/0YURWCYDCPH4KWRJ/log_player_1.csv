Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This is a unique chance to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you start with a price significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a much higher profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""value and potential"" of the product, subtly justifying the high price without revealing your minimum. 
* **Exclusivity:** By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of urgency and desirability.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer.  Be prepared to:

* **Negotiate:** Bob might counter-offer. Be ready to haggle but stay firm on a price that's significantly above your $1,200,000 minimum.
* **Walk away if necessary:** If Bob remains unwilling to meet a price acceptable to you, remember you have John as a guaranteed buyer."
