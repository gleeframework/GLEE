"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm framing the offer in a positive and persuasive way, highlighting the value to Bob.
* **Room for Compromise:** The offer leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer, ensuring the negotiation continues. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while keeping the negotiation open and allowing me to gauge Bob's willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $9,000 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd prefer to earn.
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I can likely secure a higher price with further rounds.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 is a tempting option, but it eliminates any chance of a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, aiming to find a middle ground. 
* **Remaining Rounds:**  I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, leveraging the remaining rounds to secure the best possible price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fantastic price for the value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by reducing my initial price, showing my willingness to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm providing a reason for the counteroffer, emphasizing the product's value to reinforce my position.
* **Open-Ended Question:** I'm leaving the door open for further discussion and a potential compromise.

This approach allows me to further explore the possibilities of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement while maintaining my goal of earning a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose $10,000 as a potential price. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While $10,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee a much higher profit. However, I'm still optimistic that I can get closer to that price with Bob.
* **Remaining Rounds:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground. I will also reiterate the product's value and my willingness to negotiate further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $10,500. This would allow us both to find common ground. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering my price again, signaling my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product to justify my counteroffer and maintain my position.
* **Clear Next Step:**  I'm making a concrete proposal for the next round, pushing Bob to respond with a decision.

**Strategy:**

This approach balances my desire for a higher price with the need to maintain the negotiation and potentially reach an agreement.  I'm using each round to gradually decrease my offer while still highlighting the value of the product, hoping to reach a point where Bob accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. I would like to propose $10,200 as a fair price for the product. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the item I need. I hope we can reach an agreement that satisfies both of us.

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still slightly lower than what I believe the product is worth.
* **John's Offer:** Selling to John for $15,000 would guarantee a much higher profit, and with only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to make a decision. However, I'm still optimistic that I can get closer to that price with Bob.
* **Remaining Rounds:** With 4 rounds remaining, I have time to explore if I can get a better deal with Bob. I believe there's still room for negotiation, especially since Bob's offers have been increasing.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** In the next round, I will counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming to find a middle ground. I will also reiterate the product's value and my willingness to negotiate further.  

I will try to push Bob to make a final decision, considering that time is running out and John is a very tempting option."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,350?  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen before we run out of time."", ""product_price"": 10350}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** I'm highlighting the limited time remaining to encourage Bob to make a decision.
* **Splitting the difference:**  I'm offering a compromise that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, creating a sense of urgency and a final opportunity for agreement.
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language like ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of momentum and encourage Bob to agree.

**Strategy:**

With only three rounds remaining, I'm putting more pressure on Bob to accept a price closer to my desired value. This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while emphasizing the urgency of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your proposal, but I must stick to my budget. I would like to propose $10,250 as a reasonable price for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:**  With only two rounds remaining, there's very little room for further negotiation.
* **Small Difference:**  The difference between Bob's offer and my desired price is minimal. While I could counteroffer again, it's unlikely to yield a significant increase.
* **John's Offer:**  Selling to John for $15,000 is a significantly better deal, guaranteeing a much higher profit.

**Decision:**

Even though I'm close to a deal with Bob, the time constraint and John's offer make it more beneficial to sell to John. This decision maximizes my profit and ensures I don't miss out on a guaranteed higher price."
