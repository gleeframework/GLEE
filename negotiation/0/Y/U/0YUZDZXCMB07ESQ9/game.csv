,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a fantastic price for the value this product offers. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I understand the value of the product, but I would like to propose $10,000 as a potential price. This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $10,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $10,500. This would allow us both to find common ground. I believe this price reflects the true value of the product.",10500.0,Alice,5,

,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close!  I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,350?  This is a fair price that reflects both our needs.  Let's make this deal happen before we run out of time.",10350.0,Alice,7,
