"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While I am happy to receive an offer of $15,000, it is still below my minimum desired value. I will reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a higher price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is above my minimum desired value of $15,000. I'm willing to accept this offer, as it's a good price and I don't want to risk further negotiation potentially lowering the price."
