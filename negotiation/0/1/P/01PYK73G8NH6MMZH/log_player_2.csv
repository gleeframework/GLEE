"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity to sell this product to you, and I'm excited to share it with you. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and a counteroffer could potentially lead to a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to pay closer to $9,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to get a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $10000 for the product. Can we discuss further? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still better than John's price:** $10,000 is significantly cheaper than $15,000.
* **There's not much more room for negotiation:** Alice is already willing to meet halfway, and further counteroffers could risk her walking away from the deal entirely.  
* **The product is worth $15,000 to Bob:**  Accepting this offer ensures a good deal for Bob, even if it's not the absolute lowest price."
