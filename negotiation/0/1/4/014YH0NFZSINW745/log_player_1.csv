Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for potential negotiation and makes it more likely you'll land closer to your desired profit margin. 
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will be telling. If he accepts, great! If he negotiates, it indicates he's interested but wants a better deal.  
* **Backup Plan:**  Remember, John offers a safety net at $8,000. This allows Alice to be more assertive in her negotiation with Bob."
