Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000,  a price that reflects its true worth."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Our goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible, knowing we have John as a guaranteed buyer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation downward if Bob counters.
* **Balance with Bob's Valuation:** While $950,000 is significantly higher than Bob's $800,000 valuation,  it's still a substantial discount compared to John's offer. There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a premium to secure the product, especially if it's scarce or time-sensitive. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes we have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how urgently he needs the product. Gathering more information about Bob could potentially lead to a more tailored and effective offer."
