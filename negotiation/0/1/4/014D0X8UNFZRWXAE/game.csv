"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a great price for you considering the potential. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,500,000 is closer to the true value of this product.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is a fair offer that reflects the product's worth. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is still above my budget. I'm prepared to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Bob,4,
