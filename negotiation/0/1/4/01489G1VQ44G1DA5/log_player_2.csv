"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $13,000 is better than $15,000, there is still room for negotiation. Bob has a strong incentive to try and get a lower price, knowing that he has a backup option with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. $11,000 is still a good deal for Bob (better than John's price), while leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer shows that Bob is serious about getting a good price, but is also willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $12,000. This is a good deal for Bob, as it's lower than his fallback price with John ($15,000). There is a chance that Bob might be able to get an even better price, but the risk of Alice rejecting another offer is higher. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a price that is beneficial to him."
