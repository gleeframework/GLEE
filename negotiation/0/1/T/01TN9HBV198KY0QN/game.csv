"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm offering it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal considering its value, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering me.  $10,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend right now.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but how about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  This would still be a good deal for you, and it would allow me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my budget. How about $9,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal.",9250.0,Bob,4,
