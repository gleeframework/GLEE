"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. Given its immense potential and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin with a strong offer closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) than our minimum ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a highly profitable outcome. 
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to justify the high price, hoping to anchor Bob's perception. 
* **Alternative:**  We keep the ""John"" option ($800,000) as a fallback if negotiations fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than our initial ask and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table. We have room to negotiate, and we're confident we can get closer to our desired outcome in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and make a significant concession ($100,000), but we reinforce that the product is worth more.
* **Middle Ground:**  Proposing $1,200,000 aims for a price point that's a win-win, still leaving us with a substantial profit.
* **Time Consideration:**  We have seven rounds left, giving us space to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,200,000 is closer, but still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to do $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is moving closer to our range, but $100,000 is still a significant difference. We'll hold firm for now to gauge his willingness to move further up. We'll make a smaller concession in the next round to signal we're getting closer to a deal point, while still aiming higher than his current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen â€“ how about $1,150,000? I think that's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:** We're reducing our counteroffer by $50,000, signaling we're nearing our acceptable range.
* **Urgency and Encouragement:**  The language emphasizes getting the deal done and highlights the mutually beneficial aspect.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This counteroffer puts us in a good position to either accept a counteroffer around $1,125,000 or stand firm at $1,150,000, still well above our minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down further.  I'm getting close to my limit, but how about we settle at $1,120,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  Bob's offer of $1,120,000 represents a significant profit margin ($320,000 above our minimum). 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could try to push for more in the remaining rounds, Bob has indicated he's near his limit.  Continuing carries the risk of him walking away. 
* **Time Value:** Closing the deal now secures a very favorable price without the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
