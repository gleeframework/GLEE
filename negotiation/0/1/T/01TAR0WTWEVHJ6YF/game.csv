"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it allows us both to make a profit. Let's close this deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate a good price, but $920,000 still falls short of what I need. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think.",935000.0,Alice,5,
