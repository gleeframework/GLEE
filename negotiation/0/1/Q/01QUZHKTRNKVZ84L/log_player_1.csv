""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as much as possible from the sale. 
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $12,000, giving us room to negotiate above Alice's minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John ($8,000), so she doesn't have to go below that.

By offering the product at $10,000, Alice aims for a price that:

* **Is appealing to Bob:** He gets a $2,000 discount from his perceived value.
* **Earns Alice a significant profit:** $2,000 more than her minimum acceptable price."
