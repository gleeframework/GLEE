"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, we believe it's worth more than $120. Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose a fair price of $140 to ensure both parties benefit. This offer allows us to recoup a reasonable profit while providing you with a valuable item at a price slightly below its perceived value to you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you.",140.0,Alice,1,
