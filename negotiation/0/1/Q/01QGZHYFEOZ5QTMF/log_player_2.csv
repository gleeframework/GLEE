"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its exceptional quality and value, we believe it's worth more than $120. Considering its worth to you is $150, I propose a fair price of $140 to ensure both parties benefit. This offer allows us to recoup a reasonable profit while providing you with a valuable item at a price slightly below its perceived value to you. Please let me know if this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $140 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. By rejecting this offer, you open the possibility of Alice proposing a lower price, getting you closer to your $150 maximum."
