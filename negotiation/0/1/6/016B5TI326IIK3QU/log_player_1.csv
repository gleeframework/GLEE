"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing that Bob might counteroffer.  This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, but also maximizes my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $1,200,000. I'm going to try and get closer to my target price by sending Bob a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still staying above my minimum value of $1,200,000.  This shows Bob I'm serious about negotiating, while also maintaining a good profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm accepting Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Value of the product:** I'm getting closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000. 
* **Time constraints:** We're only in Round 4, so there's plenty of time left to negotiate if I reject this offer and make a counteroffer. However, there's no guarantee that Bob will keep going. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a risk that Bob will walk away if I reject, and I might end up having to sell to John for less. 

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer secures a decent profit and avoids the potential risk of getting a worse deal later on."
