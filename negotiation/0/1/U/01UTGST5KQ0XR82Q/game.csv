"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  While I'm interested, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'd be happy to consider a price of $1,000,000.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $1,000,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $1,300,000. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm comfortable going up to $1,100,000.  Let's split the difference and see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're making progress, Bob! However, $1,100,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm counteroffering at $1,200,000. I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
