Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $1,300,000 is closer to his budget, he can likely get a better price.  It's worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."

I'm confident that this price reflects the product's value, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.
