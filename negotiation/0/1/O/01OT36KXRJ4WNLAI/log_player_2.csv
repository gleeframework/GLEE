"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a special offer. I'm offering the product to you for $11,000. This is a one-time deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Reasoning: 

* Alice's offer of $11,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $12,000.
* While you could buy from John for $12,000, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000."
