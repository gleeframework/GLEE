"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of significant value to you. It's worth at least $1,200,000 to you, and I'm offering it to you at a price that's fair to both of us. Let's discuss a price that works for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly starting the negotiation high. While her product might be worth $1,200,000 to me, I know I have John as a backup option. By rejecting her initial offer, I might be able to get her to come down to a more reasonable price."
