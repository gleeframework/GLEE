Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. How about we try $750,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Explanation: While Bob is moving closer to a more reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $800,000 mark I need.  It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
