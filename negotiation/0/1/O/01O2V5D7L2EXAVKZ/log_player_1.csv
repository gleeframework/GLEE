Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $15,000 to me, I'll make an offer that's slightly higher than that to test the waters. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 20,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's counteroffer is $18,000, which is lower than my initial offer of $20,000. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer that's higher than $18,000.

I'll make a counteroffer of $19,500, which is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob's offer is now $17,500, which is lower than my previous counteroffer of $19,500. Since I'm still trying to maximize my earnings, I'll reject Bob's offer and make another counteroffer that's higher than $17,500.

I'll make a new counteroffer of $18,750, which is a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's latest offer. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me at $18,750!
