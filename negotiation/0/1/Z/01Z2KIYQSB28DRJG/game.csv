"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with an offer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this price is fair considering the value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $900,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000. This price reflects the value of the product for both of us, and I believe it's a fair deal.  What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not ready to accept $875,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $885,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. Let me know what you think.",885000.0,Alice,5,
