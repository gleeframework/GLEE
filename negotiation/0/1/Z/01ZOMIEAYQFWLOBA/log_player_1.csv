Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth at least $150. Would you be interested in buying it for that price?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Adding Value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to make it more appealing.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message makes it clear I'm open to negotiation, giving Bob the opportunity to make a counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential profit while also being open to a fair deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a price closer to my initial asking price, potentially securing a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but presenting a new price point.
* **Compromise:**  The counteroffer is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's price but still above my minimum. 
* **Staying Firm:**  The message reiterates my value for the product, hinting at my unwillingness to go much lower."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. How about $125? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go up to $135. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $125 is a good compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $100, and it's close enough to my desired price range that I'm willing to accept it to avoid further negotiation."
