"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm willing to negotiate further to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,500 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to find a solution that works for both of us.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8,750. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is still too low for me, but I'm starting to feel the pressure. I need to keep negotiating to try and get a better price, but I'm also aware that I might have to settle for less than my ideal price. I'm going to make another counteroffer, but I'm also starting to consider selling to John if I don't get a satisfactory offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still not enough for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $8,900. This is a fair price for both of us. I'm confident that you'll find this product to be extremely valuable, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8900}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $8,800, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While I'm still disappointed that I'm not getting my desired price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my acceptable range. I've already rejected a few offers, and I'm running out of rounds. Accepting his offer of $8,800 ensures a sale and minimizes the risk of losing the deal altogether.  I can still make a decent profit, and it's worth it to secure the deal."
