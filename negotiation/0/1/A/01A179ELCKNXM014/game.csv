"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit too much for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I place on it and the fact that I'm ready to purchase now.",9000.0,Bob,4,
