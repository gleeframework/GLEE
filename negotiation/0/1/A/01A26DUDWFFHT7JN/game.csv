"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the value. However, I'm looking for a price closer to $9,000.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $8,750?",8750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit higher than $8,750. Would you be willing to consider $8,250? I think that's a more reasonable price for me.",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate that you're serious about buying and I want to find a price we can both agree on.  However, $8,250 is cutting it a little too close.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $8,375? I think that's a reasonable compromise.",8375.0,Bob,6,
