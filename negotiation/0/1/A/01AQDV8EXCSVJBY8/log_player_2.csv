**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,050,000, which is the midpoint between her starting price and your initial counteroffer.  While you could try to push for a lower price, it's getting riskier.  Alice might be less willing to negotiate further, and you'd be losing potential savings. It's a good deal compared to John's offer."
