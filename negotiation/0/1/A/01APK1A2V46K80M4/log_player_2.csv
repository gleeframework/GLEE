"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is offering it for $1,100,000. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting point:**  A counteroffer of $950,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer.  It shows you're serious about buying but also that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Leaving room:** This counteroffer leaves room for negotiation, as you're still willing to pay above Alice's value of $800,000.
* **Focus on value:** Highlighting the product's value to you emphasizes the benefit of the deal for Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the gap between $950,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,025,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable paying. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a price closer to my desired range. Rejecting this offer allows me to make another counteroffer and try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer:** This counteroffer moves closer to Alice's last offer, showing you're serious about getting a deal done.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  It still leaves a little space for Alice to compromise if she's willing to come down a bit more.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:**  The message emphasizes the compromise and the fair price for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? This offer reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your interest. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,000,000, which is still above my target price but within my acceptable range.  Accepting this offer means I get the product for a price lower than John's offer and avoids further negotiation rounds.  The risk of continuing and potentially failing to reach an agreement with Alice is higher than accepting this offer."
