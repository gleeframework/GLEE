"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the potential savings it offers.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but the gap between $950,000 and my initial ask reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle at $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $975,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product to both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. To show my commitment to reaching a deal, I'm willing to come down slightly. How about $1,000,000 even? This offer reflects the product's significant value while recognizing your interest.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
