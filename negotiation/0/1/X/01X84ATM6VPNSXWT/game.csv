"Hi Alice, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great deal for a product worth at least $100 to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",95.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,4,
