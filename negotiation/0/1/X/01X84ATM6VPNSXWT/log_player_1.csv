Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal for something worth at least $100 to me. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but still within a range where negotiation is possible. 
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm highlighting the product's worth to me, creating a sense of value for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message is friendly and open to discussion, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

By starting high and expressing willingness to negotiate, I aim to:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** I want to get as close to my desired price as possible.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:** His response will reveal how seriously he's considering the purchase. 
* **Control the Negotiation:** By starting strong, I establish a framework for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation to reach a price closer to my target.
* **John as Backup:** Having John as an alternative buyer at $100 gives me leverage in the negotiation. 

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that satisfies both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $95.  That's still a great deal for a product worth at least $100 to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by dropping my price from $120 to $95.
* **Emphasize Value:** I'm reiterating the product's worth to me, aiming to solidify its value in Bob's mind.
* **Positive Negotiation:**  My message maintains a friendly tone, emphasizing collaboration and finding a ""middle ground.""

**Strategy:**

By offering a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's initial proposal but still above my minimum, I aim to:

* **Signal Flexibility:**  I'm showing that I'm open to negotiation.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  I'm not conceding too much, ensuring I still have some room to bargain.
* **Increase Chances of Agreement:**  The $95 offer is a reasonable compromise that may entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90. If you're willing to meet me there, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'm going to have to go with John's offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  If I reject this offer, there's a high chance Bob will walk away and I might not get a better deal. 
* **Guaranteed Profit:**  John offers a guaranteed $100, which is a safer option and aligns with my initial goal of maximizing profit.

**Strategy:**

Given the proximity of Bob's offer to my minimum and the risk involved in further negotiation, selling to John at $100 is the most sensible choice.  This secures a guaranteed profit and avoids the potential of getting stuck with a lower price."
