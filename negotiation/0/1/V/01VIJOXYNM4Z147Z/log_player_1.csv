Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth a significant amount to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, I need to aim for a price higher than that with Bob to maximize profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $950,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It signals that the product is valuable while still being potentially appealing to him.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, hopefully swaying him towards accepting the offer. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while ensuring a profitable sale regardless of his decision."
