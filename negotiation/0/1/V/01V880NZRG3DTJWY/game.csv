"Alice, that's a bit high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to offer you $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can work something out.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10000 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $17500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's get this deal done!",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $17500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer you $14000 for the product.  What do you say?",14000.0,Bob,4,
