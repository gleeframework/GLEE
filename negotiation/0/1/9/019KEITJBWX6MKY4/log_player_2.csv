It's too expensive. Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}

I'm willing to pay $12,000.  That's a significant discount from her initial offer, and still leaves some room for negotiation."

$17,000 is still too high. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm going to stick with my strategy of slowly chipping away at the price. $14,000 is a fair compromise, and hopefully Alice will be ready to meet me in the middle."

We're getting closer, but I'm still not comfortable paying that much. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."

I'm willing to go up to $15,000, but that's my final offer. If Alice doesn't accept, I'll go with John."
