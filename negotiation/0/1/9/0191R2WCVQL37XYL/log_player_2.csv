Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4

{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. How about we split the difference and settle at $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

At this point, Alice is signaling she's firm on her price.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and risking going over $105 to save a few dollars isn't worth potentially losing the deal."
