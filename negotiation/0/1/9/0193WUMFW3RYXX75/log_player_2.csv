"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $14,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice first.  $14,000 is too close to our maximum budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much room there is for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product offers significant value, and I believe $13,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down $1,000, so there's room for negotiation. We're still aiming to get closer to $12,000. Let's see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand its value, Alice, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we meet in the middle at $11,500?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

We're splitting the difference between her last offer and our previous one. This shows we're willing to negotiate, but we're also standing our ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. How about we settle this right now at $12,500? It's a fantastic deal for a product you won't be disappointed with. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to her value, but we're still within our budget and have room to negotiate. We'll try one more time to get closer to $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""It's a tempting offer, Alice.  How about $12,100? That's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 12100
}
``` 

We're pushing a bit closer to her known value while making it clear this is our final offer.  This puts the ball in her court and avoids unnecessary back-and-forth."
