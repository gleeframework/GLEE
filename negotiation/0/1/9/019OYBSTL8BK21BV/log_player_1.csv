Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $9,500 is significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's a $500 buffer between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some back-and-forth. 
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Offering a price much closer to Bob's perceived value might make him immediately accept, leaving you with less potential profit. 

By starting with this offer, you can assess Bob's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm offering $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,700 is only $300 less than my initial offer. This is a good deal for me, considering the possibility that he might reject my next counteroffer, leaving me to sell to John for $8,000.  It's worth accepting his offer to secure the deal and avoid further negotiation."
