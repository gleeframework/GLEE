"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits it will bring to your business.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  To move this forward, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000.  This feels like a fair compromise.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $1,700,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $1,150,000? I feel this is a fair offer that reflects the product's value while working within my financial constraints.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Let's settle this at $1,450,000. This is my final offer.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
