Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product has value,  $2,000,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
