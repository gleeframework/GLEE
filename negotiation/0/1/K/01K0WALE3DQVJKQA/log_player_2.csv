"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your maximum budget. It's much better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to lower her price, especially since you're willing to buy from John for a significantly lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 to John, it makes sense to start the negotiation by offering Alice that same amount. This establishes my maximum budget and leaves room for potential compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,500,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my ideal price. I'm willing to pay John $1,000,000, so it makes sense to continue negotiating with Alice. There's still room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and willingness to compromise. However, I'm still keeping it below Alice's last offer, aiming to find a middle ground.  $1,250,000 represents a good compromise between my budget and Alice's previous offer, and hopefully, she'll accept it."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to my maximum, but it's still too high for my comfort level.  I've already gone back and forth with Alice multiple times and it seems like she's not willing to budge much further. Given that John is offering the product for a price I'm comfortable with, it's best to cut my losses and buy from John."
