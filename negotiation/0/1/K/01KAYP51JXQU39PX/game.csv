"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $850,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
