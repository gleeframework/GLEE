"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit too high. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. It's clear this product holds significant value for both of us. While I'm aiming a bit higher, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. I believe this reflects a fair compromise given its potential.  What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit far from the $1,350,000, and I'd like to try to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need a bit more flexibility. I'll propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000, but if you're willing to sell it to me for $1,250,000, I'll accept it immediately. Let me know if this is something you're open to.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
