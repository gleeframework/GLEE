"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a profit well above my minimum of $800,000.  Bob has a clear incentive to negotiate, as he values the product at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I can do better than $900,000, as I value the product at $800,000. I'll counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,000,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing my willingness to compromise.  It's also a price that is still considerably above my minimum value, allowing me to secure a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $950,000 is getting closer to my ideal.  It's a good compromise, and I'm comfortable accepting it."
