"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to acquire a truly unique asset. I'm willing to start the conversation with an initial offer of $1200000. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement closer to $1000000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000? ",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to make a deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. Considering the product's value and the market demand, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My revised offer is $1175000. This is the best I can do, and I believe it's a fair price for both parties. What are your thoughts?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1175000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway on our last offers, bringing the price to $1112500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product while ensuring you receive a reasonable return on your investment.",1112500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that we're close, Bob, but I'm not ready to meet you at $1112500. Considering the product's value and the negotiations so far, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll meet you at $1150000, but that's as low as I can go. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1150000.0,Alice,5,
