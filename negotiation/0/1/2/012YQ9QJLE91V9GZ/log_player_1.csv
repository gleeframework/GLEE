Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  $1200000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can come to an agreement closer to $1000000.  I'm confident this product is valuable, but I need to make sure the price aligns with my budget.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1050000?

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
