Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $20,000 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  It's always best to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Justifying the price:**  Mentioning the product's uniqueness gives Bob a reason to consider the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message makes it clear that you're willing to discuss the price, avoiding a hard ""take it or leave it"" approach.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects, we'll need to analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new offer. 
* **John's option:**  We need to keep John in mind as a backup buyer if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is your minimum:** Bob is offering your minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **No room for improvement:** There's no benefit to rejecting Bob's offer and risking further negotiation. 
* **John is a fallback:** While John offers the same price, there's no guarantee he'll still be interested if you reject Bob.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer secures your minimum desired price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
