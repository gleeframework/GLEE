Since you're trying to save as much money as possible, and the product is only worth $150 to you, it makes sense to reject Alice's initial offer of $160. You can then try to negotiate a lower price."

You've been negotiating, but Alice is still offering a price above your maximum.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John at $150, it's time to take that deal and avoid further negotiation."
