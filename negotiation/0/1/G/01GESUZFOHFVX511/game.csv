"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to pay $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair compromise and would like to hear your thoughts on it.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the value, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? This would still be a significant saving for you.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I'm still looking to save as much as I can. Considering your initial offer was $1,150,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
