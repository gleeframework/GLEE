"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,000? I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $6,000. Considering its value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, taking into account the value you place on the product and my own minimum requirements.",8500.0,Alice,3,
