Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,500. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:** $13,500 is still within Bob's range of what he's willing to pay, making it more likely he'll consider the offer.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This leaves room for negotiation and ensures you don't sell too low.
* **It's a strong starting point:**  By starting at a price higher than your minimum, you create room to negotiate down if necessary.

Keep in mind, this is just a starting point. Depending on how Bob responds, you'll need to adjust your strategy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're offering, my budget for this product is a bit lower. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum. I will reject his offer and try to get a better price."
