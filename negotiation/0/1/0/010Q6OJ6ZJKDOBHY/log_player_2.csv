"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's worth $100 to you, and I believe we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. Let me start by suggesting a price of $95 for the product. I look forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  You value the product at $100, and Alice is offering it for $95. This means you're losing $5 on the deal.
* **Negotiation is possible:** You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and negotiate a better price. 
* **John's price is a safety net:** If negotiations fail, you can still purchase the product from John for $100, which is your maximum value. 

By rejecting the initial offer, you can start the negotiation process and aim for a price closer to your ideal value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer within your range:** $85 is still within your acceptable price range (up to $100) and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Showing willingness to compromise:** Offering $85 demonstrates that you're serious about buying the product but also that you're not willing to accept Alice's initial offer.
* **Keeping John in mind:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $100, so you have a backup plan if this negotiation doesn't work out."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position, and I'd like to find a middle ground. How about we agree on a price of $90 for the product? This is still a fair price considering its value to you, while also allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's closer to your ideal price, $90 is still above what you're willing to pay. You value the product at $100, and you've already stated your willingness to pay $85. 
* **More room for negotiation:**  You have several rounds remaining, and there's still a chance Alice might be willing to come down further.
* **John is still a backup:** If negotiations fail, you can buy from John for $100.

By rejecting this offer, you can continue to negotiate and try to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $90 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $87.50 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Alice's offer:**  You're increasing your offer to $87.50, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While you're getting closer to Alice's price, you're still leaving room for her to come down a bit more.
* **Maintaining a reasonable price:** You're still staying within your acceptable price range and avoiding a deal that's significantly unfavorable to you.

This counteroffer shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but you're also committed to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $89 for the product. It's a slight increase from your last offer, but still below its perceived value to you. I hope this helps us reach a satisfactory agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $89. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $89
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to your ideal price:** $89 is very close to your ideal price of $85, and it's a significant improvement from Alice's previous offers.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** You have only 5 rounds left, and there's a risk that you might not be able to get a lower price in the remaining time.
* **John's offer as a safety net:** Even though you're accepting this offer, John's offer of $100 provides a backup option if things go wrong.

While you might be able to negotiate a slightly lower price, the risk of losing out on the product altogether due to limited rounds outweighs the potential benefit of a smaller discount. Accepting Alice's offer at $89 secures the product at a reasonable price and leaves you with a positive outcome."
