,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and what similar products are selling for in the market. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still not convinced that $825000 is a fair price. I'm willing to go up to $750000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me in the middle?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $850000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the product's value and the market demand. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to think that this product is not worth as much as you're making it out to be. I'm willing to go up to $775000, but that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",775000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $775000. I'm willing to make one final concession, and I'll meet you at $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm not willing to pay $825000, and I think you're not willing to go any lower. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'll only do it if you're willing to throw in some extras or provide some additional value. If not, I'll have to consider other options.",812500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a premium support package, which is valued at $20000. Considering this additional value, I'm willing to meet you at $825000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to pay $825000. I'm willing to meet you at $800000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to consider buying from John for $1500000.",800000.0,Bob,10,
