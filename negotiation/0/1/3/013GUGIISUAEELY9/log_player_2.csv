"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$500,000 is a very good price, but we don't know the value of the product to Alice. It's worth exploring if we can get it for even less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a very low counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal. I'm assuming that Alice is willing to negotiate and this counteroffer is likely to be rejected, but it gives me an opportunity to start the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $400,000 is still a good price, it's worth seeing if we can push for a lower price. We have 7 rounds left, and Alice has already shown some willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing that I'm willing to negotiate, but still trying to get a good deal. I'm aiming for a price that's closer to the middle ground between my previous offer and Alice's last offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down considerably in price, and we're getting closer to a deal.  While we could continue to negotiate, $350,000 is a good price, and we have a chance to potentially get an even better deal in the next round.  It's a good balance of risk and reward."
