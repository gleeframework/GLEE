"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value and our previous discussions. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
