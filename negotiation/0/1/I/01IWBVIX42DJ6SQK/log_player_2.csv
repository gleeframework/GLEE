"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $150. It makes more sense to reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested, but how about we start with $110? "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $110 is a bit low for me, how about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $130 is closer to your desired price, you can likely still negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I'm still interested, but $130 is still a bit high.  How about we split the difference and go with $125?"", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
