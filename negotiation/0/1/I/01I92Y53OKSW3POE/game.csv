"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a fair price considering the product's value. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $1,200,000 is a fair price. Can you consider that?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
