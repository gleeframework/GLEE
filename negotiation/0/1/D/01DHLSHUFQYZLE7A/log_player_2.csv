# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that you're interested in. I'm willing to offer it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Alice's offer of $130 is lower than her value, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. Rejecting this offer gives you the opportunity to buy at your desired price point."
