Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this unique product. I know its value is significant to you, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a substantial profit above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:**  Alice has John as a backup buyer at $1,000,000, so she can afford to be a bit bolder in her initial offer to Bob.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just one possible offer. Alice could choose to be more aggressive (starting closer to $1,200,000) or more conservative (starting closer to $1,100,000). 
* The message is friendly and professional, emphasizing a ""win-win"" outcome. 
* It doesn't reveal Alice's minimum price or the existence of John."
