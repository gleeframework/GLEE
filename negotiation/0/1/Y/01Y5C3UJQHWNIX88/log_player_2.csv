"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth more than $1,500,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $2,000,000. This is a bad deal for Bob. It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."

I'm starting with a lowball offer of $1,000,000. It's unlikely Alice will accept this, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and shows Bob is serious about getting a better price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a better price."

Bob is increasing his offer, but it's still lower than Alice's price. This shows he's willing to compromise but also wants to get the best price possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price. However, it's still slightly higher, and it's worth trying to negotiate a bit more. Bob should aim for a price closer to $1,500,000."

Bob is getting close to his limit, but he's still trying to get a better deal.  Offering $1,550,000 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying, but it's still a little lower than Alice's price. It puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,575,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,575,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, but it's still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. It's a tough decision, but at this point, it's more efficient to simply buy the product from John for $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Alice might save some money, but the risk of the negotiation dragging on and potentially causing Bob to miss out on the product altogether outweighs the potential savings."
