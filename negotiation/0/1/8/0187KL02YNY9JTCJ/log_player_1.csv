{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives him incentive to negotiate.
* **Is significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate and still make a good profit.
* **Is a round number:** This makes it easier for Bob to process the offer.

This offer also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work towards a more mutually beneficial price. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if we can reach a more favorable price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'd like to propose $1,300,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the price competitive for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I believe I can get a higher price with further negotiation. I will reject his offer and make a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've carefully considered your last offer. While I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise, I believe we can still find a price that works for both of us.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. While Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still too far below my target. I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially lose out on a better deal. John is a guaranteed buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price."
