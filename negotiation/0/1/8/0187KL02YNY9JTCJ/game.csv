"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I think we can work towards a more mutually beneficial price. How about we aim for $1,200,000? This would allow us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,350,000 is a step in the right direction, I'd like to propose $1,300,000. This still allows for a reasonable profit for you while keeping the price competitive for me.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, and I respect that. However, $1,300,000 is still a little too low for me.  Let's aim for a price that benefits us both. I'm willing to offer the product for $1,375,000. This is a reasonable compromise, and it brings us closer to a deal.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
