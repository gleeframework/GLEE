"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to my price, I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to my initial offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,4,
