Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to value:** I'm emphasizing the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussing the price further, but I'm not giving away the farm.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! I've secured a sale above my minimum.
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, counter, or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer to my minimum than his initial perceived value, it's still not enough for me to consider selling.
* **I have a backup option.**  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is a guaranteed win, so I'm not desperate to close a deal with Bob at a subpar price.
* **Negotiation leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counter with a higher price and potentially push him closer to my target. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll send Bob a counteroffer, aiming to close the gap between his offer and my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $900,000 is closer to my price, I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this deal work.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This would still be a significant saving for you compared to my initial offer."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving towards a compromise:** My counteroffer is higher than Bob's, but it's a significant decrease from my initial offer. This shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm emphasizing the ""significant saving"" Bob would get compared to my first offer. This plays on the idea of a good deal for him.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  The offer of $1,050,000 is a compromise between my minimum price and Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've achieved a decent sale price.
* If Bob rejects, I'll need to consider if I want to counter again or sell to John.  If I counter, I'll need to carefully weigh whether I want to lower my price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.**  While $950,000 is closer, it's still not enough for me to accept.
* **I have a guaranteed better option.**  John is offering me $1,500,000, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  Selling to John is the safest and most lucrative option at this point.

**Next Steps:**

I'm going to sell to John and secure a sale that meets my minimum price and exceeds my expectations."
