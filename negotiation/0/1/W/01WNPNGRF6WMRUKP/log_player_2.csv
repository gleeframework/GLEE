"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $850,000. This is a fantastic deal, as you know the product is worth at least $800,000 to you. I'm confident you'll see the value in this offer. Let me know your decision, as I have another interested buyer ready to purchase it for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is close to Bob's valuation, it's still higher than what he'd pay John. Rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John for $800,000 saves Bob $50,000."
