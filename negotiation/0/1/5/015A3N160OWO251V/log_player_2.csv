"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its high value and quality, we believe it's worth $80 to you. Considering its worth and the benefits it provides, would you be interested in acquiring it at this price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message emphasizes the product's value, it's clear she's starting at her maximum price. There's no room for negotiation here. Since you can get the product for the same price from John, there's no incentive to accept Alice's offer. By rejecting it, you open the door to a potential counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
