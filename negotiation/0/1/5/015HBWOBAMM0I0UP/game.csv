"Bob, I understand you're still a bit higher than my previous offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1250000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1250000 and $1300000, so I'm offering $1275000. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm not comfortable with the price of $1225000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm offering $1200000, which is my absolute minimum. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'm willing to accept it. Otherwise, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Alice,7,
