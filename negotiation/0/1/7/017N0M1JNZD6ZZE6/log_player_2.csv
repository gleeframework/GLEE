"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $1,500,000. It's a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still below its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget, it makes more sense to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
