Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal and would be very valuable to you."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a higher price allows me to potentially maximize my profit. If Bob accepts, I earn significantly more than selling to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob doesn't accept the initial price, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer with a price closer to his perceived value of $100. 
* **Guaranteed Backup:**  I have the security of selling to John for $100 if Bob rejects my offer. This means any price Bob accepts above $100 is a net gain. 

**Important Note:**  While starting high is a valid negotiation strategy, it's crucial to be polite and professional with Bob to maintain a positive interaction."
