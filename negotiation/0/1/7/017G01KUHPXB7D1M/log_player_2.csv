"Round 1
Alice's offer:

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $600,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $750,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,000,000. This is a substantial price reduction, and I hope it's a fair compromise we can both agree on.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have another offer, but I'm confident my product is worth more. I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can finalize this deal today.

**Reasoning:**

Alice is unlikely to go below $900,000.  While her product might be worth more to her, you have a firm budget and John's offer meets it perfectly. There's no point in risking further negotiation when you already have an acceptable deal on the table."
