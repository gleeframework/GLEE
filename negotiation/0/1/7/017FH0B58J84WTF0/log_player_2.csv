"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a decent price, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  You're aiming to save as much money as possible and you have 10 rounds to work with.  Rejecting the initial offer allows you to start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $130.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price of $140.  The goal is to gradually get closer to your target price while leaving room for further negotiations. $130 is still a fair price for both parties, as it is below your maximum value of $150 and above Alice's value of $120."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. This is a great product, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $135, which is only $5 more than your counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not be worth the effort. You're already getting a good price, and going through more rounds risks Alice sticking to her $135 offer or even increasing it. Accepting the offer now secures the product at a price within your budget."
