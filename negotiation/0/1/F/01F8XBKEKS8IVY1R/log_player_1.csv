Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and the demand, I'm proposing a price of $18,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering what it can do for you. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a high anchor:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($12,000) and your minimum ($15,000) sets a strong anchor for the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While the initial price is high, it leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down. This makes Bob feel more in control and potentially more agreeable.
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes the ""value"" and ""demand"" without being too specific. This aims to pique Bob's interest and potentially justify the higher price in his mind.
* **Backup plan:** You have a secured buyer (John) at $15,000, ensuring you won't settle for less than your minimum.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's personality:** This strategy assumes you have no prior information about Bob's negotiation style. If you know he's particularly price-sensitive, a slightly lower initial offer might be more effective.
* **Relationship building:** Even in a negotiation, maintaining a positive and respectful tone is crucial, especially if you want to potentially work with Bob in the future."
