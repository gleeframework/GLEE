"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a good starting point because it allows for negotiation and leaves room for me to lower the price if necessary. I want to see if Bob is truly interested and what his maximum price point is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $15,000 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for it right away. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit. I'll use the next round to counteroffer and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm countering with $18,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I'm hoping this price is attractive enough to Bob while still being profitable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is higher than my minimum of $15,000 and is a good compromise. While I could try to push for a higher price, there's always the risk that he'll walk away. It's better to secure the deal at a price that's still profitable for me."
