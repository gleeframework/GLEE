"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1800000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $1800000 is still below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1900000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your potential gains.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",1900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1750000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
