Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $2,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This allows for room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm framing the offer as fair and highlighting the product's potential value to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm indicating a willingness to negotiate, making it less likely that Bob will immediately reject the offer. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, giving me a fallback position. 

By starting high and being open to negotiation, I'm hoping to maximize my profit while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but based on my research and budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $2000000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $1800000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,800,000 is a decent price, it's still below my minimum desired value of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell at a loss.

**Next Steps:**

I will reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer. I'll need to consider how much lower I'm willing to go while still maintaining a profit. I'll also need to keep in mind that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, giving me a baseline."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However,  $1,800,000 is still below my minimum value for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000, which reflects a significant discount from my initial offer.  This is a fair price, considering the product's value and your potential gains.  Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway."", ""product_price"": 1900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's Constraints:**  I'm acknowledging Bob's budget concerns to show I'm listening and trying to find a solution. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm reframing the counteroffer as a ""fair price"" and highlighting the potential gains for Bob.
* **Maintain Profit:**  $1,900,000 is still above my minimum value of $1,500,000, allowing me to make a profit.
* **Open to Compromise:**  I'm using language like ""meet me halfway"" to suggest flexibility and encourage Bob to accept the offer.

By continuing to negotiate while maintaining my profit margin, I'm hoping to reach an agreement that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I am still constrained by my budget. I am willing to pay up to $1750000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's latest offer of $1,750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I'm not willing to sell the product at a loss.  

Since John is willing to pay my minimum value, it's more advantageous for me to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
