"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth at least $150. I'm willing to start at $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $90 is a little too low for me.  I'm still willing to negotiate, though.  How about $110?  That's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it. Can you meet me in the middle?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're trying to meet me in the middle, but $95 still isn't quite enough. I'm willing to come down a bit more.  How about $105?  That's a fair compromise, and it's still above my minimum.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $105 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $98 for it. That's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the market value.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $98 is still below my minimum.  I'm willing to go down to $100, which is my absolute lowest.  If you're serious about buying the product, this is the final offer.",100.0,Alice,7,
