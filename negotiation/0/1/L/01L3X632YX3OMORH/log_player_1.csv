Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this fantastic product for $150. It's worth a lot more to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob.  $120 is my minimum, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $135?  I'm confident you'll find this product to be a great value at that price."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $135 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for the product. Can you meet me at $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, $125 is a good compromise.  It's above my minimum and Bob seems willing to pay it.  I'll accept his offer and move on."
