Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is within your budget, and only $50,000 more than John's offer. Since you are looking to save as much money as possible, this offer is a good balance between getting a good deal and avoiding further negotiation."
