# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm open to discussing this further. What are your thoughts?

To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to come down to $1,700,000. This price better reflects the true value and potential of the product.  What do you think?

$1,700,000 is still above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice to see if they'll come down closer to Bob's ideal price."
