"Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1800000. I believe it holds immense value, and this price reflects that. I'm confident it will be a great investment for you. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $900000 is simply too low for this product. It's worth significantly more.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product while being within a reasonable range for you. Let's find common ground.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the willingness to negotiate, but $1350000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $1050000?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $1050000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1250000. This price is more in line with the product's true value and offers you a good deal.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but $1250000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $1075000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1075000 is still too low for me. Given that this is getting close to the end of our negotiation,  I'm willing to offer a final compromise. Let's go with $1150000.  This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close the deal.  It's time to find a mutually beneficial solution.",1150000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1075000, but no higher. I'm really interested in this product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet at $1075000?",1075000.0,Bob,8,
