"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering both our individual values.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering we're both meeting halfway.  Let's finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price.
