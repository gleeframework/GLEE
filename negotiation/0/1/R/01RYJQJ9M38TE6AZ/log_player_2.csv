"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still $2,000 above Bob's maximum price. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering both our individual values.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,500. Considering the product's value to me is $12,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still $1,500 above Bob's maximum price. While it's a step closer, it's still worth trying to negotiate further. There's still room for both parties to find a compromise. Bob can try a counteroffer to see if he can get closer to his target price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000.  This is a fair price, considering we're both meeting halfway.  Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my desired price. I'll offer it to you for $9,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to me and the value it holds for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $250 away from Bob's maximum, but it's still higher. Bob has already made several counteroffers and it's likely Alice is becoming more firm on her price.  At this point, the risk of continuing negotiations is that Alice might become even more stubborn, and Bob might end up paying more than $8,000.

Buying from John guarantees Bob gets the product at his maximum price point, saving time and potential further negotiation headaches."
