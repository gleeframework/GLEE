"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500? That would still give you a good price and leave me with a reasonable profit. What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,800? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I'm still not comfortable going lower than $10,200. This price is still a great value for you, and it gives me a bit more breathing room on my side. Let's try to find some common ground.",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to pay a premium, but I need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $9,500, which would be $9,850. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9850.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm going to stick to my bottom line of $10,000. That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  This is my final offer.",10000.0,Alice,7,
