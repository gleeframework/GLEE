"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I believe it's a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  I understand the value of the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $500,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair offer considering my budget and the value it represents to me."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```

This counter-offer is a starting point in the negotiation. Here's why:

* **Aggressive but within reason:**  Starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price allows room for negotiation while signaling you're a serious buyer.
* **Justification:** By mentioning your budget and perceived value, you provide a basis for your offer.
* **Open for dialogue:** The tone of the message encourages further discussion and counter-offers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to me, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price range. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit above what I'm comfortable with.  How about we settle on $650,000?  That represents a significant compromise for both of us."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
```

Here's why this counter-offer makes sense:

* **Upward Movement:** We're increasing our offer from $500,000 to $650,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate and find a middle ground.
* **Strategic Positioning:** This offer is exactly halfway between our previous offer and Alice's current offer, encouraging her to continue moving towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** We're still well below John's $800,000 offer, preserving our option to walk away if the negotiation stalls."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $650,000 is still a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'll offer it to you for $725,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's time to cut our losses.  She's unlikely to go much lower than $725,000, and we can get the product from John for $800,000.  The potential savings from further negotiation with Alice aren't worth the risk of her pulling out or our time investment."
