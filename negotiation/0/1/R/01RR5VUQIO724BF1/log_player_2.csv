"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $1000000. It's a rare opportunity, and I believe it holds significant value for you.  Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is enticing, but there's room for negotiation.**  $1,000,000 is a good price, but I have a budget of $1,200,000, so I can afford to push for a lower price. 
* **It's early in the negotiation.**  Rejecting the offer gives me the chance to counteroffer and potentially get a better deal.  There's no need to rush into accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get this product for a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $800,000.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive counteroffer:** I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to signal my seriousness about getting a lower price. 
* **Reasonable starting point:**  $800,000 is a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer, but it's still within my budget. This gives Alice room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much.
* **Open to negotiation:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price.  This keeps the door open for further negotiation."
