Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This is a good starting point for a negotiation. It's ambitious, but it gives me room to lower the price if necessary.  I'm also factoring in the possibility that Bob may have a higher valuation for the product than $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,500,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, it's still above my minimum price point, leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.

Bob has made it clear that he's not willing to budge from his $1,500,000 offer.  Since I can get the same price from John, I'm going to sell to John to avoid further negotiation and secure a sale."
