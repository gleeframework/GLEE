"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to make a serious offer to get us started. I'm looking for $950,000 for the product.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we discuss $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  To be honest, $750,000 is really as high as I can go. If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a compromise, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $800,000? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",800000.0,Alice,5,
