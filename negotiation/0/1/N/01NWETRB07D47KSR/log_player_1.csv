Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product for $1,100,000.  I believe it offers significant value that will greatly benefit you. "",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so aiming for a price close to that maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves some room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Strong Alternative:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate, so the offer should reflect that confidence. 

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough to accept."
