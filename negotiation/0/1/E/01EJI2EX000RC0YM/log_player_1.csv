"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price, and I believe I can get closer to my desired value by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $15,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is a great opportunity to close the deal. While I'd prefer to get a bit more, $15,000 meets my minimum price point and saves me from the risk of further negotiation."
