"Hello Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I believe I can find a better deal elsewhere. I would like to propose a price of $14,000 for the product. Let me know if this is something we can work with.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my target price. How about $16,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make this happen.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $15,000. I hope this meets somewhere in between our values.",15000.0,Bob,4,
