"I'm really interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $850000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're getting close to your target, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $890000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",890000.0,Alice,5,
