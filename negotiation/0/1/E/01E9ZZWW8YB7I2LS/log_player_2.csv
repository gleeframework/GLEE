"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $110. I think it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to get a better price. $110 is still higher than your maximum budget, and you have more rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $110 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go as low as $85. How about we meet in the middle at $100? It's a fair price considering the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $100 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your budget. You have more rounds to negotiate and can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $100 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $90, which is the absolute maximum I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a significant way off from what I need to get for this product. To be honest, I have another potential buyer who's interested at a higher price.  I'd rather work something out with you, but I need you to be closer to my original offer. Would you consider $98? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $98
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, but it's still too high for you. At this point, it's better to take the safe option and buy the product from John for $80. You've already spent several rounds negotiating and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down to your desired price."
