Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""value and potential,"" you subtly justify the higher price without explicitly stating it's worth more than $12,000 to you.
* **Open to Discussion:**  Phrases like ""proposing a price"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" keep the conversation open and invite Bob to counter-offer if he finds the initial price too high.

**Important Note:**  While John provides a safety net at $12,000, securing a deal with Bob at a higher price is ideal. This approach aims to maximize your profit potential."
