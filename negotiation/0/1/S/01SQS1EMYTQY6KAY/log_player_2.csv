"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm looking to get $150 for it.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $150 and Alice's initial offer is also $150, there's no room for negotiation to save money. Buying from John for $150 is the best option as you're guaranteed the product at your price limit."
