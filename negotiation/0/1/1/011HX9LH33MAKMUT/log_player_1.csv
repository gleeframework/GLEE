{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize fairness and mutual benefit to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Open-ended:** I leave the door open for Bob to counter, ensuring the negotiation process continues. 
* **Plan B:** I'm ready to go to John if the negotiation with Bob fails. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully analyze Bob's response and determine my next move based on his counteroffer (or rejection). 
* I'll keep John as a backup option in case the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1050000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob.  I'm willing to go lower than my original offer, but not that low.
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have a guaranteed alternative with John, so I can afford to be firm in my negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. 
* I'll emphasize the value of the product and my willingness to compromise to reach a mutually acceptable agreement.
* I'll remain prepared to accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob fails."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit from my previous offer.  I propose a price of $1,075,000. This still reflects the value of the product, while leaving some room for both of us.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing my willingness to compromise by lowering my offer slightly.
* **Middle Ground:** This price is a good middle ground between my previous offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Positive Framing:** I focus on finding a ""mutually beneficial agreement"" to encourage a cooperative tone.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm still leaving the door open for further negotiations.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll assess Bob's response to this counteroffer.
* If he rejects it, I'll need to decide whether to counter again or move on to John. 
* I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll stick to my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your flexibility. Based on my assessment, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1060000 for your product. I believe this price strikes a balance between our interests. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,060,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,060,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  The negotiation process is getting longer, and I'm concerned it could drag on without a satisfactory outcome.
* **John's offer remains attractive:** John's offer is still a safe and reliable option, giving me a strong fallback.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make one final counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000. This will show my willingness to compromise while remaining firm on my minimum price.
* If Bob rejects my final counteroffer, I'll move forward with selling the product to John.
* I'm prepared to walk away if Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price.  The potential loss of $100,000 is preferable to settling for a significantly lower price."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and our continued dialogue. I'm willing to make one final adjustment to my offer. I propose a price of $1,085,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your latest offer and for being willing to negotiate. I've carefully considered your proposal and am proposing a counteroffer of $1070000 for your product. I believe this offers a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your feedback.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No significant progress:** Bob's counteroffer is only $5,000 higher than his previous offer, and still well below my minimum acceptable price.  The negotiation isn't progressing quickly enough.
* **Time is a factor:** The negotiation process is taking longer than I anticipated, and I'm concerned about the potential for further delays and counteroffers.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  John's offer of $1,200,000 provides a secure and profitable outcome, eliminating the risk and uncertainty associated with continued negotiation.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll politely inform Bob that I've decided to accept John's offer.
* I'll thank him for his time and willingness to negotiate.
* I'll move forward with finalizing the sale to John and securing the higher price."
