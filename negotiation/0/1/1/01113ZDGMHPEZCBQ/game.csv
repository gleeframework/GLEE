"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Can you meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $135. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, Alice, but I'm still not sure I can go up to $135. How about we meet at $125? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to save as much as I can.",125.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to save as much as you can, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $125. I'm willing to make another compromise and offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value you'll get from this product.",130.0,Alice,5,
