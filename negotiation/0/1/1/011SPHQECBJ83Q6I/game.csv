"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product I think you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm offering it at $11,000. I think this is a fair price that reflects its true value. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's the highest I can go.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,800, but that's as high as I can go.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $10,200 for it to make sense for me.  This is my final offer.",10200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price, Alice, but $10,200 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,600, but that's as high as I can go.",9600.0,Bob,6,
