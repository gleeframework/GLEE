Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum.
* **One-Shot Deal:** You have one chance with Bob. If he rejects your offer, you go with John.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit, but not so high that Bob walks away. A good strategy is to:

1. **Start High:** Begin with an offer closer to Bob's valuation.
2. **Leave Room to Negotiate:**  Don't start at his absolute maximum; allow for some back and forth.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a one-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  It highlights the product's value and the exclusivity of the offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Price:** $1,150,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down while still securing a significant profit for you. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could adjust the price and messaging based on your assessment of Bob's negotiating style and risk tolerance."
