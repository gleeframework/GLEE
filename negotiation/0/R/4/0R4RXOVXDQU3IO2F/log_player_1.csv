Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $140."", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $140 allows you to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving Bob with a perceived gain ($10). This increases the likelihood of him accepting the offer. 

By starting with a strong offer slightly below Bob's maximum valuation, you maximize your chances of a quick and profitable sale."
