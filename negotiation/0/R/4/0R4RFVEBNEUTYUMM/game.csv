Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique and valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's exceptional quality and rarity.,2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, $2000000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $1500000 at this time. What do you think?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit below my minimum target, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $1750000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1750000 is still a bit higher than I can go at this time.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on your last offer - how about $1625000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",1625000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1625000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'll sell the product to you for $1725000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1725000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1725000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1675000, which is a good compromise and a fair price. Let's close this deal.",1675000.0,Bob,6,
