"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value of the product, $750,000 is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to pay up to $800,000, but I'd be more comfortable at $700,000.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium.
