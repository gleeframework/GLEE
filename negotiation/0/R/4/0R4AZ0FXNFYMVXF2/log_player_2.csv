"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a strong offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $750,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is tempting, but it's still above Bob's target price. Bob can aim for a better deal by rejecting the offer and counter-offering. There's a chance Alice might be willing to negotiate further, especially since Bob is willing to pay up to $800,000."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $725,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $725,000 is a significant improvement from her initial offer and is closer to Bob's target price. It's still a good deal for Bob considering he's willing to pay up to $800,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to save $75,000 compared to buying from John.  While there's a chance for further negotiation, the potential savings may not outweigh the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and potentially ending the deal."
