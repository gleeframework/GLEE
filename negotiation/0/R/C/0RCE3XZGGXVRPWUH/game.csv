"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to spend closer to $10000 for this product.  Is there any wiggle room in your price?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to spend $10000, but I have to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11500. This is my best offer at this time. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. $11500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider $11000? It's a fair price for both of us, and would allow us to close the deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer you a price of $12250. This is my final compromise. What do you think?",12250.0,Alice,5,
