"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I think it's worth at least $120 to me, so I'm offering it to you for $150.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $150 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer of $80. While I'm open to negotiation, that's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $80 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $130? That still leaves some room for negotiation, but it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $130 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $100, which is a fair compromise, considering my budget. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a price we're both happy with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $100 is still a bit below what I need. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $115? This feels like a fair compromise, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to compromise.  While $115 is closer, I'm still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $105, which is the absolute maximum I can afford.  Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with.  Since I have a guaranteed offer from John for $120, I'm going to sell the product to him."
