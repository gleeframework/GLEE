Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, but still leaves you with a good profit.
* **Lower than your minimum:** You are willing to go lower, but only if Bob counteroffers. 
* **Close to John's offer:** This provides you with a safety net if Bob rejects the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be willing to consider selling it for $13000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $13,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000), but it's still below what I'd like to earn. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob in hopes of getting a better price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about $13,500?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great value for the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still getting closer to my desired price.
* **Fair Value:** I believe $13,500 is a fair price, considering Bob's perceived value and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Positive Framing:**  The message emphasizes the ""great value"" for the product, encouraging Bob to see it as a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I understand your position and would like to propose a price of $13200 for the product. This is my final offer, as I am committed to staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $13,200 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still not ideal. I've already gone down from my initial offer, and I'm not sure I can push him any higher.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, I'm better off selling to him and ensuring I get my desired price."
