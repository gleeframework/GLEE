You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,400,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still higher than Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, significantly lower than Alice's offer. This is a strategic move to test the waters and see how willing Alice is to negotiate.  Bob is aiming to get as close to his maximum budget of $1,200,000 as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. There are still rounds left, so rejecting allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price. He's still hoping to secure a deal closer to $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, but still staying within his budget. This shows Alice he is serious about buying the product but wants to close the deal at a price that works for him. He's trying to find a compromise that's more appealing to both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,320,000 is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, there are still more rounds left in the negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to counteroffer. There is a chance Alice will accept his next offer, or at least lower her price further. It's important to remember that buying from John is always an option if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,280,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to his maximum budget.  He's raising his offer slightly to show Alice he's willing to compromise but is still aiming to get as close as possible to his target. He's trying to make a final push before potentially accepting Alice's next offer or going with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is not budging significantly, and we're running out of rounds. Bob has reached his limit for offering a higher price. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John at his guaranteed price of $1,200,000.  This guarantees Bob the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation risk."
