Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd really appreciate.  I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a fair price considering its value.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's a bit above my minimum but leaves room for negotiation. This gives Bob some incentive to negotiate but also positions me well to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $120 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  I'm willing to pay $100 for it, if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get a better price from Bob.  I'll counter his offer and see if we can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're interested. While $100 is tempting, I'm still hoping for something closer to my initial price. How about $110? That's a good compromise and still leaves us both with a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a compromise, but $110 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $105.  Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's still higher than selling to John, and we've been going back and forth for a few rounds now.  It's time to close the deal."
