"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, it's still a significant sum. There's potential to save more by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product, while still being a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Drop:** This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate but also sets a clear starting point for a lower price.
* **Fair Price:** While $850,000 is a considerable sum, it allows for potential compromise and avoids being seen as too lowball. 
* **Focus on Value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product, making the counteroffer seem reasonable and not solely based on trying to get the lowest possible price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to sell it to you for $850000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** Alice has met you halfway, reducing her price from $950,000 to $900,000. This shows a willingness to negotiate.
* **Good Price:** While you may prefer to pay less, $900,000 is a good price compared to the initial $950,000 and the alternative of buying from John for $1,000,000.
* **Avoid Stalemate:** Further negotiation could lead to a stalemate and potentially a price increase if Alice becomes frustrated. Accepting now ensures a good price and avoids the risk of losing the opportunity."
