"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects its potential. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,500,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and potentially negotiate a lower price. You have room to negotiate since you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but the product's value is quite high. I could consider coming down slightly to $1,375,000. This offer represents a significant investment for you, but also ensures you acquire a valuable asset.

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above your ideal price point.  It's worth attempting another counteroffer to see if you can push for a price closer to your desired range. You still have room to negotiate as you're willing to pay up to $1,500,000."
