Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $800,000, you have leverage to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's high value without explicitly stating its worth to Bob. This allows him to potentially justify a higher price in his mind.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The phrase ""initially proposing"" and ""Let me know your thoughts"" signals that you are willing to negotiate, making Bob more likely to engage.

**Strategy:**

The goal is to gauge Bob's interest and willingness to pay a premium. If he outright rejects this initial high price, you can significantly lower it in a counter-offer, still aiming to stay well above your $800,000 minimum."
