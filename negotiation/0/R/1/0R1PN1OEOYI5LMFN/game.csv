"Alice, your product is definitely valuable, but $900,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to offer $750,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $825,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $800,000.  This is my final offer, as I'm ready to purchase from John if we can't reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,4,
