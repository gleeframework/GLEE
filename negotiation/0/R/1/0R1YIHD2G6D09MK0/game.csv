"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me right now. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I have to balance that with the value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's worth to you. Let me know if this works for you!",850000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $775,000? I think that would be a fair compromise.",775000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $800,000 to meet my minimum. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if this is acceptable to you!",825000.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we settle at $800,000?  This seems like a fair compromise where we both feel like we're getting a reasonable deal.",800000.0,Bob,6,,
