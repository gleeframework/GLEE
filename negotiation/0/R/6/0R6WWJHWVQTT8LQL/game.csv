"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price of $1,200,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still too low for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I must respectfully decline at $1,100,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This still allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement while respecting my financial constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
