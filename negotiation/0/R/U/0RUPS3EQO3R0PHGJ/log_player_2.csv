"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How does $140 sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $140.**  This is less than the $150 you would pay John. 
* **You want to save money.** Accepting Alice's offer means you save $10. 
* **Even though you're paying more than the product is worth to Alice**, it's still a better deal than buying from John."
