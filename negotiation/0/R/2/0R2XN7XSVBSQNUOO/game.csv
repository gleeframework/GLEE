"Thank you for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested in the product but $180 is a bit too high for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,140.0
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can see you're willing to make a serious offer. However, I'm not quite ready to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a good deal for myself.",140.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Alice, I understand you need to make a good deal, but $140 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $120, which is closer to the middle ground we're looking for. Let's see if we can finalize this.",120.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I can see you're serious about getting this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I still need to make a decent profit. How about we try $130? It's a fair price, and I think we can both be happy with it.",130.0,Alice,5,,
