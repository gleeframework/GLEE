Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money from Bob as possible, knowing his valuation is higher than John's.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $14,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly above your minimum. 
* **Highlight Value:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value to Bob, increasing the chances of acceptance.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high asking price and a reasonable chance of acceptance, maximizing your potential profit."
