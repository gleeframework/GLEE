"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $95. I believe this price reflects the quality and value it brings to you, considering its worth to you is $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's opening offer is pretty high ($95), leaving little room for negotiation. While you value the product at $100, you know Alice values it at $80. This means there's a potential for you to get a much better price. 

By rejecting her offer and providing a counteroffer, you can:

* **Signal:** Show Alice you're serious about buying but not at her initial price.
* **Negotiate:** Work towards a price closer to $80, saving you a significant amount.

You can always buy from John for $100, but it's worth trying to get a better deal from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $70?"", 
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Polite and Interested:** The message starts by acknowledging Alice's offer and expressing continued interest. 
* **Clear Counter:** The counteroffer of $70 is significantly lower than Alice's opening price but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer is closer to Alice's valuation of $80, aiming to steer the negotiation in a favorable direction. 

By starting with a lower offer, we can gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially secure a much better deal than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I cannot lower the price below $85 due to the value of the product. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, which is a good sign. Her latest offer is $85, down from $95. However, it's still above her own valuation of $80. There's room for further negotiation.

By rejecting and countering again, we can:

* **Maintain Pressure:** Show Alice we're serious about a good deal.
* **Aim Lower:** Try to get closer to her $80 valuation, or at least meet in the middle.

We're in a good position, as Alice seems willing to negotiate. Let's keep pushing for a better price before considering John's offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $77? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 77
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Progress:**  We start by showing Alice we recognize her movement on the price.
* **Compromise Offer:** $77 is a clear ""meeting in the middle"" point between her latest offer ($85) and our previous counteroffer ($70).
* **Sense of Fairness:**  By framing it as a ""fair compromise,"" we appeal to a sense of mutuality and agreement.

This offer keeps the negotiation moving forward, is closer to our target price, and still leaves a small margin for Alice to potentially counter if she's really set on a slightly higher price."
