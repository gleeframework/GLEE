Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,200,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin of $300,000.
* **One Shot:** You have one chance to make a deal with Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your profit but low enough that Bob finds it a good deal compared to his $1,500,000 valuation. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name]. I know it's something you'll find immense value in. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Why This Offer Makes Sense**

* **Strong Opening:** It positions the product as valuable and desirable.
* **Significant Profit:**  You secure a $200,000 profit above your minimum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  While unlikely, Bob might counter-offer, giving you a chance to potentially secure even more.
* **Time Pressure:**  The ""limited-time"" element adds urgency, making Bob less likely to stall. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. You could experiment with different price points within that $1,200,000 - $1,500,000 range to see how it changes the outcome."
