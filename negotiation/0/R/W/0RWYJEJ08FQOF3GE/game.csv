"Hi Alice,  $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm very interested in the product but I'm only able to go up to $8,200 at this time.  Let me know if that works for you.",8200.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8,200 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $8,800. Would that work for you?",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $8,800 is still a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm happy to meet in the middle at $8,500.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that we're getting close! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,800 and $8,500. How about $8,650? Would that work for you?",8650.0,Alice,5,
