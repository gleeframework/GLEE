"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm looking to stay within a budget of $800,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that? I believe we can still find a mutually beneficial solution.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your honesty. To move forward, I am willing to negotiate closer to your suggested price.

I look forward to your consideration.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for adjusting your offer. While I appreciate the effort, $850,000 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm firm on my original budget of $800,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can finalize the deal. ",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $825,000 is still a little above my budget. I'm ready to close the deal right now at $800,000. Let's make this happen! ",800000.0,Bob,6,
