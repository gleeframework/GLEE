"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about $110?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product is worth it.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $109. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to move on.",109.0,Alice,5,
