Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. I'm thinking of a price of $850,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it will bring you a substantial return.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you believe the product has significant value, but I still think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $825,000 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate. While his offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still well within the range to make a profit above John's offer. I'll counteroffer in hopes of reaching a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about we settle at $875,000? This feels like a good compromise that reflects the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $875,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go a bit higher than my previous offer, so I'm thinking of a price of $825,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has not budged from his previous offer of $825,000, signaling this is likely his ceiling. While I could push for more, it risks a stalemate or him walking away. Accepting this offer secures a $25,000 profit over John's offer and avoids potentially lengthy negotiations."
