Round 3

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product to you.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This would still give you a substantial saving and allow me to achieve a fair price. Let's close this deal.
