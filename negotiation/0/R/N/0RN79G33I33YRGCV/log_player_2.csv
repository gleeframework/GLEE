"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation process by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still higher than her minimum acceptable price. It allows for room to compromise and signals Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining a firm stance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price and closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue trying to drive the price down further, potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your original offer and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to inch closer to Alice's price while still staying within his budget. By offering $1,000,000, Bob is showing his willingness to compromise and making a reasonable counteroffer that could potentially lead to a deal in the next round."
