"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation, while also significantly exceeding my minimum desired price.  I believe this strategy will give me the best chance of securing a favorable deal with Bob, while keeping the option to sell to John as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering your asking price and my budget. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum desired price of $800,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't accept an offer that doesn't at least meet my minimum. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $950,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a good value for you. Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your original offer and my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is above my minimum price of $800,000 and a good deal for me.  While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, it's getting late in the negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether.  I'll accept this offer and move forward."
