Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $120.  It's in excellent condition and I think you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $120 is well above your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This allows for some back and forth without immediately hitting your bottom line.
* **It's a reasonable price:** Considering the product is worth $150 to Bob,  $120 is a fair starting point. 

Let's see what Bob's response is!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $120 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is better than selling to John, it's still below my desired price point. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  That's a fair price for both of us. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
