Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $700,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident we can both be happy with this price.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I've already met you halfway and given you a significant discount. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much profit. I'm counteroffering at $725,000, as you suggested, but I'm only willing to go this low because I think the product is worth it to you. I'm not budging further.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I don't think splitting the difference is quite fair considering the value I know you place on the product. I'm willing to meet you at $700,000, but I need a bit more to make it worth my while. I'm counteroffering at $720,000, which is still a good deal for you, but also reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $720,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close!  I understand you value the product, and I'm willing to offer $710,000. That's only $10,000 away from your last counter, and it would allow us to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 710000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $710,000, but I still think I can get a better deal. I'm willing to give you a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much money on the table. I'm counteroffering at $715,000, which is still a good deal for you, but I'm not going to go any lower. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $715,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $715,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

Alice seems quite firm and unlikely to go much lower. Accepting at $715,000 secures a decent discount while avoiding the risk of missing out entirely and having to pay John's higher price."
