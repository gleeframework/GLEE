Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Offer Price:** I'm offering the product for $9,000. This is a price that is slightly lower than my minimum value ($10,000) but still higher than Bob's estimated value ($8,000). This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but it also leaves some room for me to potentially get a better price.
* **Message:** My message is friendly and encouraging, but it also emphasizes the value of the product. I'm trying to create a positive atmosphere for the negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize potential profit:** By starting with a higher price, I increase the possibility of securing a sale closer to my desired value.
* **Encourage negotiation:** Offering a price that is higher than Bob's estimated value encourages him to counteroffer, which opens up the possibility of finding a mutually agreeable price.
* **Maintain control:** I can always accept John's offer if negotiations with Bob break down. This acts as a safety net and ensures that I don't settle for a price lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $8,500 for it. I hope this revised offer is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is higher than his initial estimate, it's still below my minimum value of $10,000. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counteroffer with a price that's closer to my minimum value, but still potentially acceptable to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little bit to $9,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer Price:** I'm counteroffering with $9,500, which is $1,000 higher than Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while still leaving room for a potential compromise.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer while expressing my desire for a higher price. My message remains positive and emphasizes the value of the product, encouraging Bob to consider my counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my desired profit:** While lowering my price from the initial offer, I'm still keeping it above my minimum value and above Bob's initial offer.
* **Signal my willingness to compromise:** Showing flexibility in my price is crucial for maintaining a positive negotiation environment.
* **Leave room for further negotiation:** Offering a price that's still potentially acceptable to Bob leaves room for a final compromise that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I must stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's final offer of $9,000 is very close to my minimum value of $10,000. While I would prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, accepting this offer still gives me a decent profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely. It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the sale and the time invested in negotiation.

Here's why I choose to accept:

* **Profit:**  The sale will still result in a profit of $1,000, which is a significant amount.
* **Time:**  Continuing the negotiation may lead to further delays and uncertainty. Accepting Bob's offer allows me to close the deal quickly and move on.
* **Risk:**  Rejecting Bob's offer and counteroffering might risk losing the sale altogether.  John is a backup option, but there's no guarantee he'll still be available or willing to buy at the same price.

This decision balances my desire for a higher price with the need to secure a sale and maximize my overall earnings."
