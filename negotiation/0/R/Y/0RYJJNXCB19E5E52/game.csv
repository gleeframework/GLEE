"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the market value is $1,500,000 to you.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you see in the product, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000, which is a fair price considering your own valuation.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $975,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $975,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as that. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a good compromise.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
