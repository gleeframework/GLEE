Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at a special price of $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 135
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob values the product at $120, we don't want to start too low. There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering it at $135 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer, or at least feel like he's getting a slightly better deal than the initial price.
* **Above our Minimum:**  Most importantly, $135 is still a significant profit margin for us, as we're willing to sell it to John for $150 if Bob declines."
