"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm hoping for a price closer to $1,250,000.  That would make this deal even more appealing to me.  What do you think?",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to get a better deal, but I'm still looking to maximize my profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and my initial offer.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, I'm still a little hesitant at that price.  Could we settle on $1,300,000?  That would be a great price for both of us, and I'd be able to move forward with the purchase.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,325,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,315,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope you can understand that.",1315000.0,Alice,5,
