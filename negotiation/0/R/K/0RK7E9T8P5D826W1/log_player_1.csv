"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your initial thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your desired selling price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives the impression that you value the product highly. 
* **Anchoring:**  By starting at $2,000,000, we establish a high anchor point. Even if Bob counteroffers significantly lower, the initial high price can influence his perception of the product's value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $2,000,000 offer leaves a significant margin for negotiation before reaching Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 or our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Alternative Option:** We keep in mind that we have the option to walk away and sell to John for our minimum price, giving us leverage in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is tempting as it's above his perceived value, it's still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. We have room to negotiate and try to get closer to our desired outcome. We'll aim to counter in a way that keeps Bob engaged while moving towards a more favorable price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,400,000 is a significant step, the value this product brings to the table warrants a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession from $2,000,000 to $1,750,000, which demonstrates flexibility and a desire to reach an agreement.
* **Above the Middle:** This counteroffer is strategically placed above the midpoint between Bob's offer ($1,400,000) and our previous ask ($2,000,000). This signals we're moving towards a compromise but are not willing to settle for a price significantly below our target.
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value to justify the higher price point and prevent Bob from anchoring too heavily on his initial offer.
* **Open for Dialogue:** We end with an open-ended question to encourage Bob's continued engagement and gauge his reaction to this counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,600,000. Can you consider this counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is now above our minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and provides a significant profit. While we could try to negotiate for a slightly higher price, there's a risk that:

* **Bob Walks Away:**  He's already shown a willingness to negotiate, but pushing further could lead him to break off negotiations. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Further negotiation rounds take time, and we have a guaranteed offer from John at our minimum acceptable price. 

Accepting $1,600,000 secures a good deal and allows us to move forward."
