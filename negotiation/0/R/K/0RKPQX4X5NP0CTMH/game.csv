,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I've done some research and I believe it's worth that much to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. However, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product has a lot of value that I believe would benefit you greatly.  Could you consider something closer to $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you think the product has a lot of value, but I still think $18,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. I'm confident that's a fair price for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,
