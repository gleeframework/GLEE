"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I can't quite go that low yet. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to move closer to my target price. Let's make this happen!",1150000.0,Alice,3,
