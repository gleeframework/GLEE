"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this moment.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price is fair for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $850000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900000. I think this is a fair price that reflects the product's value to you, while also being reasonable for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
