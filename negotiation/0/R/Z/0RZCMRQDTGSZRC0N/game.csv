"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product but I have a limited budget. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $12,000? That would be a fair compromise.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  I could meet you halfway at $14,500. This is my final offer.",14500.0,Alice,5,
