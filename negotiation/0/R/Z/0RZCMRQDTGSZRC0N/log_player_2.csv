"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. I'm confident this is a fair starting point for discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $20,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  This is a significant reduction and reflects my desire to find a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but $12,000 is too low for me to consider.  I could meet you halfway at $14,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500

Explanation:  Alice is stuck at a price that's too high. It's unlikely she'll come down significantly from $14,500, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer. You have a guaranteed option with John for $8,000, which is a much better deal."
