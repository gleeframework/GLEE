"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, showing a willingness to negotiate while still leaving room for potential further concessions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000, which is a good deal for Bob.  While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will reject further counteroffers and he might end up buying from John at $1,000,000. Accepting the offer ensures a lower price than John's, and there's not much more to gain through further negotiation."
