Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that amount as possible while still making a profit.

Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

Let's see what Bob has to say!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but it's still a decent price. Since I'm trying to maximize my earnings, I'll decide to:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer and send a counteroffer to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","I'll try to get closer to the true value of the product to Bob. Since he was willing to pay $900,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher.

Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $920,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
