"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth every penny.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the item, but I'm looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? I believe that would be a fair compromise.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I have to say that $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great deal.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'd like to propose $120 as a counteroffer. I believe this price is reasonable for both of us, considering the value of the product.",120.0,Bob,4,
