"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective on the market value. However, the product's intrinsic value and potential warrant a higher price.  I can come down to $900,000. This offer represents a significant investment on your end, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $750,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,4,
