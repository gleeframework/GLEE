Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,350,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than John. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying closer to Bob's perceived value. This price gives Bob a significant discount while still earning me a substantial profit over my minimum. 
* **Backup Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can always rely on John's guaranteed purchase at $1,000,000."
