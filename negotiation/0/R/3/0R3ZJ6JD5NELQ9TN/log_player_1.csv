{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a significant discount for Bob, but it still leaves a good profit margin for Alice.  If Bob rejects the offer, Alice can adjust her counteroffers based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is a better price than John's offer, Alice can likely get closer to her desired price by continuing the negotiation.  She has a good understanding of Bob's value for the product and can use this to her advantage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,250? I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not willing to go above that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice should accept Bob's offer.  While she would prefer to get closer to $13,000, Bob's counteroffer of $12,250 is still a good deal for her. It's significantly higher than John's offer and is within the range of what she considers acceptable. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing the sale altogether, as Bob seems firm on his price."
