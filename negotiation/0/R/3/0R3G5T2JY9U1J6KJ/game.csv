"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! It's a tempting product, but $12000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10000, which is my absolute limit. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $10000 is your absolute limit, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer, and that's $11500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value. Let me know what you think.",11500.0,Alice,5,
