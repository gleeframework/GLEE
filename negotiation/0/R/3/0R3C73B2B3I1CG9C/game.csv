"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'd like to buy the product for $9,500. I think that's a fair price considering the market value is only $10,000 to me. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective on the market value,  $9,500 is significantly lower than what I need to sell this item. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go below $11,000. It's still a great deal considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my counteroffer and coming down to $11,000. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for the product. This is the best I can do, and I hope we can reach an agreement at this price.",10800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,800.  That's a good step in the right direction, but I'm still just a little too far apart.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,400.  This is a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",11400.0,Alice,5,
