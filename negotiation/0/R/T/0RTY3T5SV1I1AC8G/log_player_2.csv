"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in.  It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While the product is worth $120 to you, you are aiming to save money. A price of $100 is still too high.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation since Alice is willing to sell for less than your maximum value. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing you can buy from John for $120 gives you leverage during negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
