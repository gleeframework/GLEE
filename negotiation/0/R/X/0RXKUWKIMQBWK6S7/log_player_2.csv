"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider your proposal. However, I'm not willing to sell it for $650,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is a compromise, as it's still a significant discount from my initial offer of $900,000. What do you think?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, which would be $812,500. This is my final counteroffer. If you're willing to accept, I'll sell the product to you at this price. If not, I'll need to consider other options.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and her final offer is still higher than John's price. It makes more financial sense to buy from John at this stage and avoid further negotiation."
