"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to make another concession and sell the product to you for $8,250. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I still need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,000. It's a fair price considering the value it brings, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",8000.0,Alice,7,
