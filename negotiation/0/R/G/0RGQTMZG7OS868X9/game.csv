"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $13,000.  This is my best offer.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go to $10,000.  This is my final offer, and if it's not acceptable, I'll have to go with another seller.",10000.0,Bob,4,
