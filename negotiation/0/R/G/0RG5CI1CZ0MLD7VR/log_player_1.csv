"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a higher price from Bob. I'll reject his offer and see if I can counteroffer for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $95. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $85 is close to John's offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial price of $100. I'll see if I can convince Bob to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm counteroffering at $90 again.  This is a fair price, considering Bob's last offer and my desire to get as close to my initial offer as possible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $82. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's offers are getting lower, and I'm running out of rounds.  Selling to John guarantees me $80, which is better than the risk of getting an even lower offer from Bob or ending up with no sale at all."
