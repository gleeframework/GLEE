"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to negotiate down from this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $120. I hope Bob will be willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $115 is only $5 less than my minimum acceptable price, and we are already halfway through the rounds. It's getting risky to continue negotiating, and selling to John for $120 is a better option if I continue to reject offers. Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice at this point."
