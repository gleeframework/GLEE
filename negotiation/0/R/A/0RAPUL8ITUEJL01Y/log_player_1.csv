Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to make this very attractive for you. How about we start the conversation at $1,300,000?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High, But Not Too High:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000. 
* **Confidentiality:** Mentioning a ""confidential minimum price"" creates a sense of intrigue and implies that the offer is already a good deal.
* **Encouraging Negotiation:** The phrase ""start the conversation"" invites Bob to counter-offer and engage in a negotiation, increasing the chances of reaching a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice's safety net is John, ensuring she won't settle for less than $1,500,000. This knowledge empowers her to negotiate from a stronger position."
