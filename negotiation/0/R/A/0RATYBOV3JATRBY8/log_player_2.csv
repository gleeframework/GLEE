"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think it's a great deal for you considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is a good price, it's still above your maximum budget of $120.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I really appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to go down to $95?  It's still a good deal for you, and I'd be happy to buy it then."", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $105?  It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $105 is within your budget of $120 and is closer to your ideal price of $95 than John's offer of $120. Accepting this offer is the most beneficial option as it allows you to buy the product at a lower price than John would sell it for."
