"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $140.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* The product is worth $150 to you, but you'd prefer to pay less.
* Alice's offer of $140 is better than John's $150, but you can still do better.
* You'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice. If you can't get a better deal, you'll buy from John."
