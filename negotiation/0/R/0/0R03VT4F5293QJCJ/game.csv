"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is quite a ways from what I have in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? I'm confident this product will be incredibly valuable to your business.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the price I'm willing to pay.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
