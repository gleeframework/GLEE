"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're looking to save as much money as possible. While $140 is a better price than $150, you can potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since Alice is willing to sell the product for $120, starting with a $130 counteroffer is a reasonable first step. It's a significant discount from her initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $142. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $142
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than your initial counteroffer. It's still better than John's price, but you can likely push for a better deal with continued negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for more rounds of bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer was higher than your initial one, so you've raised your offer slightly to $135. This shows you're willing to compromise but still want a good deal. It's important to move the price closer to her minimum, but not too quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still too high.  You've already demonstrated your willingness to negotiate, and it's worth another round to try and get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 138}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to your target price, but it's still too high.  You're increasing your offer by $3, showing you're willing to compromise, but also that you're not giving in easily. This is a strategic move to potentially pressure Alice into accepting a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $148. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $148
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now higher than John's price.  It's unlikely that she'll come down further, and with only three rounds remaining, the risk of not getting a deal is too high.  Buying from John at $150 ensures you get the product while staying within your budget."
