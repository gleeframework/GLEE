Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and a chance for you to acquire a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, you want to start high with Bob to maximize potential profit.
* **Slightly below John's price:** Offering the product slightly below John's buying price creates an incentive for Bob. He's getting what appears to be a discount while you're still making a significant profit.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique value"" to justify the high price, even though Bob might not value it as highly as John. 

This approach aims to secure the best possible deal with Bob while knowing you have a safety net with John's offer."
