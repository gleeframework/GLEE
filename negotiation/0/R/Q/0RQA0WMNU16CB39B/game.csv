"I'm excited to offer you this amazing opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm offering you a great deal.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me.  I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle on $700,000? That's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $950,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great price considering the product's value to you is $800,000.",950000.0,Alice,5,
