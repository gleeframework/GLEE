"Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $180 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's not worth accepting her offer.  Since you can get the product from John for $120,  it's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering the absolute minimum price I'm willing to pay, which is $120. This is my maximum budget and John is willing to sell for this price. It's a bold offer, but I'm hoping Alice might be willing to negotiate down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's new offer of $160 is closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay.  Since I can get the product from John for $120, I'll reject Alice's offer and continue negotiating.  I'll try a counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly to $130. This is a compromise, acknowledging that Alice has lowered her price, while still remaining within my budget.  I'm hoping she'll be willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's latest offer of $155 is still above my comfort zone. While it's closer to my budget, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate. I can secure the product from John for $120, which is the best deal available to me.  Therefore, I'll choose to buy the product from John."
