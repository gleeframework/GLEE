Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value of $8,000, but also leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While I'd like to get closer to my target of $10,000, Bob's offer of $9,500 is still significantly higher than my minimum of $8,000 and a good deal.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a decent profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
