"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one last concession. Considering the product's value to you is $1500000, I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need you to throw in some additional value to make it worth my while. I'm thinking a 5-year warranty and a maintenance package would be a good starting point. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,9,
