"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $550,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I don't think I can go any higher than $550,000.",550000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to pay $610,000. I've already made it clear that I'm willing to pay up to $600,000, and I'm not going to budge from that price.
