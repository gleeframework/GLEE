"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,700,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's work together to find a solution.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This still represents a significant value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work. Let's try to find a middle ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen.",950000.0,Bob,4,
