Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $8,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $7,750. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $8,000. It's better to secure the deal with John for $8,000 rather than risk Alice increasing her price or the negotiation failing."
