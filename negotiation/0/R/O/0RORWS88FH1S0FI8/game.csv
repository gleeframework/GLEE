"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I agree this product would be valuable for my business, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $900,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. Would you be open to $700,000? I feel this price point would be a fair compromise for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
