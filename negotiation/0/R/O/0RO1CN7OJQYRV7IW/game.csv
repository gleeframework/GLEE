"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still leaves room for you to benefit from the product's value, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know your thoughts.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm glad you're considering my budget constraints. Could we agree on $8,750 for the product? This would allow me to stay within my spending limit while still getting good value for the product.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. While $8,750 is closer to my desired price, I'd like to propose $8,900. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to achieve a beneficial outcome. Let's close this deal!",8900.0,Alice,5,
