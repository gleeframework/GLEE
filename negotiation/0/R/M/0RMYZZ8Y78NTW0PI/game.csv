"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I know it's even more valuable to you. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, which reflects its unique value and potential. Let me know your thoughts!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  It's a game changer for your business!  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal happen.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I hear you, but $1,000,000 simply isn't enough.  This product has the potential to dramatically increase your profits. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  That's a fair price that reflects the product's value and gives us both a good outcome. Let's make this happen!",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand we're getting close.  $950,000 is still a bit low. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us. What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,7,

"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on our previous discussions, I would like to propose a final price of $975,000 for the product.",975000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we've been through a lot of back and forth, and I appreciate your persistence.  $975,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  This is my final offer: $990,000.  It's a fair compromise, and it allows us to both walk away happy.  Let's make this deal happen!",990000.0,Alice,9,
