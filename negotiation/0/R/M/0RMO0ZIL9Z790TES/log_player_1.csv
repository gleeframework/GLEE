"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $135. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still lower than my minimum ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to my target while still being attractive to Bob.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $125. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** Even though I want to close the deal, Bob's offer of $125 is below my minimum of $150. Accepting this would result in a loss for me.
* **Room for counter-offer:**  I'm confident that I can secure a higher price through further negotiation. 
* **Selling to John is a backup:**  While John offers a higher price, I prefer to see if I can get closer to my target with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to negotiate. How about $130? It's a fair price, considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 130} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:**  My counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($135) and Bob's offer ($125). This shows a willingness to compromise and hopefully incentivizes Bob to accept.
* **Still Above My Minimum:** $130 is still above my minimum price of $150, so I'm not losing money on the deal.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of the potential benefits."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not sure about the price. I can do $128, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** Bob's offer of $128 is still below my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is ongoing:**  There's still a gap, but we're getting closer. I'm willing to continue the negotiation to try to bridge this gap.
* **Selling to John is a fallback:** While John offers the best price, I want to see if I can get a better deal with Bob before resorting to that option."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. How about we meet in the middle at $130? That's a fair price considering the product's value, and it's closer to what I can accept. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Staying Firm:**  I'm sticking with $130 because it's above my minimum and still within the negotiation range.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  I highlight the ""fairness"" of the price and the value of the product to reiterate its worth.
* **Asking for Agreement:** I end with a question to encourage Bob to respond and hopefully accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $130. I can do $127, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching a Limit:** Bob's offer of $127 is still below my minimum price of $150.  We've gone through several rounds, and it seems we've reached an impasse. 
* **Time is Running Out:**  We're nearing the end of the allotted rounds, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will lead to a price I'm comfortable with. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price and eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob. While it's not my ideal price, it's the most sensible option in this situation."
