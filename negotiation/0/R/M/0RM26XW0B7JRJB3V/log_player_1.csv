Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120, hoping to get a good deal. I'm confident that Bob will find the product valuable, and I'm willing to negotiate further if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial asking price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, and I'm confident I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm countering with $115. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe this is a fair price, considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer is my minimum price, and I don't see any room for further negotiation.  Since John is also willing to pay that price, I'll sell to him to avoid further back-and-forth."
