Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I know you're interested in. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I was hoping to keep my budget under $80. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum desired price of $120.  I'll try to counteroffer him and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget of $80, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $95?  This gives us both some room to work with. "", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Could you possibly consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. I'm starting to feel like we're at an impasse. While I understand his budget, it's still too far below what I'm comfortable with. I'll counteroffer again, but if this doesn't work, I might consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to be flexible here, but I can't go any lower than $90.  This is a significant discount from my original asking price, and it's the best I can offer.  If you're not able to meet me halfway at $90, I'm going to have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Unfortunately, I still can't meet you at $90. I would like to propose $85 as my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We've been going back and forth with Bob for a while, and it's clear he's not willing to budge much.  While $85 is better than $80, it's still quite a bit below my minimum goal.  John's offer of $120 is significantly better, and it's time to take it."
