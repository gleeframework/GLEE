"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your expertise. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000.  What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is quite a bit above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective.  While $800,000 is a respectable figure, I'm confident that this product's true value is significantly higher. To move towards a mutually agreeable outcome, I'm proposing a price of $1,000,000. This reflects a compromise while still recognizing the product's worth.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,000,000 is still beyond my reach. To bridge the gap, I'm offering $900,000. This reflects a substantial increase from my initial offer, showing my genuine interest. I believe this price is fair, considering the value of the product for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
