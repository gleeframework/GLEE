Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1800000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,800,000. This is a high price, but it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  

Here's why I'm starting high:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  A higher starting point gives me the best chance of securing a price closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  If Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium to get the product.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I can negotiate down from this price if Bob counteroffers, but I'll still have a buffer to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with.

However, I'm keeping in mind that:

* **John's Offer:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000, so I won't accept any offer lower than that. 
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob's valuation of $800,000 tells me he'll likely reject this initial offer, but it's worth seeing if he's willing to pay more than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I believe I can negotiate a better price. Here's why:

* **Room for Improvement:**  I'm confident I can push Bob higher than $1,200,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a safety net with John's offer of $1,500,000. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,500,000 or somewhere in between. I'll keep in mind Bob's valuation and try to find a compromise that benefits both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,600,000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,600,000. This is a significant increase from his offer of $1,200,000, but it's still lower than my initial offer of $1,800,000. Here's why I'm doing this:

* **Finding Middle Ground:** This price represents a compromise between Bob's offer and my desired price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By not immediately accepting his offer, I'm demonstrating that I'm not desperate for a sale and I'm willing to negotiate.
* **John's Offer:**  I can still turn to John if Bob rejects this offer, so I'm not risking too much.

I believe this counteroffer is fair and reasonable. It gives Bob a good price while also ensuring I receive a profit closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has stubbornly stuck to his offer of $1,200,000. While I could continue to counteroffer, I'm realizing that:

* **Time is Money:**  Negotiating further might take time, and I'm losing potential profits by delaying the sale.
* **John's Guarantee:** John is a sure thing, guaranteeing me $1,500,000. 
* **Limited Upside:**  I'm unlikely to get much more than $1,200,000 from Bob, and even if I do, it might not be worth the effort and risk.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. It's the most efficient and profitable choice at this point."
