"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant returns you'll see. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 undervalues the product significantly. I could consider coming down to $1,100,000.  This is a fairer offer considering the potential returns you'll gain.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I value your interest, $700,000 is still too low.  My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than reasonable considering the value you'll receive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $950,000.  While she might still be willing to negotiate, it's not worth the risk for Bob. John offers a guaranteed price of $800,000, which is a significant savings and ensures Bob stays within his budget."
