"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential. To be fair, I'm not comfortable with that price point. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000. I'm proposing a new offer of $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,3,
