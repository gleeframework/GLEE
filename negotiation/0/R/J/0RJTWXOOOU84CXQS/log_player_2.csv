"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its value. With that in mind, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm eager to hear your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. Considering our previous offer and your counteroffer, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $700,000. I'm proposing a new offer of $800,000. This is the highest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair compromise given the product's worth to you.
