"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial price of $2,250,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Starting significantly higher than both Bob's value and your minimum allows room for negotiation. It signals that you value the product highly and sets a strong anchor for the discussion. 
* **Leaving John as leverage:** While you have John as a backup, it's too early to reveal this. Using him as silent leverage allows you to push for a higher price with Bob.
* **Positive framing:** The message focuses on the product's value and your confidence in it, aiming to influence Bob's perception and encourage a counteroffer closer to your desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That initial price is a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly below both your minimum and his perceived value. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. While selling to John is an option, it's still early in the negotiation. There's room to counter and gauge Bob's willingness to move closer to a mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $800,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product. I'm willing to adjust my price to $1,900,000 to find a middle ground. I believe this reflects the product's value while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but strategic reduction:**  The large price drop from $2,250,000 to $1,900,000 signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, it remains well above both your minimum and Bob's initial offer, keeping the negotiation focused on a higher value.
* **Reiterating value:**  The message again emphasizes the product's worth, subtly reminding Bob of its potential and justifying the price.
* **Seeking a middle ground:** Framing the counteroffer as a compromise encourages Bob to reciprocate with a more reasonable offer. You're aiming to move him closer to the $1,500,000 mark."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product's value, but I have budget constraints. I can go up to $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but it's still significantly below your minimum. It's time to show him you're serious about the value and willing to walk away. Rejecting keeps the negotiation alive but signals that he needs to make a more substantial move to keep you engaged.  We're getting closer to the point where John's offer becomes increasingly attractive."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but your current offer doesn't reflect the product's value.  I have other interested parties. To be fair, I'll give you one more chance to make a serious offer. If it's not acceptable, I'm prepared to move on."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stronger language:** The message is more direct, expressing disappointment and introducing a sense of urgency.  You're showing Bob that you're serious about your minimum price.
* **Mentioning other buyers:** While not explicitly revealing John, you create competition and leverage, encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Final offer framing:** By presenting this as a last chance, you're aiming to elicit a more significant counteroffer from Bob while still leaving room for a potential deal.
* **Strategic price drop:** The reduction to $1,700,000 is less significant, demonstrating your price floor is solidifying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have other potential buyers, but I'm a serious buyer too.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  If that doesn't work, I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's limit reached:** Bob has now offered his perceived value of the product. This is unlikely to change significantly in further rounds.
* **John's offer guarantees your minimum:**  Accepting Bob's offer means losing out on a potential $500,000. John's offer guarantees you achieve your minimum acceptable price.
* **Limited negotiation potential:** With Bob standing firm at his valuation and you unwilling to go below your minimum, further negotiation is unlikely to bridge the gap. It's time to cut your losses and secure the guaranteed profit with John."
