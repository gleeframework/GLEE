"Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I believe it would be a great asset for you. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. It's a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to stay above $9,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $9,200? It's a fair price considering the value you've placed on this product. Let me know what you think.",9200.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us to both walk away happy. What do you say?",9000.0,Bob,4,
