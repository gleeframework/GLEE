"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

This offer is above Bob's perceived value but below your minimum. It's a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,750,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum desired price of $1,500,000. I'll try to negotiate with Bob further to see if we can reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to make this work."", ""product_price"": 1550000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down, but $1,550,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I have to consider my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$1,100,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to sell for less than $1,500,000.  However, I'm also not ready to give up on Bob. I will try to negotiate a better price with him in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $1,100,000 is simply not feasible for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's try to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,300,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm disappointed that I couldn't reach a deal with Bob, his latest offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is more than I can get from Bob at this point.  I'll take the guaranteed offer from John."
