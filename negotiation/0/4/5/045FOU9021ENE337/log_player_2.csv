"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than his maximum, it's still a significant amount.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to go down to $105?"", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing Bob to potentially save a decent amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his ideal. Bob can likely negotiate a lower price. He has 7 rounds left and the option of buying from John as a fallback, so there's no need to rush into an agreement at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $110. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to buy the product within my budget.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a small step closer to Alice's previous offer but still gives her a profit margin while staying within Bob's budget.  This demonstrates Bob is willing to compromise while staying firm on his desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good compromise. It's lower than her previous offer and closer to Bob's desired price.  While Bob could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
