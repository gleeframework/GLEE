"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $115?",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $110. It's a fair price for both of us and allows me to buy the product within my budget.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet at $112.50? It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
