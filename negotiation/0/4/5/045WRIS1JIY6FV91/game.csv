"Alice, thank you for the offer. While it's tempting, I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows us both to make a good deal.  Let's close this deal and avoid any further haggling.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price reflects the product's true value.

This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Alice,5,
