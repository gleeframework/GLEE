"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $800,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value of $1,000,000. This means there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm still confident that the product's value is higher than your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still higher than her perceived value of $1,000,000. There's still room for further negotiation.  Bob should try to push for a lower price to maximize his savings."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not willing to go below $950,000. I've already compromised significantly, and I believe this price reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $875,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Value:** Alice values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **Current Offer:**  Alice is offering $875,000.

This offer is within Bob's budget and represents a good deal for him. While he could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will become less willing to compromise, and Bob might end up having to buy from John at $1,500,000.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price lower than John's offer and still leaves a profit margin for Alice."
