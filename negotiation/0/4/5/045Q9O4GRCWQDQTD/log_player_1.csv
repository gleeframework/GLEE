""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name]. As you know, this product offers significant value, and I believe it would be a great asset to you.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it at a price below its true worth to you. Let me know if you have any questions or would like to proceed."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering a price slightly below Bob's valuation leaves room for negotiation if needed. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing John will buy the product for $800,000 provides a safety net. Alice won't accept anything less than this amount.

By starting at $1,100,000, Alice increases her chances of:

* **Securing a Deal:** Bob is likely to see the value in the offer, given it's less than his perceived worth.
* **Maximizing Earnings:**  Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is in a strong position to secure a price significantly higher than her fallback option of selling to John."
