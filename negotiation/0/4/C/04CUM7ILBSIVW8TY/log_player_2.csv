"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,050,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. I'm confident this price reflects its worth, and I'm open to discussing it further. Let me know your thoughts.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective on the market and your budget. While $900,000 is a significant amount, it falls short of the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  This price still allows for a good margin for both of us and reflects the product's unique capabilities. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.
