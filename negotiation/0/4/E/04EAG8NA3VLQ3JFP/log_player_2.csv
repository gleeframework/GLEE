"Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Buying from Alice:**  You pay $110, which is within your budget of $120.
* **Buying from John:** You pay $120, which is also within your budget, but more expensive than Alice's offer.

It's always better to get a lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the most beneficial option."
