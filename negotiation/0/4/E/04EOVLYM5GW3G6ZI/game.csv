"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to its value to you. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product. This gives you a decent profit and leaves room for me to save.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $900,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle and see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we settle on $875,000?  This would be a good compromise, allowing you a solid profit and ensuring I get a good deal. What do you say?",875000.0,Bob,4,
