"Hey Alice, $150 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $110 right now.  What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $110 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $130? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle on $115? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $115 is still a bit below my target, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $125? It's a great price for a fantastic product, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",125.0,Alice,5,
