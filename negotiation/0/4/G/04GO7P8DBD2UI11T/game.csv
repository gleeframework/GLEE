"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we try $108.75?",108.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $108.75 is still a bit out of my budget. Let's go with $107, which is halfway between our last offers.  I think that's a fair compromise.",107.0,Bob,6,
