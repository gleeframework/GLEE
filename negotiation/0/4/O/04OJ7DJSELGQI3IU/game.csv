"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $170 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be comfortable paying $100. Let me know what you think!",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hey Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $130. This still gives me some room to make this worthwhile, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find a middle ground!",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to make a deal. What do you think?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $125? It's a fair price that allows us both to make this work. Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,5,
