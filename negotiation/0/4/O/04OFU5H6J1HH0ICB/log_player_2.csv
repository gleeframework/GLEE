"Alice's offer: The product price will be $200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $150 to Alice, and she's offering it for $200. That's way more than you're willing to pay.  You should reject her offer and counteroffer with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

You're offering Alice $120 for the product. This is a significant discount from her initial offer, but still above your maximum price of $100. You're hoping she'll accept this counteroffer, but you're prepared to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is still asking too much.  While $180 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum price point. You'll reject her offer again and try one more counteroffer before going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

This is a final attempt to reach a compromise with Alice.  You're offering $135, which is a bit more than your initial counteroffer, but still significantly less than her asking price.  If she rejects this, you'll buy the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is still being stubborn and not willing to budge. You've made several counteroffers and have reached a point where you're not willing to go any higher. You've made it clear that you're willing to walk away, and now it's time to follow through.  You'll buy the product from John for $100."
