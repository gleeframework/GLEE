Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This initial offer starts high, reflecting your desire to maximize profit. The friendly message also encourages Bob to engage in negotiation, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still lower than the initial asking price of $150. The goal is to maximize profit. Rejecting the offer allows for a counteroffer, potentially closer to the desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $135? It's a fair compromise and still gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to go down to $125? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $125 is still less than the initial goal, it's only $5 less than the previous counteroffer of $135.  There's a chance Bob might not go any higher, and selling to John for $100 would mean losing a significant amount of potential profit.  Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice to ensure a sale at a reasonable price."
