"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000.  This is a strong opening offer, leaving room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is seriously interested and what his budget might be.  If he rejects this, I'll need to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I'm not ready to settle yet.  I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price.  By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,350,000. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my initial offer. This should also encourage Bob to continue negotiating."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd like to continue negotiating, we're getting close to the end of the rounds.  Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a decent price and significantly better than selling to John.  Accepting this offer ensures I get a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation leading to a lower price or a deal falling through completely."
