"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $10,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for potential negotiation and gives me room to lower the price if necessary. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and how high he is willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $7,000 is above my minimum, I'm not willing to settle just yet. I believe there's potential to get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm counter-offering at $9,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves room for further negotiation. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a reasonable price, considering his initial offer was significantly lower than my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $6,500 is tempting, I'm still not at my desired price point. I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to settle yet. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap between our offers."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm counter-offering at $8,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, but it's still above my minimum price of $8,000 and shows I'm serious about selling to Bob. I believe this price is fair considering our back-and-forth negotiation and the fact that I'm willing to sell to John for $8,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$7,500 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not willing to settle. I believe there's still potential to get a better price. I will counteroffer in the next round, hoping to bridge the gap and close the deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

I'm offering $8,000. This is my minimum price, and I'm willing to accept it. I'm also aware that I can sell to John for the same price. It's time to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only 2 rounds left, I don't have enough time to negotiate further. Bob's offer is only $200 below my minimum, and I'm not sure if I can convince him to go higher. It's better to secure the guaranteed $8,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
