``` 

I'm starting with a price that's slightly lower than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate while still getting a good price.  I'm also being friendly and encouraging a response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

``` 
I'm countering with a price that's still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still trying to get a good price. I'm also framing it as a compromise to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,900.
