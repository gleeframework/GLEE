I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum, hoping to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll be ready to counter."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

$120 is too low for me.  I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."

I'm reducing my price slightly, but still aiming for a profit. Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the profit.  I'll try one more counteroffer."

I'm taking a bigger risk here, but I'm hoping Bob will finally agree to a price closer to what I need. If he rejects, I'll sell to John for $150."

I've reached my limit with Bob.  It's better to sell to John for $150 and avoid further negotiations that might result in a lower price."
