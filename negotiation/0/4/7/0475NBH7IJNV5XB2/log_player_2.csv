"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $7,500 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate.  A $500 reduction is a reasonable starting point, and it signals my interest in buying the product while also showing I'm not afraid to push for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price, and we've only had three rounds.  There's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to push for a lower price.  I'll counter again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7200}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show good faith and signal a willingness to compromise.  This is a more realistic counter-offer than the previous one, and it allows for further negotiation while still keeping the price below my desired limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $7,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $7,650
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I would prefer a lower price, Alice's offer of $7,650 is getting closer to my target.  We are approaching the halfway point in negotiations, and with only 5 rounds left, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers. Accepting this offer will ensure I get the product without going over my budget and still saves me some money compared to buying from John."
