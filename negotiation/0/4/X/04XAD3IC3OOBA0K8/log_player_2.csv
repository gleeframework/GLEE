"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is too high.  It's better to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This still allows for a healthy margin for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is a good deal.  I can save $250,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a fair price and I'm happy to accept."
