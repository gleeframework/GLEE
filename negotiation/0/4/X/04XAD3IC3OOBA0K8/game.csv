"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1500000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1000000 is simply too low for me. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This still allows for a healthy margin for both of us, and hopefully, we can close this deal. What do you think?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
