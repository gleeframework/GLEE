Thanks for the offer Alice!  I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. How about $105?,105.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $108. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",108.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $108 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and go with $106.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal.",106.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $106. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $109. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the value the product brings.",109.0,Alice,5,
