Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I know it's valuable to you, and I'm confident you'll find this a fair price."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000, aiming higher initially allows you to potentially maximize your profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can then decide if you want to meet him somewhere in the middle. 
* **Psychological Pricing:**  A price slightly below a round number like $20,000 can sometimes feel more appealing to buyers.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value. If you had more information, you might adjust your offer accordingly."
