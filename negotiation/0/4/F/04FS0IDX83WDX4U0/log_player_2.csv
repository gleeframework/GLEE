# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","I'm not sure if $9,500 is a good deal, considering the product is worth $8,000 to Alice. I'd like to try to negotiate a better price. 

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to negotiate a better price. Since Alice is willing to sell the product for $8,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's lower than that.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget."", ""product_price"": 7000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $7000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $8500. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my minimum price. Let's see if we can find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","Alice's new offer of $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay, but it's getting closer to the price I'm comfortable with. I'll try to negotiate a bit further.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","I'll try to meet Alice halfway between $8,000 and $8,500.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $8,250? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 8250}"
