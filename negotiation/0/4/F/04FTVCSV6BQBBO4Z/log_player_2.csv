Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  It's likely that further negotiation will not yield a significantly better price. Buying from Alice at this price is a good compromise, saving Bob $75,000 compared to buying from John."
