"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $11,000 is quite low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $12,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident it's a price we can both be happy with.",12500.0,Bob,4,
