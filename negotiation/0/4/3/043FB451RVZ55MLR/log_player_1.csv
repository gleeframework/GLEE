Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I'm hoping it will entice Bob to negotiate. If he rejects, I'll have to gauge his interest and adjust accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept, it's still worth trying to push for a better deal. I'll reject his offer and see if I can negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm countering Bob's offer with $1,200,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than his. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm not sure he's willing to go any higher. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
