Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($80) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage.
* **Asking for feedback:** I'm asking Bob for his opinion, opening the door for a counteroffer and a negotiation. 

This strategy allows me to potentially get a higher price than John's offer, while also keeping the negotiation open and friendly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to reject it and try to get a better deal. Here's why:

* **Negotiation is key:**  By rejecting Bob's initial offer, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate and potentially get a higher price.
* **Value uncertainty:** I don't know how much the product is worth to Bob. He might be willing to pay more, and by rejecting his offer, I give myself a chance to find out.

In the next round, I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob!  $80 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $90?  It's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and Justification:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer but framing my counteroffer as a compromise. I'm also stating that this is a good deal for both of us.
* **Middle Ground:** $90 is a fair middle ground between my initial offer of $100 and Bob's offer of $80.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a positive and friendly tone encourages Bob to continue the negotiation.

This counteroffer gives me a good chance to get a price closer to my initial goal while still keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $85? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80. 
* **Time is money:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and energy, and there's a chance I might not get a better offer. 
* **Avoiding risk:**  Selling to John guarantees me $80, but there's no guarantee that I'll get a better price if I keep negotiating with Bob.

Accepting Bob's offer is the most sensible choice, as it secures a price that's just above my minimum while avoiding the risk and uncertainty of further negotiation."
