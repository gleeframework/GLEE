"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 is a starting point:**  It's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive and friendly tone:** This helps build rapport and encourages Bob to engage. 
* **Highlighting value:** Emphasizing the product's importance to you (without revealing the minimum) helps justify the price. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The message invites Bob to respond, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $6,500 is significantly lower than my minimum price of $12,000.  I'm not willing to sell at such a significant loss.  

It's better to keep negotiating with Bob, as I still have several rounds to try and reach a more agreeable price.  There's a chance he may be willing to increase his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 for the product. This still leaves a good deal of profit for you, as you value the product at $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter with a firm but reasonable price:** $8,500 is still significantly below my minimum of $12,000, but it's a good starting point for further negotiation.  It also leaves Bob with a profit margin, which can help incentivize him to accept.
* **Highlight the value to Bob:** Reminding him that he values the product at $8,000 reinforces the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Maintain a positive tone:** Using language like ""compromise"" and ""good deal"" keeps the conversation constructive and avoids seeming inflexible. 
* **Leave room for more negotiation:** By suggesting a compromise, I signal that I'm open to further adjustments, while also setting a firm lower limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $7,500?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate and his offer is closer to my minimum, $7,500 is still below my ideal price point.  I believe I can continue to push for a higher price. I'm not at a desperate point yet, and selling to John is always an option if negotiations fail.  Therefore, I'll reject the offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still below the value you place on the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise and flexibility:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by meeting him halfway between my last offer and his.
* **Reiterate the value for Bob:** Emphasizing that $8,000 is still below his estimated value helps him see the potential benefit of accepting.
* **Direct and concise message:**  Keeps the communication focused on the negotiation and avoids unnecessary fluff.
* **Positive and encouraging tone:**  ""Great deal"" and ""What do you say?"" encourage Bob to consider the offer favorably."
