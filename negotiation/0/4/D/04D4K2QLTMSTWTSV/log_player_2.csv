"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. I should try to negotiate a lower price closer to my budget."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $6,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need at least $8,500 for the product. This still leaves a good deal of profit for you, as you value the product at $8,000.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice is coming closer to my budget, I know I can get the product for $8,000 from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit more before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could we possibly meet in the middle at $7,500? "",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $7,500 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to go down to $8,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's still below the value you place on the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to my exact alternative price. There's no point in negotiating further or going with John, as it's the best possible outcome."
