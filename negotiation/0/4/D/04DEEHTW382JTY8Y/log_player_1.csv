Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high.  A price of $1,200,000 aims to significantly increase your potential profit.
* **Sense of urgency and exclusivity:**  Mentioning other interested parties and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and might encourage Bob to act quickly.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While the initial price is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows you to gauge his interest and potentially settle on a price higher than your minimum.

**Important Note:** This strategy involves some risk. If Bob is turned off by the high price and refuses to negotiate, you will have to sell to John at your minimum price. However, the potential for a significantly higher profit makes this a calculated risk worth taking."
