"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. I'm willing to sell you this exceptional product for $9,500. It's a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $10,000. There's a chance you could get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer and seeing if she's willing to go lower."
