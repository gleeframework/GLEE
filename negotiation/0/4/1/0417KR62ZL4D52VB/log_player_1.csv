Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  $90 is still a bit low for me, and I think I can get a better price if I counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  How about $92? That's only $2 more than your offer, and I think it's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $92. I'd be willing to pay $87 for the product. That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $87 is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my target price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're sticking to your price point, but I'm not quite there yet. Let's split the difference - I'll accept $89 for the product. That's only $2 more than your offer."", ""product_price"": 89}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $89. I'd be willing to pay $84 for the product. That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $84
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $84 is below my minimum price, and I've already made several counteroffers. It's not worth risking a further decline in price or spending more time negotiating.  Selling to John for $80 is a secure way to get a reasonable price without further negotiation."
