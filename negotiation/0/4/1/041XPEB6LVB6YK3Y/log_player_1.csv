Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me right now. Would you consider lowering the price? I was thinking something closer to $10,000 would be more reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $11,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to get a slightly better price. How about we split the difference between your offer and my previous one, and settle on $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750.
