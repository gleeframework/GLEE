{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is way too high.** It's well above your maximum budget of $10,000.
* **There's no reason to accept it.**  You have other options.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** This opens the door for you to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Start low:**  I'm going to immediately offer my maximum price, $10,000. This establishes my firm limit and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Force Alice to decide:** This forces Alice to either accept my offer (which is ideal) or counter with a higher price, giving us an opportunity to compromise."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above my budget.
* **There's still room for negotiation.** I'm willing to pay more than John's price, so I'll try to negotiate with Alice further.
* **Rejection sets up another counteroffer.** This gives me another chance to get closer to a price I'm comfortable with."

* **Finding middle ground:** This offer is in the middle between my initial offer and Alice's latest offer, signaling a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Pressure on Alice:** This puts pressure on Alice to consider accepting, as the gap between our offers is narrowing."
