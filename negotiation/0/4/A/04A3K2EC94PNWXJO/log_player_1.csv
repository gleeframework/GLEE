"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This sets the stage for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level.  I'm confident in selling to John for $15,000, so I have room to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. It's far too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm not willing to sell for $10,000, but I'm also not ready to give up on Bob as a buyer. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $16,000.  This shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintaining a price that is closer to my value of the product.  I'm hoping that this will entice him to accept the offer, while still allowing me to make a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied. I believe we can bridge the gap further. I'm not ready to give up on Bob, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, this time dropping to $14,000.  I'm getting closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a profit margin. I'm hoping this will be a good compromise, and that Bob will finally accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough call, but $13,000 is only $2,000 less than what John is willing to pay. I'm not willing to risk another round with Bob and potentially lose more money, especially since I'm getting closer to my minimum. I'll accept Bob's offer."
