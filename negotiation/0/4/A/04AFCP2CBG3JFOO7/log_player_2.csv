"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $13,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm aiming for something closer to $13,750. It represents a fair deal considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $13,750 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his ideal price of $13,000.  Continuing to negotiate might get the price lower, but it also risks Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting the offer is the most logical choice, balancing potential savings with the risk of losing the deal."
