"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable piece, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high.  It's in my best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, so I have time to see if we can come to a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value and my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's try to meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget. Let's close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but her offer is still above my target. I can try to negotiate a lower price. While John offers a fixed price of $1,000,000, I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less. I have 7 rounds left, and it's worth trying to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product and our respective positions. Let's work together to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer of $950,000, but I'm still a little ways from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is my absolute bottom line. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our previous discussions. Let's close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has finally reached my target price of $1,000,000. While I could continue negotiating, there's no guarantee I'll get a lower price.  It's also a good price considering the value of the product and the time I've already spent negotiating. Accepting the offer saves me time and ensures I get the product within my budget."
