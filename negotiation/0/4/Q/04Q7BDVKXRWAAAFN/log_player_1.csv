Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,250,000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I need to close the deal,  $1,250,000 is too far below my minimum. I'll try to negotiate a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a good price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I still believe the product is worth less than $1,600,000 to me. My counteroffer is $1,500,000. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is the same as what I can get from John. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids the risk of losing out on the deal entirely. I'll accept Bob's offer."
