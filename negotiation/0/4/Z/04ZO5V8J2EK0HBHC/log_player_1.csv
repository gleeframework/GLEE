Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly beneficial for you.  I'm willing to make a deal at $1,400,000. This offer stands until [date/time], after which it will no longer be available."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit:** While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, we want to see if Bob will pay a higher price.
* **Strategic pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a significant profit margin for Alice (almost 30% above Bob's valuation) while still leaving Bob with a potential $400,000 gain if he utilizes the product effectively. 
* **Time pressure:**  Adding a deadline creates urgency and might encourage Bob to accept the offer quickly. 

This approach balances risk and reward. If Bob accepts, Alice earns more than John's offer. If Bob rejects, Alice still has her guaranteed sale."
