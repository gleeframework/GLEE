"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a decent deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price in the subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than what he'd pay to John. Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can get a better deal. It's possible Alice will come down further, or Bob might be able to find a sweet spot in his counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a reasonable profit. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
