"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While $1,100,000 is below Bob's maximum, there's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price.
* **John's offer is a backup:**  Bob has the option to go to John, but it's better to try and get a better price from Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but I'm looking to pay closer to $950,000.  This product is valuable to me, but it needs to be within my budget."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counter:** Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to quickly establish a lower price point.  This sets the stage for negotiation.
* **Justification:** Bob provides a reason for the lower price, highlighting the product's value to him while emphasizing his budget constraints.
* **Room for Compromise:**  $950,000 is still a decent profit for Alice, leaving room for negotiation throughout the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** While $1,050,000 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation, and Bob wants to get the best deal possible. 
* **Potential for a lower price:**  By rejecting, Bob can continue to push for a lower price in subsequent rounds.
* **John's offer remains a backup:** If negotiations with Alice fail, Bob can always fall back on John's offer, but he wants to exhaust all options with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my comfort zone.  I'm prepared to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This is a fair price, and it allows us both to achieve a good outcome."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** Bob moves closer to Alice's desired price, demonstrating his willingness to compromise while still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Emphasize Fairness:** Bob emphasizes that his offer is a ""fair price,"" appealing to Alice's sense of reason and potentially softening her stance.
* **Mutual Benefit:** Bob highlights the mutual benefit of a successful deal, potentially influencing Alice to be more agreeable."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not willing to sell the product to you for $1,000,000, as it's below my minimum value. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,080,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:** $1,080,000 is very close to Bob's target price of $1,000,000.  
* **Limited Time:** With only 5 rounds left, the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice is increasing.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is still a backup, it's getting closer to being a more attractive option with each passing round.

**Decision:** Accepting Alice's offer at $1,080,000 is the best choice in this round. It achieves a favorable price for Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the deal and having to go with John's higher price."
