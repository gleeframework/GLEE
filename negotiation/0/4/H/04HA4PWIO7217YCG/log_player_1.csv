"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth it to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your product, but I believe we can come to a better agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $15,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further and see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $15,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,500? I'm confident this is still a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $15,000 as a compromise. This would be a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is consistently offering $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm also aware that John is willing to pay $15,000.  Since I'm not gaining anything by continuing to negotiate with Bob, it's best to sell the product to John and secure the guaranteed price."
