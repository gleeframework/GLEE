{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin above my minimum value while also being a potentially attractive price to Bob.  I'll need to see how he responds to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  It's far below my minimum value of $12,000.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is my minimum value and still a good deal for Bob considering he offered significantly less. If he's genuinely interested, I believe he'll accept this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low for me.  I'm not willing to go below my minimum value, and I've already spent a couple of rounds trying to negotiate.  At this point, it's better to sell to John and guarantee a fair price."
