**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,100,000, which is less than the $1,200,000 John is asking.
* **You're still saving money:** Even though Alice's offer is above her value ($800,000), it's still below your maximum value ($1,200,000). This means you're getting a good deal and saving money."
