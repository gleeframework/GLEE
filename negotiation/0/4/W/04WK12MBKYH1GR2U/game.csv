"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $160? I believe we could reach a fair agreement.",160.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not comfortable going down to $160. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $170. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I think it's a great compromise. Let me know if this works for you.",170.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $165 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $172. I'm willing to give you a small discount, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I think $172 is a great compromise, considering the value it brings. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",172.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your response, Alice. I understand your position and I am willing to consider your offer at $172. However, I am still hoping to stay within my budget. Could we perhaps find a middle ground at $168? This would allow me to purchase the product without exceeding my budget while also respecting the value you place on it.",168.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $168 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $175, which is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings. Let me know if this is something you're comfortable with.",175.0,Alice,7,
