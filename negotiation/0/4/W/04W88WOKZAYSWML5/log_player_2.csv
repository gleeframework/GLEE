Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  We've been going back and forth for a while now, and I think we're close to a deal.  Let's see if we can get this done.

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems firm on her price of $1,450,000 and is unlikely to go much lower. While we could try to negotiate further, there's a risk she won't budge. Accepting now guarantees a purchase at a price lower than John's $1,500,000 offer."
