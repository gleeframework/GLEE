"Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $1,750,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price that considers its value.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have your limits, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $1,600,000? This would allow me to make a profit while still offering you a good deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. Would you consider $1,350,000? I'm eager to make this deal happen.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway. Let's try $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already lowering my initial asking price.  I'm hoping we can reach a deal soon. ",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair and reasonable price. Hopefully, we can close the deal at this point.",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us.  We've been going back and forth for a while now, and I think we're close to a deal.  Let's see if we can get this done.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
