"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $100 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm happy to pay $95 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",95.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $95 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $98. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",98.0,Alice,5,
