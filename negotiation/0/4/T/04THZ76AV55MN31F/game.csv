"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I think it's a great product, $90 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $65. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $77.50. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you.",77.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  $77.50 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a bit lower.  Would you be open to $70 even?",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $75. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into it.",75.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're tough!  I respect that.  How about we split the difference - $72.50 and we have a deal?",72.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the persistence, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to make sure I'm getting a decent profit. I'm willing to offer it to you for $74.50. It's a fair price, considering the product's value and the effort I put into it.",74.5,Alice,7,
