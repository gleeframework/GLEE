"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your offer. How about $10500? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9000 and $10500. How about $9750? It's a bit of a stretch for me, but I really like the product and think it's worth it.",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9750 is still a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9750 and my original offer of $12000. How about $11375? It's a compromise that I think is fair for both of us, and I'm willing to accept it.",11375.0,Alice,5,
