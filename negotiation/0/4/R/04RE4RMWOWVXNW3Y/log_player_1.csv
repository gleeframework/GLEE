"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $8,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also includes a friendly message to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below your minimum price of $8,000. You can likely negotiate a better price.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer in the next round is the best strategy to maximize your earnings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $7,500 is below what I need, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $8,250?  That's still a good price for you, and it's closer to my minimum."", ""product_price"": 8250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below what you need to make a good profit. Rejecting his offer and counteroffering again in the next round is the best option to try and close the deal at a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. However, $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $7,800, but that's my final offer.  I believe this is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 7800}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $7800, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $7500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is insistent on a lower price, and you've already made significant concessions.  It's becoming clear that you're unlikely to get your desired price from Bob.  Selling to John for $8,000 ensures you meet your minimum requirement and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
