"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $9,500.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest.  While $9,500 is below my desired price, I'm willing to come down to $10,200.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair price for both of us.  Let's make this happen!",10200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,200 is still a little higher than I'd like to go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $10,000?  That would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",10000.0,Bob,4,
