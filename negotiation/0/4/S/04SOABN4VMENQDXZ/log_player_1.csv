{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable, for $130. It's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $100.
* **John's Offer:**  You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $130, you are:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Aiming for a price closer to Bob's maximum valuation.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Bob might try to negotiate the price down, and you have some buffer before hitting your minimum.
* **Ensuring a Sale:** The price is significantly more attractive than Bob simply walking away, giving you a high chance of securing the sale."
