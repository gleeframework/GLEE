,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of this product,  $1,500,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $1,100,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider a price of $1,350,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
