"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You can get the product for a lower price from John ($1,500,000) than Alice's current offer ($1,200,000).
*  There's room to negotiate with Alice and potentially get a better price. Rejecting the offer allows for that negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still above her minimum price.
* This gives Alice room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a significant amount of money. 
* I'm confident I can negotiate further down if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is lower than John's offer of $1,500,000.
*  While there might be potential to negotiate further with Alice, the risk of her rejecting further offers and potentially going back to $1,200,000 or higher makes accepting her current offer the most logical choice.
* It's a good price and saves a significant amount compared to buying from John."
