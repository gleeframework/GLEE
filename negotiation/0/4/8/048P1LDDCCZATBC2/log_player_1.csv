Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $115 is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value of $100, giving you some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** $115 is still above your minimum of $120, so you're not losing money. 
* **It's a reasonable opening offer:** It's not overly aggressive, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $115 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is far below my minimum of $120.  I can't accept that offer and still meet my goals. I'll counteroffer to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $90 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $105. This is still a good deal for you, as it's below my asking price and gives you a good value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
