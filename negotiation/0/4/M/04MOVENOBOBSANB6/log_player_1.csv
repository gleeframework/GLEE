Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly beneficial for you, given its potential value. I'm asking for $900,000, which reflects its true worth. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000). 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $900,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have a safety net with John, ensuring you won't be forced to accept an offer below $800,000.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while acknowledging his potential gain and maintaining a fallback option."
