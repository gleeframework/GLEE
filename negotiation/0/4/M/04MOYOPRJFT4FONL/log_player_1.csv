Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you're subtly reminding Bob of its worth without explicitly stating your minimum.
* **Open Communication:**  Phrases like ""initially proposing"" and ""What are your thoughts?"" encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process and potentially counter-offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob finds the price too high.
* Assess Bob's reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly. If he seems completely turned off by the price, you might need to significantly lower it in a follow-up offer."
