"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to let it go for $20,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $20,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Realistic:**  Bob starts by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where a deal is possible. This shows Bob is serious about negotiating and willing to walk away. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  Offering $14,000 leaves some room for Alice to counter without feeling like she's losing too much. This keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Building Rapport:**  Bob's message is friendly and polite, which helps maintain a positive tone during the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $14,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:**  Alice's counteroffer of $17,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $15,000. While it's a step in the right direction, there's still room for negotiation.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting the offer keeps Bob in a strong position.  Alice is showing a willingness to compromise, which makes it likely she will accept a lower price in the next round.
* **Avoiding a ""Good Enough"" Deal:**  It's important to avoid settling too quickly.  There's a good chance Bob can get the product for closer to his ideal price if he continues negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17,000 is still a bit too much for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $16,000?  I'm serious about wanting this product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:**  Bob is offering to meet Alice halfway, showing a willingness to negotiate and find a solution. 
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Bob reinforces the idea that he values the product and wants to make a deal. This helps Alice see the benefit of closing the deal.
* **Building Toward Finality:**  $16,000 is relatively close to Bob's maximum budget, so it indicates he is getting close to his limit. This can encourage Alice to accept the offer."
