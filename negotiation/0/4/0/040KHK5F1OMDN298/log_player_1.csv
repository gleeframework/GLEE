{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it'd be a great fit for you. I'm offering it for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price point that is above your minimum but leaves room for negotiation if Bob feels the price is too high. It's important to be polite and friendly while being firm on your starting price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to keep the price closer to my budget. Would you be open to selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

While Bob's offer is your minimum price, you can still try to get a better deal. You'll counteroffer with a price closer to your original asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest!  While $100 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $115. This still leaves some room for both of us to feel good about the transaction.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
