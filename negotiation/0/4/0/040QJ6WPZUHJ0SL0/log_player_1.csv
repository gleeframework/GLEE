Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the value I can derive from the product.

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we still have room to negotiate and try to secure a higher price. We're not desperate to sell below our minimum yet."

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer is now above our guaranteed sale price with John. While we could try to push for more, there's a risk Bob will walk away. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the potential loss of losing both buyers."
