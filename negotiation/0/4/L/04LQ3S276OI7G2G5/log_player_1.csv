"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $145. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also including a friendly message to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $145 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to accept it yet. I'll try to get a bit closer to my desired price by countering in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $137.50? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 137.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $130.  If you're not willing to accept that, I might have to go with another option. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob seems unwilling to budge much further.  While I could continue negotiating,  I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds and risk getting stuck with a lower price. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum desired price, so that's the best option at this point."
