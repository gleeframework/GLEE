"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that we believe would greatly benefit you. Considering its value and quality, we're willing to offer it to you for $100. We hope this price aligns with your expectations and allows us to make a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  $100 is still above Bob's maximum willingness to pay.
* **There are more rounds.**  Bob has time to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting low:**  Bob is aiming for a significant discount, starting with a price close to Alice's minimum.
* **Reasonable offer:**  $85 is still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  The message is polite and shows interest in the product, but emphasizes Bob's budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and respect your valuation of the product. In order to reach a compromise, I am willing to lower the price to $90. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while making the product accessible to you. Please let me know if this revised offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above Bob's maximum:** $90 is still higher than Bob's $80 valuation. 
* **Room for further negotiation:**  Alice is already showing flexibility.  There's a good chance she might come down further if Bob continues to counteroffer.
* **Jhon is an option:**  While Bob wants to save as much as possible, he has a backup option with Jhon.  This gives him more leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $90 is still a little high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $87.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can move forward with the sale."", ""product_price"": 87.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate Counter:**  This offer is in the middle of Alice's previous offer and Bob's last counteroffer.  It shows a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a lower price.
* **Focus on Fairness:**  The message emphasizes a ""fair price"" for both parties.  This helps to build rapport and increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Specific Price:**  Providing a specific price avoids lengthy back-and-forth and keeps the negotiation moving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your patience and for suggesting $87.5. I appreciate your effort to find a fair price. Considering the value of the product and our costs, I'm willing to agree on $88. This price allows us to cover our expenses while still being competitive in the market. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Bob's valuation:**  $88 is very close to Bob's maximum willingness to pay of $80.
* **Small difference:**  The difference between Alice's offer and Bob's desired price is only $8. 
* **Time is running out:**  With only 5 rounds left, it's getting riskier to keep rejecting offers.  Bob might not get a better deal.
* **Jhon is an option:**  Even though Bob can buy from Jhon, it's better to get the product for $88 if possible. 

While Bob might prefer to push for $85, it's more strategic to accept this offer and secure the product for a price that's very close to his limit.  There's always a chance that Alice might not come down further, and Bob could end up paying $120 to Jhon."
