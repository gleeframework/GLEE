Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can benefit you greatly.  I'm asking for $1,199,000, as I know how impactful it can be. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1199000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit with Bob:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000, there's potential to get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below John's offer ($1,199,000) makes it very tempting for Bob.  It highlights a ""deal"" since Bob values it at $1,000,000.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes value and confidence in the product, encouraging Bob to accept. 

This approach aims to secure the highest possible price while maintaining a good chance of Bob accepting the offer."
