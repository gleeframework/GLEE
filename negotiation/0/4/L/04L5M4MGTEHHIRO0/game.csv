"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $1400000 is a significant amount, I believe the product's value justifies a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1600000. This reflects a substantial discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're willing to accept this price.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but $1300000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1500000 as a final offer. If you're serious about this purchase, I believe this is a price that represents a good value for both of us. Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
