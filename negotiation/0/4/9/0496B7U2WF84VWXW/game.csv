"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,300,000. This is a great value considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me right now.  Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a discounted rate.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
