"Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $11000 is still a bit low for me, considering the value of the item. To show my commitment to working with you, I'm willing to go down to $11500.  This price is fair, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. Let's close this deal!",11500.0,Alice,5,
