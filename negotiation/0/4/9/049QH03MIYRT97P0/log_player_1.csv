"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a relatively high offer of $15,000. This allows for room to negotiate and also shows Bob that I value the product. Since I don't know his value, I'm aiming for a high starting point hoping to get a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,000 is significantly lower than my minimum value of $12,000. I will reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering Bob my minimum price of $12,000. This shows him I'm serious about selling, but I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still not comfortable accepting it. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to try and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000} 
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly to $11,000. This shows flexibility while still holding a position above my minimum value. It might be enough to entice Bob to accept, but I'm still prepared to potentially reject his next counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting it.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer to $10,500. This is still above my minimum value, but it shows Bob that I am willing to negotiate and find a middle ground. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to accept, but I'm prepared to make a final counteroffer if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only two rounds left, the negotiations have stalled, and Bob's offers are still below my minimum. While $9,750 is close, it's not worth risking the last two rounds for a slightly better price.  Selling to John at $12,000 guarantees a profitable sale and secures my minimum value."
