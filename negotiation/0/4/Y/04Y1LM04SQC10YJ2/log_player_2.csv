"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $140. I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

``` 

You can try to get a better deal from Alice. You can afford to pay up to $150, and Alice is willing to sell for $120, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I can do $135, but I was thinking more along the lines of $137. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137

Alice's offer of $137 is within your budget and is closer to your target price than John's offer.  It's a good deal for you, and you should accept it."
