"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is still quite high considering the product is only worth $800,000 to her.  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible, so I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Given your value for the product and my budget, I'm willing to pay $750,000.  This leaves room for both of us to make a profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement!"", ""product_price"": 750000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $850,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to earn a significant profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still more than what the product is worth to her ($800,000). While it's a better price than her initial offer, I (Bob) can still try to negotiate a lower price.  There are still many rounds remaining, and I'm confident I can get a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer you $825,000. This would be a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $825,000 is still a bit lower than my target price. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you a price of $875,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down in her price, but $875,000 is still too high for me.  I'm confident we can reach a more agreeable price with further negotiation.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'll offer you a price of $880,000. This is still a good compromise considering the product's value to you and my minimum acceptable price. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $880,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $880,000 is still above what the product is worth to her, but it's getting close to my limit.  I'm running out of time and negotiation rounds, and it's becoming more likely that I'll have to buy from John at a much higher price.  This is a good deal considering the value to me and the remaining rounds. I'll accept the offer and move on."
