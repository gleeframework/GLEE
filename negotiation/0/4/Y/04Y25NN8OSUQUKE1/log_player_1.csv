Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Starting Point:** Starting at $12,000 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It also establishes a perceived high value.
* **Alternative Buyer Leverage:** While you don't want to reveal John's offer, implying you have other options can subtly encourage Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob, but don't go below your minimum of $10,000."
