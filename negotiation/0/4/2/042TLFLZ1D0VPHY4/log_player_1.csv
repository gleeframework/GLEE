"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to begin negotiations with an offer above your desired selling price. This provides room for negotiation and allows you to potentially gauge Bob's interest level.
* **Justification:**  Phrasing the offer as ""fair"" and highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's worth at a higher level. 
* **Leaving Room:**  While the initial price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves ample space for negotiation over the subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price given the potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is above his perceived value of the product, which is a positive sign. However, it's still significantly below both your minimum and your initial offer.  You have room to negotiate and should try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for presenting your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This takes into account the unique value this product offers."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conciliatory Tone:** Acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and showing understanding helps maintain a positive negotiation atmosphere.
* **Significant Drop:**  Decreasing the price by $150,000 signals flexibility and a willingness to negotiate. However, the drop is calculated; it remains well above both Bob's offer and his perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:** Re-emphasize the product's unique value to justify the higher price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given the potential of the product and my willingness to buy it from you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We are getting closer. Bob is now above his perceived value and getting closer to John's offer. There is still room to negotiate for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I've tried to be flexible, and to meet you halfway, I could come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  Introducing this offer as ""final"" increases the pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Small Concession:** A $100,000 reduction shows movement but holds firm above the $1,000,000 alternative offer from John.
* **Justification:** Highlighting your flexibility throughout the negotiation helps frame the offer as reasonable. 

**Important:**  If Bob rejects this offer, it's highly advisable to accept John's offer of $1,000,000.  The risk of Bob walking away and the diminishing returns of further negotiation make it strategically sound to secure the guaranteed amount."
