"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, which I believe is a fair price given the potential value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider this offer and for presenting your counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. To move this forward, I could consider $1,150,000. This takes into account the unique value this product offers.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in this product, but $1,150,000 is still too high for me. Let's meet in the middle at $950,000. I believe this is a fair price given the potential of the product and my willingness to buy it from you.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise.  I've tried to be flexible, and to meet you halfway, I could come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
