Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations above your desired price. This leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to bring the price down.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial offer is intentionally high to gauge Bob's reaction. If he outright rejects it, we know he's serious about negotiating. If he counters with a reasonable offer, it suggests he's genuinely interested. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer for $1,000,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We can afford to be more assertive in our negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $900,000 is a significant jump from our initial ask but still below our minimum acceptable price. By rejecting his offer, we signal that we're serious about the product's value while giving us an opportunity to negotiate further and potentially meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product brings is truly significant. To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,150,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:**  We reduced our price by $150,000, which is a substantial move designed to show Bob we're willing to negotiate.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  Our new price of $1,150,000 is still comfortably above our $1,000,000 minimum and leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Justification:**  We're reinforcing the product's value to justify the higher price and avoid appearing overly eager to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be open to considering a price of $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his latest offer of $950,000 is still below our absolute minimum of $1,000,000.  Continuing to negotiate with him carries the risk of:

* **Setting a precedent:** Accepting an offer significantly below our target might encourage Bob to push for even lower prices.
* **Wasting time and effort:** Further negotiation rounds might not lead to a mutually agreeable price.

Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees we meet our minimum price and avoids potential negotiation fatigue."
