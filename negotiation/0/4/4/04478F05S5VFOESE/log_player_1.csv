"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit.  I'm hoping Bob will be motivated to negotiate, but I'm also prepared to walk away and sell to John if the negotiations don't go my way."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum value of $800,000. I'll counter with a higher offer, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if I don't see a good deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more attractive to Bob, but I'm still prepared to walk away if necessary."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, I'm not ready to accept yet. I'll counter again, but I'm also prepared to sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm making another slight concession, but I'm still holding firm on my desired profit margin. If Bob rejects this offer, I'm seriously considering selling to John."

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offers are still not meeting my minimum value. I'm getting frustrated with the negotiation, and I'm concerned that I might not be able to get a better offer.  To guarantee I make at least my minimum value, I'm going to sell to John."
