"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that holds immense value, and I believe it could be a game-changer for you.  While I can't disclose the specific details at this moment, I can assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a price I'm confident is fair, considering the potential benefits this product offers. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While she claims the product is worth more to her, that doesn't change your own value assessment.  It's better to reject her offer and buy from John, saving yourself $600,000."
