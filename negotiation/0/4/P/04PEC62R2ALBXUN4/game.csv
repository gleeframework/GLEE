"Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? ",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway at $11,500?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I can come down to $10,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",10500.0,Alice,5,
