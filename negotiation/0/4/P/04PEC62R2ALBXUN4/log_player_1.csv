Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","Bob's offer is significantly below my minimum, and accepting it would represent a substantial loss. While I'm motivated to sell, I believe there's room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway at $11,500?"", ""product_price"": 11500}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we meet at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,750.  What do you think?
