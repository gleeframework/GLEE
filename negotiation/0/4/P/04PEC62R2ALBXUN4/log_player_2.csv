"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and features, I believe a price of $15,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $15,000 is way over his budget. He can try to negotiate with Alice or buy from John as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is closer to $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price? "", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet halfway at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his budget, he can still try to negotiate a lower price. He can also always go with John's offer of $8,000 if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,500 is still a bit outside my comfort zone. How about we meet at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. I can come down to $10,500. This offer reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is tempting, he's still not at his desired price point. He can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John for $8,000."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $10,500 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $9,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $9,750.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9750}
