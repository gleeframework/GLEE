"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. While $10,000 is a good price, it's still early in the negotiation. Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer. There's also the possibility that Alice might lower her price to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $10,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. Offering $8,500 is a bold move, but it demonstrates Bob's serious interest in the product while still leaving room for negotiation. This counteroffer puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or come back with a lower counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest. While I'm willing to negotiate, $8500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for. How about we split the difference and go with $9250? I believe this price still offers you great value, and it's closer to my desired range. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his ideal price, he can still try to negotiate further.  Alice has already shown a willingness to compromise, and Bob may be able to get her down even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's try $9000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still allowing me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his strategy of slowly chipping away at Alice's price. He's shown he's serious about buying the product, but not at a price that's too far outside his comfort zone.  This counteroffer is a small step down from Alice's latest proposal, giving her an opportunity to accept or negotiate further."
