"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1200000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
