"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1500000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $1,200,000 to him, and Alice's offer is significantly higher. He should try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1000000 is a significant discount from my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price that's closer to the middle ground. How about $1200000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. There's no point in trying to negotiate further, as John also offers the same price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best choice."
