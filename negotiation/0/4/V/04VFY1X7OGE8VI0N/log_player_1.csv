I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers. It's important to remember that I have a safety net of $1,500,000 with John, so I can afford to be a little aggressive in my initial asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm rejecting his offer and will counter with a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,750,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but still well above Bob's offer.  I'm hoping this will be a more palatable price point for Bob while still allowing me to earn a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low.  While I'm starting to get impatient, I'm going to reject his offer again and counter with a higher price.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,250,000.  This is a substantial reduction from my previous offer, but I'm still aiming for a profit significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value.  I'm hoping this price will finally be closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  However, if he rejects this offer, I'll be considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offers are consistently too low, and I'm starting to run out of patience.  It's clear that we're not going to be able to agree on a price that's acceptable to both of us.  To ensure I get a reasonable price, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
