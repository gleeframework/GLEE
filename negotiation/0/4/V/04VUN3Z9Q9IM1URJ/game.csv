"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiations at a price of $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for this product. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value and my budget constraints.  Let's work together to close this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're still in negotiations, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic product at a price that's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,
