"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something I've carefully developed, and I know it can significantly benefit your operations. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000. This price reflects the value I've placed on the product and provides you with a solid opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* However, you know you have another option with John.
* There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price to avoid losing the sale. By rejecting her initial offer, you give yourself room to negotiate a better deal."
