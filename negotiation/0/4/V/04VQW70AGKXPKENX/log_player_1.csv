Explanation:  While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, the negotiations are progressing slowly.  It's unlikely he'll meet the $1,000,000 mark I need to make this worthwhile. John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which is a significant amount more than Bob is currently offering. It makes more financial sense to take the guaranteed profit now."
