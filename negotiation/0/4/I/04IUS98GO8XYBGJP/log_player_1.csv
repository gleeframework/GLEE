Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $18,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($12,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging message to create a good rapport with Bob.
* **Value Proposition:** While I don't know the product's value to Bob, I'm suggesting it's a ""great fit"" to pique his interest.

**Why this strategy:**

* **Maximizes potential profit:** Starting high gives me the best chance to secure a higher selling price.
* **Negotiation space:**  It allows for room to lower the price if Bob counteroffers.
* **Prevents immediate deal with John:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can still negotiate with him before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $18000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $15000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $15,000 is better than my minimum, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm rejecting Bob's offer and will attempt to counteroffer to see if I can secure a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit high, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price. Would you be willing to consider $16,500? This price reflects the product's value and allows for some room for us to both be happy with the deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm offering $16,500, which is a compromise between my original offer and Bob's counteroffer.
* **Reasoning:** I'm providing a reason for my counteroffer, highlighting the value of the product and seeking a mutually agreeable price.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and positive tone to maintain a good relationship with Bob.

**Strategy:**

By counteroffering, I'm showing flexibility while still aiming for a better price than Bob's initial offer.  This keeps the negotiation moving and helps us work towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but $16500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14000? I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer is just $2,000 below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  Continuing to negotiate risks further lowering the price. 
* **Risk of losing the deal:** Bob might walk away entirely if I reject his offer again.

By accepting Bob's offer, I secure a sale that is relatively close to my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the deal altogether.  It's important to weigh the potential gains against the risk of losing the deal. In this case, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic choice."
