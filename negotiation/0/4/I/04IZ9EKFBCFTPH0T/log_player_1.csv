Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $150 is a bit higher than I'm looking to spend right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $120?  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get closer to my initial offer of $150."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'd be willing to come down to $135. This still gives me some wiggle room while hopefully being more appealing to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $135 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $130? I'm really looking to close this deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While $130 isn't my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and a good deal. I'm happy to close the deal today."
