"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise between our positions.",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go to $13,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying hard to make a deal work with you.  I can go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering the current market.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal work, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. Let's try $13,250. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",13250.0,Alice,7,
