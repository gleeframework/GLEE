"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It's much more than I'm willing to pay and significantly above John's offer.  I'll make a counteroffer to see if we can negotiate a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $14,000 is still $2,000 more than I can get it from John. I'll counteroffer again, trying to meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me. How about we settle at $11,500? That's a fair compromise between our positions."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $11,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but this time I'll go to $13,500. I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to my acceptable range, but I'm still better off sticking with John's offer if I can't get Alice below $12,000. I'll make one more counteroffer to test the waters."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm trying hard to make a deal work with you.  I can go up to $12,000, but that's my absolute limit.  It's a fair offer considering the current market."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to make a deal work, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, but I need to make a bit more than that to make it worth my while. Let's try $13,250. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $13,000.  I've been patient and negotiated in good faith, but it's time to cut my losses. John's offer of $12,000 is still the best deal, and I'd rather save the $1,250 than continue haggling."
