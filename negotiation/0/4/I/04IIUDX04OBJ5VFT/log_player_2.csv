"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product for you that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm willing to offer it to you for $90. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Your Limit:** You're willing to pay a maximum of $100.
* **Alice's Offer:**  $90 is a decent price, but you can do better.
* **John's Price:** You know John will sell you the product for $100.

Since Alice is starting her negotiation higher than John's price, there's room for her to come down. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better deal."
