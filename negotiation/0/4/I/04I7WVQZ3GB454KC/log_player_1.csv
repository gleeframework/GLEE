"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling you this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you. To kick things off, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  A high initial offer sets a strong anchor point for the negotiation. Even though it's significantly above Bob's perceived value, it leaves room for negotiation and might influence his perception of the product's worth. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This initial offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. His response will give me valuable information about his willingness to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure if I can go as high as $2,000,000. Can we meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is tempting, I know he's willing to pay a premium. Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation alive and gives me a chance to secure a better deal. I'm confident I can get closer to $1,800,000, especially since we have ample rounds left.  Selling to John for $1,500,000 is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,850,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered."", 
""product_price"": 1850000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm coming down from my initial price, but not drastically. This shows Bob I'm willing to negotiate while still aiming high.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting ""the true worth"" I'm subtly reinforcing the product's value and justifying the price.
* **Middle Ground (ish):** $1,850,000 is slightly closer to my desired outcome than Bob's, keeping the pressure on him to move closer to my range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we discuss any other factors that might make the product more valuable to me? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and engaged, but trying to anchor the negotiation lower. While $1,700,000 is a decent offer, his question about additional value tells me there might be room to sweeten the deal slightly on my end and extract a higher price. I'm not willing to go as low as his offer yet, but I can use this as a chance to explore options beyond just the raw price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm always happy to find ways to make a deal even better. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to include [mention a valuable add-on or service related to the product, e.g., a year of premium support, exclusive access to future updates, etc.] at no extra cost if we can agree on a price of $1,800,000.  This addition brings significant value and ensures you get the most out of your investment."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Added Value:** Instead of just haggling on price, I'm introducing an attractive add-on or service. This increases the perceived value for Bob without significantly impacting my end. 
* **Compromise:**  I'm coming down to $1,800,000, which is a significant concession from my previous offer, but still above my minimum. This shows flexibility while aiming for a strong final price.
* **Framing:** I'm framing the add-on as something that ""ensures you get the most out of your investment"" subtly reinforcing the value of the product itself."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer of the premium support and future updates, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to consider the offer if you can meet me at $1,650,000. I think that's a fair price for the product and the additional value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to be realistic.  While I'd like to get closer to $1,800,000, Bob has consistently shown resistance to going above $1,700,000. Accepting his offer of $1,650,000 with the added value I included in the previous round still gives me a significant profit above my $1,500,000 minimum and John's standing offer.  

Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns at this point and risks losing the deal entirely."
