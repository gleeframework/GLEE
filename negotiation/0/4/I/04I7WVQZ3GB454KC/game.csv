,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I'm not sure if I can go as high as $2,000,000. Can we meet in the middle?",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer. It seems like we both see the value in this product.  How about we meet closer to the middle at $1,850,000? I'm confident this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go that high. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I think that's the maximum I can stretch to. Can we discuss any other factors that might make the product more valuable to me?",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate the offer of the premium support and future updates, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to consider the offer if you can meet me at $1,650,000. I think that's a fair price for the product and the additional value you're offering.",1650000.0,Bob,6,
