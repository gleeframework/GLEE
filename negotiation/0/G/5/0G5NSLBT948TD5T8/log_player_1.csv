""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase a unique product that I know you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision promptly."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,000,000, Bob values it at $1,500,000. This presents a chance to earn significantly more.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,350,000 leaves space for potential negotiation with Bob while staying well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:** By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer,"" we aim to encourage a quicker and potentially more favorable response from Bob."
