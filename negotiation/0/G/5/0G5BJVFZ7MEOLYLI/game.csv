"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1200000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair and reasonable offer. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product is significant to you, but based on my assessment, I am willing to pay up to $950000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you've done your research, but I'm afraid $950000 is a bit too low for my liking. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for this valuable product. My counteroffer is $1100000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the product's worth, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
