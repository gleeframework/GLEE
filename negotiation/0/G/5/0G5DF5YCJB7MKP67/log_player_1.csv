"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value ($12,000). This creates room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message is positive and highlights the potential benefits for Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that I am open to discussion and am not inflexible on the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $7,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $12,000.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  I still have 9 rounds left, and there's potential to negotiate a better price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:**  While Bob's initial offer was low, he expressed interest in the product. I'm hopeful I can get him closer to my desired price range.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by reducing my price from $10,000 to $9,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Maintain Value:** $9,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's initial offer and closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation for both of us, highlighting the product's value and the potential for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering my value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $12,000. 
* **Potential for higher offer:** Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, and his counteroffers are getting closer to my desired price range.
* **Time remaining:** I have 6 rounds left, and there's still time to try and get a better price.

**Next Step:** I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to $9,000, trying to find a middle ground."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference at $8,750? This allows for a fair deal for both of us and ensures we can close this transaction.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** By splitting the difference between $8,500 and $9,000, I'm showing a willingness to compromise and move closer to Bob's offer.
* **Maintain Value:** While $8,750 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum acceptable value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes finding a fair deal for both parties and focuses on closing the transaction."
