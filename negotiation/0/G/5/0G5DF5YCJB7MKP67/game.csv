"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $7,500 is a bit below what I'm looking for, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This reflects the value of the product and still allows for a good deal for both of us. Let me know if that works for you.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $9,000, but I'm still a bit over my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is a fair price considering my value for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference at $8,750? This allows for a fair deal for both of us and ensures we can close this transaction.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Alice,5,
