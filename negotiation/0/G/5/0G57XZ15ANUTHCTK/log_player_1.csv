"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,200,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring a profit well above my minimum of $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is a decent profit, I can likely do better. I'm not desperate to sell and can still get a better deal with Bob or John.  I'll counter-offer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still keeping it above Bob's offer and my minimum. This shows flexibility and willingness to compromise, while also ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe we can reach a better price. I'll counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, showing flexibility and willingness to compromise. This should be a good middle ground, and I believe Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping for. I believe there's still room for negotiation, so I'll counter-offer one last time before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

This is my final offer to Bob. I'm  lowering the price again to show a willingness to compromise, but I'm sticking firm at this point. If he doesn't accept, I'm willing to sell to John at $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $880,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $880,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is just above John's offer, but there's not much room for further negotiation.  I'm running out of time, and it's better to secure the $800,000 sale to John rather than risk further rounds with Bob and potentially end up with nothing."
