"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its value. With that said, I'm willing to start with an offer of $800,000. I think this is a fair starting point, considering the product's worth to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I do see the value in the product, but I'm aiming for a price point that's a bit more manageable for me. How about we consider a price closer to $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be completely transparent, my budget caps out at $600,000.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",600000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your budget constraints, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $650,000. This is as close as I'm willing to get to your target price. If you're willing to meet me at this point, I'm ready to finalize the deal.",650000.0,Alice,5,
