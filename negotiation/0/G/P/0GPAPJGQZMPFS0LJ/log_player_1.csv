Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're still getting significantly more than your minimum of $800,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left some space for Bob to counteroffer, making the negotiation feel less like an ultimatum. 
* **It's reasonable for Bob:**  It's less than the product's value to him, giving him a potential incentive to accept.

Remember, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low. It's significantly less than your minimum acceptable price, and you have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay more.  

By rejecting Bob's offer, you maintain your position and keep the negotiation open. You'll be able to counteroffer with a price that's more reasonable for you."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  I'll accept $850,000 for the product. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you'll get from it.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

This counteroffer is a strategic move:

* **It's firm but fair:**  You've lowered your price, showing flexibility, but you're still getting more than your minimum.
* **It highlights the value to Bob:** You remind Bob of the product's value, making him more likely to consider your offer.
* **It leaves room for one more round:**  If Bob rejects again, you can still make a final counteroffer before accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price.  How about we meet in the middle at $775,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and saves me a considerable amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than his previous one, it's still below your minimum acceptable price.  You're still better off getting $800,000 from John.

You have one more round of negotiation with Bob, and you can use this to try to get a higher price or to secure a deal with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $775,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To make this deal work, I need to be at $825,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, as it's a significant increase from your previous offer while still leaving you with a substantial profit. Let me know if you're willing to meet me there."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

Here's why this counteroffer is strategic:

* **It's a final push:**  You're nearing your minimum, but still have some room for negotiation. 
* **It highlights the benefits:**  You focus on the positive aspects for both parties. 
* **It's a decisive offer:**  You've made a clear offer, letting Bob know this is likely your final stance. 

If Bob rejects this offer, you have the option to sell to John for $800,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  How about we split the difference and settle at $800,000? It's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tricky situation.  Bob's offer is exactly what John is offering, but there are a few things to consider:

* **Time:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob could drag things out, and you might not be able to get a better price.
* **Certainty:** John is a guaranteed buyer. Bob could still reject your final offer. 
* **The ""split the difference"" tactic:** Bob using this phrase implies he might not be willing to go higher. 

While you could counteroffer Bob again, it's risky. You might end up with nothing, while John is a sure thing. 

Selling to John ensures you get your minimum price and secures the deal quickly."
