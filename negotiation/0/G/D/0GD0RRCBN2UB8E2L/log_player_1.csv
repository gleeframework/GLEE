Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $145. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to $150 as possible, but still offer a price Bob might accept.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $120, so I need to offer a price that's appealing but doesn't leave too much money on the table. 
* **Alternative Buyer:**  I have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so I'm willing to push the price a bit higher with Bob.

By starting at $145, there's room for negotiation if Bob counters, and I still ensure a profit if he accepts outright."
