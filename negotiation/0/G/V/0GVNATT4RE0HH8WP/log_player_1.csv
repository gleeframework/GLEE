Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what the product is worth to me. This is a common tactic in negotiations to leave room for compromise. While Bob may reject this offer, it establishes a starting point and gives me room to lower the price later if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price by counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm counter-offering at $10,500, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to my desired price point. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,800 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  While I'd ideally like to get closer to that, I'm concerned that continuing to negotiate could risk losing him altogether. It's also possible that John could change his mind and decide not to buy. Therefore, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer and secure the sale."
