"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This gives me a good starting point and leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can get a better price than John's offer of $12,000, so I'm not in a rush to sell to him yet.  We'll see how Bob reacts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low. I need to make some money on this, and $12,000 is my absolute minimum.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price that's closer to what I want."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $15,000, but it's still significantly higher than Bob's offer. I want to see if he's willing to budge a bit.  I'm hopeful that he'll recognize the value of my product and meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is still too low.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not going to settle for anything less than $14,000 at this point. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $14,000, which is closer to Bob's last offer but still a fair amount above my minimum.  I believe this shows I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not going to give the product away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not satisfied with Bob's offer.  It's getting closer, but I need to see if I can squeeze out a bit more. I'm not in a huge hurry to sell to John at this point, so I'm going to counteroffer one more time."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This is my final counteroffer. I'm coming down to $13,500, which is halfway between my last offer and Bob's.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a fair compromise and accept the deal. If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's not my ideal price, $12,800 is still significantly more than John's offer.  With only two rounds left, the risk of not making a deal with Bob is too high.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal."
