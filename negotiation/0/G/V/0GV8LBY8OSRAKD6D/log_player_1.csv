Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly reinforce that the price is justified.
* **Alternative Option:**  Subtly implying you have other options (""before I list it publicly"") creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is $15,000, the language suggests you're open to discussion, which is crucial in negotiation. 

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you still have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring you don't lose money."
