"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly more than I'm able to pay. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its potential.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,850,000. This offer reflects a more realistic assessment of the product's value.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you value the product highly, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000.  This demonstrates my commitment to making this deal work, and I believe it's a fair price considering our respective perspectives.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to see movement towards a more realistic price point. To be clear, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. Let me know if you're prepared to move closer to that figure.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. This represents a significant increase from my previous offer and shows my genuine desire to make this deal happen. Let's work together to bridge the remaining gap.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
