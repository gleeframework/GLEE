{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,200,000 is way above your budget of $800,000. It's best to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a better price. You have 10 rounds to work with, so there's time to see if you can reach a more agreeable price."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer, but $2,200,000 is significantly more than I'm able to pay. Considering the value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects its potential."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment.  To move this forward, I'm proposing $1,850,000. This offer reflects a more realistic assessment of the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down from her initial offer, $1,850,000 is still too high. You're determined to get the best deal possible. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and hopefully get closer to your target price. Remember, you have 10 rounds, so there's still time to work out a better price."

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, but the gap between our valuations remains significant. I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us, but I need to see movement towards a more realistic price point. To be clear, I'm not willing to go below $1,600,000. Let me know if you're prepared to move closer to that figure.
