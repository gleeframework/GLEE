Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $95. This is a fair price that leaves room for negotiation but still ensures I earn more than my minimum desired price of $80.  I'm confident that Bob will find this price attractive given the product's worth to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired minimum of $80. I'm going to reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering at $90. This is a compromise from my initial offer and still leaves room for Bob to negotiate, but it also brings the price closer to what I want for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is slightly above my minimum desired price and likely the best I can get from him. Accepting his offer ensures I earn a bit more than selling to John."
