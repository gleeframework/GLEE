"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the discount, but I believe we can reach a better agreement. How about $820,000 for the product? This still allows you to make a profit while keeping the price within my budget.",820000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to stay within my budget. Would $860,000 be acceptable for the product? This still gives you a good profit margin while keeping the price lower than my initial valuation.",860000.0,Bob,4,
