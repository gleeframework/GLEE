I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but still leaves room for negotiation.  If he rejects this offer, I'm prepared to counter-offer and potentially even sell to John for my minimum price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, it's still not high enough. I'm going to try to get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

I'm countering with $10,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between our previous offers. I'm hopeful this will be enough to entice him to buy, while still netting me a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still not worth the risk of further negotiation. I'm going to take the guaranteed $12,000 from John. It's better to secure a known profit than to risk a lower offer or a stalemate."
