"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product to me.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $16,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. Would you be willing to consider $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $16,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $14,000. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  $14,000 is closer, but to be honest, anything above $13,000 is going to be a tough sell for me.  How about we split the difference and call it $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,250. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me.",13250.0,Alice,7,
