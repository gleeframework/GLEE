Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $13,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $13,250. It's a fair price that still reflects the value of the product to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,250. While this price is below her value, it's getting too close to your maximum budget of $10,000. Buying from John guarantees you save the most money, even if it means you don't get the potentially better deal from Alice."
