Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is far too low for me. This product is high-quality and in high demand. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000?

Round 4

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I need to get a fair price for this product. $7,000 is too low, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $12,000, which she states is her final offer. This is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  You have the option to continue negotiating, but there's no guarantee Alice will budge further.  John offers a guaranteed price of $8,000, which meets your budget.  

It's more advantageous at this point to take the guaranteed deal from John rather than risk Alice not negotiating further."
