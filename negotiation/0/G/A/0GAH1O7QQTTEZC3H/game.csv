"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $6,000. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $6,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I like your thinking, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $7,500. I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,5,
