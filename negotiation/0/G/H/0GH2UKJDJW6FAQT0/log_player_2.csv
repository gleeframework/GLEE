"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can do better than $9,500.  While it's less than John's price, there's still room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to go up to $8,500 for the product.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to get for the product.  Let's see if we can agree on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,000 is still a good deal for Bob. It's lower than what John is offering, and it's closer to Bob's target price. There's always a risk that Alice will reject a further counteroffer, and then Bob would be left with only John's option at $10,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a good deal for Bob."
