Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, but leaves some room for negotiation. It also emphasizes the benefit to Bob.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll be ready to counter and assess whether it's worth continuing to negotiate with him or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,200. I really like the product, but I have a limited budget. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price, and I am willing to negotiate.  I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I appreciate your interest, $8,200 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,800. That's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8800} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $8,800, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,400. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I am willing to negotiate, Bob's offer of $8,400 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Since John is willing to pay my minimum, it is more advantageous to sell to John and secure a better price."
