# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to get a good deal, but I'm not comfortable going down to $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,500. It's still a great price, and I think you'll be happy with the value you'll get from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

Bob should continue negotiating.  He's still saving money compared to John's price, and Alice has shown willingness to negotiate."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get closer to your target price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $9,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,250. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

At this point, Bob has already negotiated a pretty good deal with Alice.  The price is significantly lower than John's, and Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal altogether."
