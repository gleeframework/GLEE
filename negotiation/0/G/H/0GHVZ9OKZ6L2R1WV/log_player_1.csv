Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $9,500 is a fair price. Can we meet at that number? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firm on $9,500. Accepting this offer secures a profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
