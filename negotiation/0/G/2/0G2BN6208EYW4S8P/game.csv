"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's unfortunately above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $975,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",975000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $975,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. I'll offer $900,000.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $925,000 is closer, I'm still a bit over budget. I'm prepared to offer $910,000. This is my final offer, as I'm very close to my budget limit. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",910000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $910,000 is your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I've already compromised a lot, and I think the product is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my original price. I can offer it to you for $920,000. This is my final counteroffer.",920000.0,Alice,7,
