Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the willingness to meet halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'd like to propose $1,250,000 as a compromise. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget constraints.

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob clearly sees value in the product. Let's counter and see if we can push a little closer to $1,300,000."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but I still need to be mindful of my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- Bob is consistently increasing his offer, showing he's still engaged and values the product. 
- We're still significantly above John's offer ($1,000,000).
- By continuing to counter, we maintain the possibility of getting closer to our desired price point.  

**Next Steps:**

In the next round, we'll propose a counteroffer between $1,225,000 and $1,275,000. We need to carefully consider our increments to avoid pushing Bob away while still aiming for a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're right, we are getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to work towards a deal. How about we land at $1,260,000? This feels like a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while acknowledging your budget concerns."", 
""product_price"": 1260000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

- We acknowledge Bob's observation that they are close to a deal, reinforcing a positive negotiation environment.
- This offer splits the difference between our last offer ($1,275,000) and his last offer ($1,225,000), showing willingness to compromise but still pushing for a higher price. 
- We're still significantly above John's offer, giving us some room to negotiate further if needed."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you at $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price that accounts for the product's value and my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

- **Diminishing Returns:**  While we're still above John's offer, the increments Bob is offering are getting smaller. Continuing to push might risk him walking away.
- **Time Constraint:** We're down to the final rounds. If we reject this offer, there's a risk we won't be able to negotiate a significantly better price before time runs out.
- **Solid Profit:**  $1,220,000 is a significant profit margin over our minimum ($1,000,000) and a respectable outcome for the negotiation. 

Sometimes, a good deal in hand is better than the possibility of a slightly better deal that might not materialize."
