"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can do better than $110.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $105. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $107? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

You can still get a better price.  Rejecting this offer will give you another chance to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $107 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference, how about $106? "", ""product_price"": 106}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $106, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

```

At this point, it's more beneficial to buy from John for $100.  While you could continue negotiating with Alice, the price is unlikely to go lower than $106, and it's not worth the risk of her rejecting your next counteroffer.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at the lowest price available."
