"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get as close to my minimum value as possible.  Since Bob values the product at $8,000, this is still a good deal for him, and it gives us room to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price. While it's tempting to accept it, I believe there is room for improvement.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if he's willing to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is still a good deal for me, as it's above my minimum value. It also shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away the product for a significantly lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not enough. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate a better deal. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm not willing to settle for anything below my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $10,500. This shows Bob that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I'm still not willing to go below my minimum.  I'm hoping that he will see this as a fair compromise and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, and we're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  While I'm tempted to take the $8,800, I believe there is still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm making a final counteroffer at $10,000. This is a significant concession, but I believe it's a fair price for both of us. I'm hoping Bob will finally accept this offer.  If he doesn't, I'm ready to sell to John for $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum value, and we only have two rounds left.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price that's too low, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000."
