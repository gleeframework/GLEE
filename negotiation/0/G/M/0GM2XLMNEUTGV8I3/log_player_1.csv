Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. It also positions the price as a good deal, potentially motivating Bob to accept. 

If Bob rejects, I'll assess his counteroffer. If it's close to my minimum, I'll consider it.  Otherwise, I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum.  If the negotiation stalls, I have the option to sell to John for my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum price of $15,000.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't sell for less than my minimum. I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my desired value, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $13,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I still cannot go above $12,000. Could you perhaps lower your price slightly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still far below my minimum, and I've already made a significant compromise.  It's clear that we won't be able to reach an agreement. It's time to move on and sell to John for my desired price."
