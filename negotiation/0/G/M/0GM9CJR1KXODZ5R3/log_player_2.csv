Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're absolutely right, we are very close!  I value your willingness to negotiate and I want to see this deal through.  My final offer is $1,400,000.  This reflects my absolute bottom line, and I'm confident it's a fair price for a product of this caliber.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down, she's unlikely to move significantly from her final offer of $1,400,000. It's too big of a risk to try and negotiate further, as you could end up with a worse outcome.  Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price point of $1,000,000, saving you a substantial amount."
