{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've started with a price of $1,400,000. This is a good starting point because it's more than Bob's perceived value of $1,200,000 but still significantly less than my minimum of $1,500,000. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** I've kept the message friendly and encouraging, focusing on the benefits for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a price that's reasonable but still leaves room for negotiation, I'm hoping to:

* **Engage Bob:** Encourage Bob to enter into the negotiation process.
* **Maximize Profit:**  If Bob accepts, I get a good price. If he rejects, it gives me the opportunity to gauge his interest and negotiate further.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response.
* If he rejects, I'll be ready to make a counter-offer based on his proposed price.
* I'll also keep in mind my fallback option with John, who is willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. Accepting it would mean taking a large financial loss. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident that I can get a better deal through further negotiation. 

**Strategy:**

* **Reject and Counteroffer:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can keep the negotiation going. I will make a counteroffer to try and bridge the gap. 
* **Leverage John:** I'll keep in mind that John is a potential buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. This gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider what counteroffer to make to Bob, aiming for a price that is closer to my minimum but still attractive to him.
* I'll also be prepared to walk away from the deal if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? That's still a great price for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm proposing $1,300,000, which is exactly halfway between my previous offer of $1,400,000 and Bob's offer of $1,200,000. This shows a willingness to compromise and meet in the middle.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and focused on the benefits for Bob, highlighting that this price is still a good deal for him while also getting us closer to a deal.

**Strategy:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise, making it more likely that Bob will accept.
* **Maintain Leverage:**  While $1,300,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum.  I'm still prepared to walk away if Bob won't budge further. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll carefully consider Bob's response.
* If he rejects, I'll be prepared to make another counteroffer, but I'll be more hesitant to reduce my price further. 
* I'll keep in mind that John is a backup option who is willing to pay my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit far from $1,300,000. How about we try $1,250,000? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than Bob's previous offer, it's still significantly lower than my target.  I'm confident that I can get a better deal with a final counteroffer.

**Strategy:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'll reject Bob's offer and make a final counteroffer to try and bridge the remaining gap. This will be my last chance to negotiate with Bob before considering selling to John.
* **Leverage John:** I'll use John as a backup option to show Bob that I'm not desperate to make a deal with him.

**Next Steps:**

* I'll make a final counteroffer to Bob, trying to reach a price as close as possible to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* If Bob rejects this final counteroffer, I will sell the product to John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I really appreciate your interest in the product. I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,250,000 is simply too far from what I can accept. To be completely transparent, I have another buyer who is willing to pay my minimum asking price.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my final offer.  Let me know what you decide."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $1,350,000, which is a compromise between my previous offer of $1,300,000 and Bob's offer of $1,250,000. 
* **Message:** I'm being direct and transparent about my minimum asking price and the fact that I have another buyer. This subtly increases pressure on Bob to accept. I'm also emphasizing that this is my final offer.

**Strategy:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer to Bob. I'm trying to get as close as possible to my minimum price while still being reasonable. 
* **Leverage John:** I'm subtly reminding Bob that I have an alternative buyer, which gives me leverage.
* **Transparency:** Being upfront about my minimum price and the other buyer adds credibility and puts pressure on Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've successfully negotiated a better price than his initial offer.
* If Bob rejects, I'll sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come closer to my desired price, his offer of $1,300,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  I have already made my final offer and I'm confident that I can get my minimum price from John.

**Strategy:**

* **Walk Away:**  I've already negotiated extensively with Bob and have made it clear that I'm not willing to go lower than $1,350,000.  I'm not going to risk losing a significant amount of money by accepting a lower offer.
* **Secure the Best Deal:**  By selling to John, I ensure that I receive the best possible price for the product. 

**Next Steps:**

* I will contact John and finalize the sale for $1,500,000."
