Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to get a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm thinking $14,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation: Bob is consistently offering prices significantly below my minimum. At this point, it's unlikely he'll agree to a price that's beneficial for me.  Selling to John guarantees I get my minimum acceptable price."
