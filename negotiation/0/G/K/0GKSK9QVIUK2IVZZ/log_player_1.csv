Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your interests. I'm happy to part with it for $1,100,000."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows you to potentially secure a deal quickly and still earn a profit.
* **Reasonable Markup:** Offering the product at $1,100,000 represents a 10% markup from Bob's perceived value. This is a reasonable profit margin and increases the likelihood of Bob accepting.
* **Time Value of Money:** Selling to Bob quickly avoids potential delays involved with John.  

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Negotiation Skills:**  If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher to leave room for bargaining.
* **Urgency:** If you need to sell the product immediately, offering it closer to John's price might be necessary."
