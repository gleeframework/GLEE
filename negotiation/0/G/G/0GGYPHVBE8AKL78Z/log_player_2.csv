"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value in today's market is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but this offer stands as a testament to the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. There's no reason to negotiate with Alice when you can get the product for a much better price elsewhere."
