Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. Any deal depends on you convincing Bob to pay more than he values the product or you accepting less than your guaranteed amount.

**Strategy**

Since there's no ZOPA based on the current valuations, you have two main options:

1. **High Anchor & Negotiation:**  Start with a high price to try and shift Bob's perception of the product's value. This requires strong negotiation skills and the willingness to walk away if Bob doesn't budge significantly.
2. **Accept John's Offer:**  This guarantees you the best possible outcome without the risk of negotiation.

**Offer (High Anchor & Negotiation Example)**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Its value in today's market is undeniable, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.  Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, but this offer stands as a testament to the product's worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Important Considerations:**

* **Relationship:** How important is a future relationship with Bob? A very high offer could strain this.
* **Bob's Personality:** Is Bob known to negotiate aggressively? If so, be prepared for a counter-offer.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Do you have time for negotiations, or is a quick sale to John preferable? 

**Ultimately, the best offer depends on your risk tolerance and how much you're willing to negotiate.**"
