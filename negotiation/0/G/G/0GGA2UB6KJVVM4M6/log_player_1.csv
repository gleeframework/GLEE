Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to save as much as I can. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a decent offer, I'm still hoping to get closer to my minimum value of $1,200,000. I believe there's still room for negotiation and I'm willing to explore it further.  Selling to John right now would be the safest option, but I'm not convinced that's the most profitable path."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $950,000.  This is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $920,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $1,200,000. I have 6 rounds left and I'm still hoping to secure a better deal.  I believe there's still room for negotiation, and I'm willing to explore it further. Selling to John right now would be a safe choice, but I'm not convinced it's the best option for maximizing my profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I need to get closer to my asking price. I'm willing to come down to $940,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the potential we see in this partnership. Let's find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 940000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the market. I'm willing to meet you halfway and come down to this price. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $910,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $910,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time.  Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm approaching a point where I'm risking losing too much money by continuing to negotiate.  I've been trying to get closer to my desired price point, but it seems unlikely that Bob will meet my minimum value.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value and allows me to secure a deal without further risk."
