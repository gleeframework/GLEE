You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's better than her initial asking price, you can still do better. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."

You should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to your target price, you can still negotiate further.  You should try to counteroffer again at a price slightly higher than your target price.  It's still a good deal for Alice and leaves some room for further negotiations."

You should accept Alice's offer.  $10,000 is a good price, considering that you can buy the product from John for $8,000. It's better to accept Alice's offer rather than risk her rejecting your counteroffer, which might lead to further negotiation rounds."
