"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective on the price, $7,000 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider coming down to $8,800. This feels like a fair compromise.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,800 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we possibly settle somewhere around $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap between the value this product offers you and what you're willing to pay.  I can go as low as $8,200, but that's my final offer.",8200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand this product has value, but I have a firm budget. If you're willing to meet me at $7,800, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",7800.0,Bob,6,
