"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe could be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $900000. It's a significant investment, but I'm confident it will pay off handsomely. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I'd prefer to work with you if possible. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is available for $1,500,000 from John, which is a better deal than Alice's offer.
