"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,000,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $750,000.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still quite a distance from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us.",800000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is closer to my target price.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $825,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before we have to consider other options.",825000.0,Alice,7,
