"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe it's a bit steep at $1,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $700,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I still have 8 rounds to negotiate with Bob, and I believe I can get a better deal.  I'm also holding out hope that I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $700,000 is a good starting point, it's significantly below what the product is worth to me. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and provides a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $750,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not ideal.  I'm confident that with continued negotiation, I can get closer to my target of $1,200,000.  I also have the option of selling to John for that price if Bob doesn't meet my expectations.  With 6 rounds remaining, I'm in a strong position to continue negotiations."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  While $750,000 is closer, it's still quite a distance from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  I'm confident this is a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $800,000. I'm willing to meet you at $775,000, which is closer to my target price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $775,000 is a good offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I have four rounds left to negotiate with Bob, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price. 

I'm also considering the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, which is my ideal outcome. However, I'm not ready to give up on Bob yet. There's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective and appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $775,000 is still too far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down a bit further, to $825,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end and leaves room for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can reach an agreement before we have to consider other options."", ""product_price"": 825000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $785,000, which is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

With only two rounds remaining, I'm running out of time to get closer to my target price with Bob. While $785,000 is a decent offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. 

It's time to cut my losses and move on to the guaranteed sale with John.  This ensures that I achieve my minimum desired profit, and I avoid the risk of ending the negotiation with Bob at a lower price."
