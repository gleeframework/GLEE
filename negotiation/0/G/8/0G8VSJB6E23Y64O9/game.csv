"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value I've already placed on it. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
