"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $750,000. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product, which is closer to our middle ground. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us.",780000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. How about we meet at $810,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think?",810000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $810,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $790,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's only $10,000 less than John's offer.  I believe this is a price that benefits both of us.",790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $820,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's worth considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",820000.0,Alice,7,
