# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your budget. It's best to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $900,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $825,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think the product's value is worth a bit more than $750,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to my budget, I'm still willing to try and negotiate a lower price.  $825,000 is still too high, and I believe there's room for further compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $825,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $780,000 for the product, which is closer to our middle ground. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value to both of us."", ""product_price"": 780000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $780,000. How about we meet at $810,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the product's value, and it's a bit closer to what I'm looking for. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $810,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $810,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While it's tempting to accept as it's closer to the price from John, I'm determined to see if I can get a lower price from Alice.  I still believe there's room for negotiation, and I'm not ready to give up just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $810,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $790,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering it's only $10,000 less than John's offer.  I believe this is a price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 790000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $790,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $820,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it's worth considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $820,000 is closer to my budget, it's still a bit higher than I'd like.  I've reached my limit for negotiating with Alice, and I don't want to risk further rounds of counteroffers potentially driving the price up again. 

John's offer of $800,000 is a solid deal that fits within my budget, and it's more certain than continuing negotiations with Alice.  Therefore, I'm going to accept John's offer and purchase the product from him."
