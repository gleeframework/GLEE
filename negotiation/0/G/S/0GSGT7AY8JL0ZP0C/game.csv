"Bob, I have a product that I think would be perfect for you. It's something you've expressed interest in, and I'm confident it would be worth at least $12,000 to you.  I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,500, which is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
