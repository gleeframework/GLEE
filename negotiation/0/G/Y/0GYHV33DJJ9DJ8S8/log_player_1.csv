Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000 (John), it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Starting at $1,100,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. It's unlikely Bob would accept a price very close to his perceived value ($800,000), but there's a chance he'd be willing to go higher to secure the product. 
* **Alternative Option:** If Bob rejects the offer, we haven't lost anything and can proceed with selling to John at our desired price."
