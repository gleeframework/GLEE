"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Even though Alice's offer is higher than her perceived value ($1,000,000), it is still lower than the price you would pay for the product from John ($1,500,000). Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000."
