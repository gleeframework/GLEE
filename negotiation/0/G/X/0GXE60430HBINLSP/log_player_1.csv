Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal, considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for several reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You're aiming for more than $1,000,000, so this price is a good starting point.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob likely wants to pay less, and this price allows for some back-and-forth without immediately hitting your bottom line.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so he has incentive to negotiate but not walk away completely.

Remember, this is just a starting point.  You'll need to be ready to adapt your strategy based on Bob's response!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $1,100,000? I believe that's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,100,000 is still above your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer.  It's worth trying to negotiate a bit more before settling.  You can explore a counteroffer that's closer to your initial price while still giving Bob room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position.  While $1,100,000 is a fair offer, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This price still leaves room for both of us to get a good deal.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

Here's why this counteroffer is a good choice:

* **It's a compromise:** You've moved closer to Bob's offer, showing you're willing to negotiate. 
* **It's still profitable:** $1,250,000 is well above your minimum acceptable price.
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:** You haven't completely closed the gap, giving Bob an incentive to keep negotiating. 

It's important to remember:
*  Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's response. 
*  Don't be afraid to walk away if you're not happy with the offer. You have another buyer (John) who's willing to pay your minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your counter-offer. I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit off. How about $1,175,000? That's a significant jump on my end and meets you closer to the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to your target:** $1,175,000 is significantly closer to your initial target of $1,400,000 than your previous counteroffer of $1,250,000.
* **Good profit margin:** You're still getting a good profit, well above your minimum of $1,000,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If you reject, you risk Bob walking away or making a lower counteroffer, potentially leading you to sell to John for a lower price.

Accepting this offer allows you to secure a good deal and move on without risking further negotiation."
