Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and would be a valuable asset for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I'm confident you'll find this price fair considering the potential returns."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000, trying to sell to Bob first allows me to potentially earn even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $1,400,000 is a significant markup from Bob's perceived value of $800,000. However, it's still a substantial discount from what John is willing to pay. This price aims to:
    *  Make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.
    * Leave me with a significant profit even if Bob accepts.
* **Confident Message:** The message aims to project confidence in the product's value without revealing my bottom line."
