{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $13,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earn a little extra. I'm also trying to be friendly and encouraging in my message to build a positive rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $11,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to come up a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go as low as $11,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? I'm confident you'll find this product to be a valuable asset."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,800 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm not willing to go that low.  While I would like to get a higher price, I also don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  Selling to John for $12,000 guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
