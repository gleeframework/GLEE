{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It is above Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000 but gives him some room to negotiate and still makes a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. While I'd like to sell the product, I need to make a profit that justifies the value to me. I'll counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,125,000.  This price still allows you to make a profit and is closer to my value.  Let's make a deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
