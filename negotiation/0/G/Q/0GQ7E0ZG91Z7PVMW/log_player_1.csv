"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value but not so high that it immediately discourages him. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  There's room to negotiate down if needed, but also a chance to potentially secure a higher price.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a good deal for Bob,  making it more likely he'll consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's closer to my minimum,  $8,500 is still significantly lower than what I consider the product's worth. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's still room to negotiate a better price. 
* **Time is on my side:** I have 10 rounds, and selling to John is a safety net if the negotiation stalls."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but not drastically.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""significant drop"" to make it seem like a generous offer.
* **Clear Objective:** I'm setting a clear expectation for the next round, hoping to find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can close the deal here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Holding Firm:**  Bob is sticking to his $8,500 offer, but it's still too low for me. 
* **Time Advantage:**  I still have several rounds left, and I'm not desperate to close the deal.
* **Alternative:**  Selling to John for $15,000 remains a viable option if I can't get a better price from Bob. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still a chance I can get Bob to come up a bit more in the next few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  It's a fair price considering our previous offers and the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by moving closer to Bob's price, but still maintaining a margin that's closer to my minimum.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm highlighting the ""halfway"" point to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Motivating Factor:**  The offer is close enough to Bob's range that he might be motivated to close the deal.
* **Time Factor:**  We're halfway through the rounds, so I need to be strategic about securing a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $9,000.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can find a way to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $9,000 is just above my minimum of $8,500.
* **Time Factor:** We are in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds to close a deal. 
* **Risk Assessment:**  While I could attempt another counteroffer, there's a risk that Bob might get even more stubborn, making it harder to close a deal. 
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Accepting the offer ensures a sale and avoids the risk of losing out on both Bob and John.

**Overall, while $9,000 isn't ideal, it's a decent compromise considering the time constraint and the potential for a stalemate.**"
