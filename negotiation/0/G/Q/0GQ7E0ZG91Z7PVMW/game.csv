"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,000, which is a significant drop from my initial offer. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $10,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm firm on my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price considering your initial asking price and the value it holds for me. Let's see if we can close the deal here.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 just doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,250.  It's a fair price considering our previous offers and the value the product holds for you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,250 is still a bit above what I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $9,000.  If you're serious about selling, I think we can find a way to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
