"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $10,000 from Alice.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is willing to sell for at least $8,000, so this offer is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer. It's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still offers a profit for her. This approach allows for further negotiation while staying within your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within your budget and is significantly cheaper than buying from John. While you might be able to negotiate a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting your counteroffer and ultimately forcing you to buy from John at $12,000 is too high. Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product for a good price and avoids potential delays and complications."
