Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for negotiation. Since Bob values the product at $12,000, this offer is attractive to him while still leaving you with a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I can still try to get a better price.  I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm raising the price slightly to $9,500. This is still a good deal for Bob, and it gets me closer to my target price."
