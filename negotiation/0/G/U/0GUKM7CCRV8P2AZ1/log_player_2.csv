"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's too early to accept Alice's offer. The price is way above your maximum, so rejecting and counter-offering makes more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
``` 

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within your acceptable range.  It shows that you're serious about buying the product, but also sets a clear expectation that you're looking for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $90 is getting closer to your limit, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting allows you to make another counteroffer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's closer to Alice's offer, showing you are willing to meet halfway, but still lower than your maximum price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Even though Alice is getting close to your maximum price, there's still room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get her down to $80 before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

This is your final offer. You are willing to pay your maximum price for the product, but you will not go any higher. If Alice rejects this offer, you will purchase the product from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is too high, and you've already made your final counteroffer. It's time to move on and buy from John, securing the product for your maximum price."
