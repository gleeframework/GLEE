,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as 85. How about we meet in the middle at 105? It's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $95.  This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as 95. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer: 100. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
