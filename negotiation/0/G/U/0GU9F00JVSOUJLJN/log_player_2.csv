"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe holds significant value. While I cannot disclose specifics at this time, I assure you it's worth at least $1500000 to me.  I'm offering it to you for $1800000, which reflects the potential it holds. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party willing to pay $1500000. Let me know if you'd like to discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,800,000, which is higher than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  While Alice claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to her, that doesn't change your own valuation.  It's better to reject Alice's offer and buy the product from John for $1,200,000."
