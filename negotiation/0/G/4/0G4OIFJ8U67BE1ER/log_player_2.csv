I'm going to reject Alice's offer. While it's a good price, I can potentially get it for less.  I'm going to try to negotiate a better deal."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! However, I've got to make a profit on this one. I can do $108, and that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108

Alice's offer is a good deal. It's only $8 more than what the product is worth to her, and $12 less than what I'd pay from John. I'm going to accept this offer and buy the product from Alice."
