"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity,  $1,200,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a slight discount, considering our previous discussions. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final counteroffer for now.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,180,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us.",1180000.0,Alice,5,
