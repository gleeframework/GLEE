Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to be flexible. I can offer you a slight discount, considering our previous discussions. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,150,000. This is my final counteroffer for now.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're able to continue the negotiation. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,180,000. This is a compromise, but I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay.  While we've made some progress, it's getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds.  At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at a lower price, even if it means missing out on potentially getting an even better deal with Alice."
