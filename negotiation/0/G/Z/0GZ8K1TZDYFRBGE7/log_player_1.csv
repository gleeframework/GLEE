Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the benefits you'll reap from it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me, but not at that cost. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the initial price. However,  $800,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This is my best offer and a significant compromise considering its value."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we need to find some middle ground here.  $1,900,000 is still much higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet halfway at $1,350,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While I could push for more, accepting at $1,350,000 is a safe and profitable choice. It avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds, potentially leaving me with a lower offer or needing to settle for John's $1,500,000."
