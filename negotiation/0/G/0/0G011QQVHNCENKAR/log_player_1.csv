Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good balance between maximizing your profit and ensuring a sale. Here's why:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're getting $1,500 more than your minimum acceptable price of $8,000.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  Bob is willing to pay $10,000, so you're leaving some room for him to feel like he's getting a good deal. This increases the likelihood of him accepting.
* **It's a good fallback:** If Bob rejects, you still have John who's willing to pay $8,000. This ensures you won't lose out on the sale entirely."
