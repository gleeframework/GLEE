Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm asking for $19,000 for it.  I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $15,000, I want to start with a price significantly higher to explore the potential for a larger profit margin.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $19,000 leaves space for Bob to negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a deal if he manages to get it for less.
* **Guaranteed Sale:** Even if Bob rejects the offer, I'm secured by John's willingness to buy at my minimum acceptable price.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing profit while acknowledging the importance of securing a sale."
