Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about $13,000? That's still a good price for you and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 13000}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. Although it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,500 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $13,250?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. Considering our previous discussions, could we possibly agree on $12750 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached the point where I'm not confident that I can get a better price from Bob. It's getting close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still not quite there. Considering that I have John waiting to buy at my desired price, it's in my best interest to sell to John and secure the $15,000."
