{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Leaves room for negotiation:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value, allowing for potential counteroffers.
* **Maximizes your profit:** It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price.
* **Sets a positive tone:** The message is friendly and suggests a willingness to negotiate.

Remember, you can always adjust the price and message depending on Bob's response and your assessment of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

```

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This still leaves room for both of us to feel good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Room for negotiation:** While it's a bit closer to your minimum acceptable price, it still leaves room for Bob to make a counteroffer if necessary.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $12,500, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $12,250. I think this is a fair price that works for both of us.
