"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for this product, given its value to me. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our interests.",1750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you considering my offer and providing your perspective. While your valuation is understandable, the product's inherent value and potential ROI justify a higher price point. I'm willing to move down to $2,000,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise.",2000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $2,000,000 is still outside my budget. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,850,000. This price is closer to my limit and reflects the value I see in the product. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1850000.0,Bob,4,
