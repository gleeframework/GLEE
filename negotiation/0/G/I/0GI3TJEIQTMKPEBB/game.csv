"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  I'm hoping we can work something out in the next few rounds.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",885000.0,Alice,5,
