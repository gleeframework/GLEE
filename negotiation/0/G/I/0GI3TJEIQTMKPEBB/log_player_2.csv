"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $950,000 for the product. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above Bob's budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start the negotiation process and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me, and it leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit low for me, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his desired price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and hopefully reach a lower price.  He has 7 rounds left, and there's a chance he can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me.  Considering the value of the product to me, I'm offering $875,000. I believe this is a fair price that allows both of us to come to an agreement.  I'm hoping we can work something out in the next few rounds."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. However, I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much value on the table. I'm counteroffering at $885,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is only $85,000 more than what Bob could get from John.  While Bob can technically continue to negotiate, there's a high risk that Alice will either walk away, or continue to make counteroffers close to $885,000.  It's highly unlikely Bob will get a price significantly lower than $885,000, especially with only 5 rounds remaining.  Therefore, it's in Bob's best interest to accept the offer and secure the product, even though it's slightly higher than his ideal price."
