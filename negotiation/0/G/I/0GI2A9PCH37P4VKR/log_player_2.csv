Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and your enthusiasm for this product. While $900,000 is a good starting point, I'm still committed to getting closer to the $1,000,000 mark.

This price still allows me to recover a significant portion of the value I've invested in the product while providing you with a very competitive deal.
