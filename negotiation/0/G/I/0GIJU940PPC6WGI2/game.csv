"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to meet you a little closer to the middle, but I can only go up to $1,050,000. Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 2-year warranty and a premium support package. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
