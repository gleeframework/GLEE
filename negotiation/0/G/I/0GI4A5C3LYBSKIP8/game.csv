"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you meet me at this price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're interested in the product, Bob, but $900000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the best I can do for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above that price. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, but $950000 is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet. I'm willing to make another concession, so I'm counteroffering at $1020000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1020000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting close, Bob, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1080000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1080000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but I'm not willing to go above $1080000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $980000 and $1080000, which is $1030000. Can you consider this price?",1030000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $1030000 is still a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to make a final concession to try to reach an agreement. I'm counteroffering at $1090000. This is my absolute minimum price, and I'm not willing to go any lower.",1090000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price, but I'm still not willing to go above $1080000. I'm willing to meet you at this price, and I think it's a fair deal for both of us. Can you accept this price?",1080000.0,Bob,10,
