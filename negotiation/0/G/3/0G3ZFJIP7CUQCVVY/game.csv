"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $17,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and I pay you $15,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",15500.0,Bob,4,
