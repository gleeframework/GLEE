"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000. I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium.  This also leaves room for negotiation in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept and secure a sale quickly, I'm confident I can get a better price.  I'm not willing to drop below $1,000,000 at this point.  There's still time for negotiations, and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my offer slightly, but still maintaining a price higher than Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while also demonstrating my confidence in the product's value.  I'm aiming to find a middle ground and reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price. I'm not ready to settle for $950,000 just yet. There's still time to see if we can bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's above Bob's last offer. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping Bob will accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's getting very close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  We've both made compromises, and I believe there's still room for us to find a mutually agreeable price.  I'm not ready to sell for less than $1,000,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

I'm making a final push to get closer to my desired price. This counteroffer is a small compromise, but it's still within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping Bob will recognize that we're both close to a deal and agree to this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

It's getting down to the wire, and I'm feeling the pressure to close a deal. While Bob's offer is very close to my minimum, I'm starting to worry that we might not reach a mutually agreeable price within the remaining rounds.  Instead of risking another rejection, I'm going to sell to John for $1,000,000.  It's a guaranteed sale, and I'm comfortable with the price."
