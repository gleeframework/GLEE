"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Would you be willing to meet me there?",9800.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,800 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it. Let's make this deal!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9200.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're still a bit apart on price, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer the product for $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope you'll consider it. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm getting the feeling we might not be able to agree on a price.  I'm willing to make one last offer.  I'll sell the product to you for $10,200. This is the lowest I can go, so I hope you'll give it serious consideration.",10200.0,Alice,7,
