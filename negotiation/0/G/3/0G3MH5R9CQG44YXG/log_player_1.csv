I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell quickly, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While I'm getting closer to a deal, $9,200 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'll counteroffer in the next round and try to bridge the gap further."

I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000.  I've reached the point where I'm running out of time, and Bob's final offer is still too low.  It's better to secure a deal with John at my minimum acceptable price than to risk getting a lower offer or no deal at all."
