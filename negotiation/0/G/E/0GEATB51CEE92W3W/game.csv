"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1500000. It's a valuable asset that will be worth every penny to you. I know this is a fair price, given the product's worth to both of us. If you decide to pass, I have another buyer lined up who is also willing to pay the full value.  Let me know your decision.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
