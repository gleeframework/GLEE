"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$115:** This price is above Bob's value of $100 but below my minimum value of $120.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I still make a profit. 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and encourages Bob to see the value in the product while not giving away too much. 
* **First Round:** This is my opening offer. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $100. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reject Bob's offer:** While $100 is my minimum,  I'm not desperate to sell immediately.  I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. 
* **Next Round:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired $115. 
* **Selling to John:**  I'm keeping John as a backup option in case negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint.  I'm willing to come down to $110, but that's the lowest I can go.  It's still a great price for such a valuable product."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$110:** This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still remaining above my minimum.
* **Message:**  I reiterate my willingness to negotiate, emphasizing the value of the product and framing the price as a good deal.
* **Strategy:**  I'm hoping Bob will accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiations if needed."
