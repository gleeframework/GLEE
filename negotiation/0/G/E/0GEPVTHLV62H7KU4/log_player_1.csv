"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,600,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious offer on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,600,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is considerably higher. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,800,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to meet me halfway, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to go up to $1,700,000, but I need to be careful with my budget. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000

We're still doing well in the negotiation. Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's motivated. We have room to push further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $1,700,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,725,000. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,725,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a bit more, accepting at $1,725,000 is a strong deal.  We're securing a significant profit over our minimum and John's offer.  The longer the negotiation continues, the higher the risk of Bob walking away."
