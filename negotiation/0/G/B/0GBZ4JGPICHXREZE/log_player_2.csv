"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal for you, as you know its value. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's see if we can get a better price from Alice before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $100?"",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer to gauge Alice's flexibility. We have room to negotiate upwards, and this gives us a better starting point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $115.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to a reasonable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit further before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

This counteroffer shows Alice we are willing to compromise and move closer to her price, but we're still aiming for a good deal."
