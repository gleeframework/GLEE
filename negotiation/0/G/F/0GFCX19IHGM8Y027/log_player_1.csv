Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product, which I think is a fair price based on its value. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $90 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $105, so I'll offer $95. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer price, it's unlikely he'll reach $100.  At this point, the difference in potential profit isn't worth the risk of further negotiation rounds.  Selling to John guarantees the maximum profit."
