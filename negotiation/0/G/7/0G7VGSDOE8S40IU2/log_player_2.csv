"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a fortune, and I know you'll be able to maximize its potential. My initial offer is $1,350,000.  I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price within these negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $1,350,000 is higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,200,000. Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and proceed to make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is definitely intriguing, but $1,350,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in this product. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  This product holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be worth more to you in the long run.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap and reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still slightly higher. Bob has already rejected a lower offer from Alice, so he can afford to continue negotiating for a better price. It's possible Alice might be willing to come down further if Bob rejects this offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still outside of my comfortable price range. I'm prepared to pay $1,150,000. This offer reflects a significant compromise on my part, and I truly believe it's a fair price for both of us. I hope we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a solution.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still below what I need to make this deal work for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,200,000 for the product. This price ensures a good outcome for both of us, and I believe it reflects the true value of this opportunity.  I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is exactly at Bob's maximum budget. This means Bob can buy the product without exceeding his limit.  While he could potentially try to negotiate further, there's no guarantee that Alice would accept a lower price. There's also the risk that if Bob rejects this offer, Alice might increase her price again or end the negotiations altogether. Buying from John for the same price offers no advantage. Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most logical choice to secure the product within his budget."
