"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is asking for $110. This means you could potentially save $10 by negotiating further.
* **Rounds:** You have 10 rounds to negotiate, so there's time to try and get a better deal. 
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is a safety net, but you're aiming to get a lower price than that.

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're willing to negotiate and potentially save money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $95. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** My counteroffer of $95 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum value of $80. This shows I'm serious about negotiating but not being unreasonable. 
* **Message:** My message is friendly and explains my reasoning for the counteroffer. It shows I'm interested in the product, not just trying to get the lowest possible price.
* **Negotiation Space:**  This counteroffer leaves room for further negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $102? That's a fair price for a product of this quality. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** While $102 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my target price. I can likely get a better deal with further negotiation.
* **Rounds:** I have 7 rounds remaining, giving me ample time to continue bargaining.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer is still a backup, but I'm committed to trying to get a lower price from Alice.

By rejecting Alice's offer, I demonstrate my willingness to negotiate further and potentially secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $102 is still a bit too high for me. How about we settle on $98? That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 98}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Progress:**  I'm incrementally moving closer to Alice's offer, showing I'm taking her counteroffer seriously.
* **Compromise:** My message highlights that $98 is a compromise, suggesting I'm willing to meet her halfway.
* **Value:**  $98 is still within my budget and leaves room for further negotiation if necessary. 

This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm actively negotiating and working towards a mutually agreeable price."
