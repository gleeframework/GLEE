"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  This is my maximum price point, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer and honesty about your valuation. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand you see the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the unique aspects of what I'm offering.  What do you think?",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
