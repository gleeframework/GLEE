Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $2,300,000 is far above my budget. Given my research and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $800,000 for it.  This is my maximum price point, and I'm confident it's a fair offer for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer and honesty about your valuation. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand you see the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the unique aspects of what I'm offering.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1900000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,900,000 is still too high for me.  Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

While Bob is coming up in price, it's unlikely he'll reach my minimum. It's more profitable to take John's guaranteed offer."
