"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Alice's offer is far too high. It's more than double your maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer and counter-offering is the best strategy to try and get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer and honesty about your valuation. While $800,000 is too low for me to consider, I understand you see the product's value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This feels like a fair compromise, reflecting the unique aspects of what I'm offering.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Alice's offer of $1,900,000 is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $800,000.  Rejecting the offer and making another counteroffer gives you a chance to negotiate further and potentially get closer to your desired price."
