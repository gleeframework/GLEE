Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but leaving room for negotiation.  This should give me a good starting point and see if Bob is willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum value of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm lowering my price from the initial offer, but still keeping it above my minimum value. This shows flexibility while also indicating that I'm serious about making a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $100 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'm willing to continue negotiating for a better price before resorting to selling to John."

I'm making one final counteroffer, slightly lower than my previous one. This is a compromise, showing that I'm willing to meet him halfway but also still wanting to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go any higher, and I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum value. To ensure I don't lose out entirely, I'll sell to John for the guaranteed $150."
