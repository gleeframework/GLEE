As we get started, I'd like to make you a fair offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential. However, I think $1,100,000 is a little steep for me right now.  Would you consider a price closer to $900,000?
