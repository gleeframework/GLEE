"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make you a fair offer of $1,100,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm willing to make some concessions, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $975,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to think about my own interests. I can offer you the product for $1,015,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,015,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Alice is clearly unwilling to budge significantly from her price.  She's down to $1,015,000, and while she might go a tiny bit lower, it's unlikely to be worth the risk of continued negotiation. 

You have a guaranteed offer from John at $1,000,000. Taking that offer saves you money and avoids the potential of Alice holding firm and forcing you to either accept a higher price or walk away with nothing."
