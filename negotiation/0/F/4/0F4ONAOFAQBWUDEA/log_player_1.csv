Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $150 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $175.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 175}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $160

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $160 is still a little too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. Let's do $165. It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 165}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again. However, $165 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $155, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I would ideally prefer a bit more, $155 is a good price and I'm running out of rounds. There's a risk of Bob walking away or me being forced to sell to John for $150."
