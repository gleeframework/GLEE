Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,200,000 and $1,500,000.

**Strategy**

You want to offer a price that's attractive enough for Bob to accept, but also maximizes your profit.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability can encourage a quicker decision.
* **Confidence:** Highlighting your belief in the product's value reinforces its worth.
* **Price Point:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's a significant profit above Bob's perceived value ($150,000 more) but still below your guaranteed price from John.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If a long-term business relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate initial offer might be preferable. 

**After the Offer**

Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer or negotiate.  Having John's offer as a backup gives you a strong position to walk away if necessary."
