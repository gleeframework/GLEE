{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500.  It's a great deal, and I think it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $11,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** This leaves room for you to negotiate down without dropping below your minimum.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** The message is friendly but direct, clearly stating the offer and asking for a response.

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $10,800 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,800 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob to see if we can reach a more agreeable price.  If he refuses to budge, selling to John is the next best option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 11200} 
``` 

This counteroffer:

* **Shows flexibility:**  It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:**  It's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Keeps the pressure on:**  It emphasizes the value of the product and encourages Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,200. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price. If he rejects this offer, I'll sell to John."
