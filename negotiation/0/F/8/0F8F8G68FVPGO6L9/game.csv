"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $11,200.  That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for considering my previous offer and coming down to $11,200. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay that much. I'm willing to pay $10,900 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",10900.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,900 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,000, which is a final offer.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a good deal.  Let me know if you're ready to close this deal.",11000.0,Alice,5,
