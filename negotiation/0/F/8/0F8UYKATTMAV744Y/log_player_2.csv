{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob's goal is to save money. Since Alice's offer is above Bob's maximum price, rejecting the offer is the logical first step.  Bob should try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get a good deal.  He's offering $7,500, which is $500 below his maximum price. This shows Alice he's serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if needed."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is still above Bob's maximum price point. It is risky to buy from John as there is no guarantee that he will still be selling the product later. Bob should continue negotiating with Alice, hoping for a better offer."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is now within Bob's budget, making it a worthwhile deal. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a lower price, but there is no guarantee, and Bob could potentially lose the deal altogether. Given the limited rounds, it's more advantageous to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
