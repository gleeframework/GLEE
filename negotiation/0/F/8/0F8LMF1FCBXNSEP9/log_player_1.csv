Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price point.  However, I'm still not convinced $875,000 accurately reflects the product's value to you.

Bob's offer of $890,000 is getting very close to my target price, and we're only a few rounds away from selling to John for a significantly lower amount. It's time to take the deal and secure a profit."
