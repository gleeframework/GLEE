"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 doesn't reflect the true value of the product for you.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows us to make this deal happen.",925000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've given this some thought and I'm willing to consider your offer. However, I think we can work towards a price closer to $875,000. I believe this would be a fair compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming closer to my price point.  However, I'm still not convinced $875,000 accurately reflects the product's value to you.  Let's meet in the middle at $900,000.  This price offers a significant gain for you, and I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,5,
