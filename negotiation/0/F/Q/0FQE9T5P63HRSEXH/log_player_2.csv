"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her minimum value, but it's still within your budget. It's likely you can get a better price by negotiating.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a deal closer to Alice's minimum value."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to your counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting, you can continue to push for a lower price. You could even offer something slightly higher than your previous counteroffer, signaling you're serious about getting a deal but still want to save money."
