"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity, I'm looking to pay a bit less.  Considering the product's value, I'm willing to offer $1,150,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's value is closer to my initial price.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  While $1,250,000 is closer, I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,200,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can finalise the deal.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
