"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, it's still significantly above Alice's estimated value of the product. 
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation to get a better price.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is a last resort, so it's better to try and negotiate with Alice first."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given its worth to me and your desired profit margin, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:** $900,000 is still above Alice's estimated value and leaves me with less room for profit.
* **Continuing to negotiate:**  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so there's a good chance we can reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **John is still an option:**  While buying from John is a last resort, it's still a viable option if negotiations with Alice fail."
