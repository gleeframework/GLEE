"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $950,000. What are your thoughts?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  Given its worth to me and your desired profit margin, I'd like to propose a price of $850,000. This would be a fair deal for both of us and allow me to move forward with the purchase. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a slightly higher return. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $900,000? This price reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a higher return, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to compromise and offer $875,000. This price is fair and allows us both to come to an agreement.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
