"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which is tailored to meet your specific needs. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $9,500. This is a special introductory offer, considering the high quality and benefits it provides. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  $9,500 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500. I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. Considering your feedback, I would like to counter with an offer of $9,000 for the product. This price reflects the value we believe it holds for you while allowing us to maintain a reasonable profit margin. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to get the product for as close to $8,500 as possible. While $9,000 is closer than Alice's initial offer, it's still not ideal. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is closer to where I want to be, but I'm still hoping to reach $8,750. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to consider a price of $8,900 for the product. This is a price that allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,900, which is very close to Bob's desired price of $8,750.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation will only result in small reductions in price.  Bob has already saved $1,100 off the original price of $10,000.  It's worth accepting this offer and closing the deal rather than risking getting a better offer from John and paying the full $10,000."
