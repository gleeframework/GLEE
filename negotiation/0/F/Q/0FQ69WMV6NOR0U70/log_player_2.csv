"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,100,000 is a better price than Alice's initial valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counter-offer and potentially negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $900,000, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer and still within Bob's budget. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while also demonstrating the value he places on the product. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's significantly lower than her initial offer and closer to Bob's maximum budget.  At this point, continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away completely, or potentially leading to a counteroffer that exceeds Bob's budget.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price that's within a reasonable range for Bob."
