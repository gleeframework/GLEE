"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase a valuable product that I believe will be highly beneficial for your business.  My asking price is $950,000. This price reflects the significant value and potential of the product. I'm confident that this deal will be mutually advantageous. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer is too high. You can get the product for $1,000,000 from John, so there's no need to pay more than that. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially propose a lower price, closer to your desired range."
