"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $20,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $12,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $12,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  How about $10,000? That's a significant amount and demonstrates my serious interest in the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $10,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $12,000, so I'll offer it to you for $11,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
