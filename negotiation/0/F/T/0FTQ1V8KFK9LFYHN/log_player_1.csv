Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $15,500. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 15500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message subtly implies the product's value might increase if listed publicly, giving Bob an incentive to act quickly.
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob counters, the offer leaves space to negotiate downwards while still staying above your $12,000 minimum.
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to sell below that price."
