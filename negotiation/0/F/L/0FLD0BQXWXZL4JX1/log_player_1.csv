Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. This is a fair price, considering it's worth $1,200,000 to me.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I'm going to try to negotiate a better price with Bob."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,150,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,125,000. This would be a good compromise, and we can finalize the deal.  Let me know what you think.

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  I'm not confident I can get him to go higher, and I don't want to risk losing too much time on this negotiation. John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price. It's in my best interest to sell to John now and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
