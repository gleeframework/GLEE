"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, it's still more than you'd like to pay.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my ideal range.  This is likely to be rejected, but it sets the stage for further negotiations."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$130 is still too high. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, aiming for a price closer to $100.  The risk of failing to reach a deal is still less than buying from John at $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise.  However, I'm still significantly below Alice's last offer.  This should keep the negotiations moving towards a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my ideal price than previous offers, I still have rounds left to negotiate. I'm going to continue attempting to get a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice seems to be coming down in price. I'm now willing to meet her halfway on her latest offer, which should keep negotiations moving forward."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's price is still above what I'm willing to pay, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I have several rounds left and can still try to negotiate a lower price. Buying from John at $150 is still a worse option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has risen again, but we are in the latter half of our rounds. I'm going to make one more counteroffer close to my last offer.  I'm confident Alice will accept this offer as it's closer to her previous offer. If not, I will likely buy from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer has gone back up to $145.  With only one round remaining, the chances of getting a better price are slim.  At this point, buying from John for $150 is the more rational choice.  While it's not ideal, it guarantees I get the product without risking further negotiation failure."
