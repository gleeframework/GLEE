,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. I'd be happy to buy the product for $90. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $105. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in the product but $105 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $95.  Let's find a price that works for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $95 is still a bit below what I'm looking for. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to sell for $100. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's a good deal for both of us. What do you say?",100.0,Alice,5,
