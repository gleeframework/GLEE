Round 2

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  While I'm happy with $10,000, I'm hoping to get closer to my asking price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my original asking price.  How about $11,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows me to make a profit while still giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am still interested in purchasing your product, but I am unable to go above $10,500. I hope this meets in the middle for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. $10,500 is a good compromise and it's closer to my original asking price than John's offer.  I'm confident I can find another buyer if I need to in the future."
