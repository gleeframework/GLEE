Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Alice knows Bob values the product at $800,000 and she has a guaranteed sale at that price.  Starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits,"" Alice aims to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value above $800,000.
* **Confidence:** The message is framed confidently, without appearing desperate. This can subtly influence Bob's perception of the offer.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Market research:**  Ideally, Alice should have a sense of typical price ranges for similar products. This would inform a more strategic opening offer.
* **Bob's personality:** If Alice knows Bob is a tough negotiator, a slightly lower starting point might be wiser to avoid turning him away completely. 
* **Risk tolerance:**  A higher offer carries the risk of Bob rejecting it outright. Alice needs to weigh this against the potential reward."
