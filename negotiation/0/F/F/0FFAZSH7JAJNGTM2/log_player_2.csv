You've reached a point where you're very close to your target price but Alice's offer is still a little higher.  At this point, it's likely that you'll need to make a counteroffer that is below your desired price or Alice will keep increasing her offers to get closer to the $120 value of the product to her.  You only have one round left, so it's better to go with John's offer and save yourself the hassle of further negotiation."
