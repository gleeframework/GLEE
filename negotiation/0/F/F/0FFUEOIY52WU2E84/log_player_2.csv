"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a better price.  You can counteroffer and see if you can get closer to your $80 target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This still gives you a good deal, and I can avoid selling to someone else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $100 is a good deal, considering the product is worth $80 to you. It's a good compromise, and you'll still be saving $20 compared to buying from John."
