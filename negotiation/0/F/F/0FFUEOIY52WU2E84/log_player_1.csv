Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer allows for some room for negotiation, as it's above Bob's value but still below my minimum. This strategy aims to maximize profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but $110 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $90 is too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $100? This still gives you a good deal, and I can avoid selling to someone else."", ""product_price"": 100} 
```"
