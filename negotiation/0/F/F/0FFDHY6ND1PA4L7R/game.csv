"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the unique value of this product, $2000000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is my maximum offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the potential value of the product to me. Let me know if you're open to negotiating further.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm counteroffering at $1450000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1450000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1450000 is still a bit out of reach for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1200000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this point.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth it.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
