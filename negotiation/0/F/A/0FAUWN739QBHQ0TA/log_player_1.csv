"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than what Bob values the product at, but still less than what I'm willing to accept from John. This leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what I value the product at. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still keeping it well above Bob's offer. I'm hoping to find a middle ground and reach a deal without having to resort to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'm going to continue negotiating in hopes of getting a higher offer from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm going to try a slightly lower counteroffer, as we're getting closer to a potential deal. This price is still well above Bob's last offer, but shows a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're getting very close to my minimum, but with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming risky to continue negotiating with Bob. John offers a guaranteed profit, and it's not worth the risk of ending up with a lower price than I'm willing to accept. I'm going to sell to John."
