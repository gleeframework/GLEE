,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1200000 is a bit too low for me at this point. How about we meet in the middle at $1350000? I believe this price reflects the value of the product while still being fair to both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
