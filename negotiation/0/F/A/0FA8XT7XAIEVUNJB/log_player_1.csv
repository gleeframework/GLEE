Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($120) as possible without going below my minimum ($150).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 allows for some potential haggling if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.  
* **Time Pressure:**  Adding a sense of urgency (""limited time"") might encourage Bob to act quickly.

**It's a delicate balance:** If I go too high, Bob will reject the offer outright. If I go too low, I miss out on potential profit. This offer aims to find that sweet spot."
