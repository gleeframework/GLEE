Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I open it up to other buyers. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth significantly exceeds your initial valuation. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a strong offer that leans towards your ideal outcome. This leaves room for potential negotiation.
* **Highlighting Value:** Emphasizing the product's value exceeding Bob's valuation might make him more amenable to a higher price.
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning other buyers incentivizes Bob to act quickly and potentially agree to a higher price to avoid missing out.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The offer is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but lower than John's, providing space for a mutually beneficial agreement."
