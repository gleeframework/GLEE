"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $11,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
