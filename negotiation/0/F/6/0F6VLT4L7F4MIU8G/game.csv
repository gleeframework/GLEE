"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I believe you'll find it worth every penny. My initial offer is $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for the product.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to negotiate, but $6,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering you a compromise of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $9,000 is still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're making progress, but $7,000 is still below my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to meet my minimum of $10,000. Let's aim for $8,500. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a little further, how about $7,500?  That's my final offer.",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to stretch your budget, Bob. However, $7,500 is still not meeting my minimum. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my target of $10,000. Let's aim for $9,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product's value and our previous discussions.",9000.0,Alice,7,
