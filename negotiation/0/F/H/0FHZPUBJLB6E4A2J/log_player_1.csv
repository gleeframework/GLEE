{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that is below Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also includes a friendly message to encourage Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $11,000? This still gives you a good price, and allows me to get closer to the value I need. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I'm still a bit hesitant about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $10,750? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is above my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It's also a good compromise, and I'm confident I can find another buyer at a similar price if I need to."
