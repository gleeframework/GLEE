Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000.  This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see how Bob responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $12,000 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

I'm going to counteroffer with $13,500. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway from his last offer. It allows for further negotiation while still being above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

Bob is holding firm at $12,000. While I'd prefer more, it's a decent offer and significantly better than selling to John. Accepting this offer will allow me to avoid further negotiation and secure a good profit."
