# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit your endeavors. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $13,000 for it. This price reflects the significant worth the product holds for you while ensuring a fair return for us. Please let me know if this offer suits your budget and needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $15,000 and is still a good deal for you since the product is worth $15,000 to you.  While you could buy from John for $15,000, it's more beneficial to save $2,000 by accepting Alice's offer."
