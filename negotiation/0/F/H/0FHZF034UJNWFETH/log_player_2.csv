Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. What do you think?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,500 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,200. It's a good deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

It's time to cut our losses. Alice is very slowly lowering her price, and it's unlikely she'll go below $10,000. John offers a guaranteed price of $10,000, which is the best we can realistically hope for in this negotiation."
