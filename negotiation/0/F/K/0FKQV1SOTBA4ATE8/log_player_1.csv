"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's initial interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. While I'm open to negotiation, I can't accept such a low price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still significantly higher than Bob's. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that's appealing to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum value, it's still not ideal. I'm going to reject this offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round.  I have a few more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and selling to John for $10,000 is still a viable option if I don't see a better offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. I'm starting to get closer to Bob's price point, but I'm still holding out for a little more.  I'm hoping this compromise will be appealing to Bob, and we can finally reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,500 is above my minimum value of $10,000. It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing this sale by continuing to negotiate.  While I could potentially get a slightly higher price, there's no guarantee I'll be successful.  I'm going to accept this offer and secure the sale."
