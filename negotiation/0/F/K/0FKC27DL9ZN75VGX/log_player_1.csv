"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $8,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not comfortable going above $9,000. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Bob is unlikely to move much higher than $9,000.  Selling to John for $10,000 is a sure thing and ensures I don't lose potential profit by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
