""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 to John, it's always best to aim higher initially. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it slightly below our minimum ($1,500,000) won't be enticing. Offering it significantly above his valuation ($1,450,000) creates a sense of negotiation room but keeps us well within a profitable margin.
* **First-mover Advantage:**  By offering Bob the first opportunity, we might secure a sale quickly and avoid potential delays associated with going to John.

**Important Considerations:**

* This is just an opening offer. Bob might negotiate, and we need to be prepared to adjust our price slightly. 
* There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, with John as a backup, we're not in a desperate position."
