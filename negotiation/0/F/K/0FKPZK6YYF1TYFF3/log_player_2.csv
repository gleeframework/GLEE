# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John is offering. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save $800,000."
