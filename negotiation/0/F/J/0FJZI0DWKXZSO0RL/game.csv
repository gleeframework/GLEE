"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer! I really appreciate your enthusiasm, but $90 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $82. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $82 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $78 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $78 is a good offer, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and sell the product to you for $80.50. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
