Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product for $1,400,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'd like to close the deal, $1,250,000 is too low. I want to see if I can get closer to my asking price before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $1,250,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly, let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would allow both of us to reach a fair agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer a higher price, $1,300,000 is a decent compromise and a better outcome than selling to John for $1,500,000."
