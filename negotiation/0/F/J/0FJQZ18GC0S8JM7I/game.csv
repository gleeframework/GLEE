"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget constraint. However, $1,250,000 is simply too far below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down slightly, let's meet in the middle at $1,325,000. It's still a good deal for you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my range.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,300,000?  This would allow both of us to reach a fair agreement.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
