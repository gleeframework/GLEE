"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. Given its features and value, I'm offering it at $22,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's better to reject and make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $22,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 right now. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is significantly below its value.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $18,000 is closer to my budget, it's still too high. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can get closer to a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $18,000 is still out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $13,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value I see in the product."", ""product_price"": 13000}
