"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $115. Given its value to you, I believe this price strikes a good balance between maximizing my earnings and ensuring you find a fair deal. Looking forward to your response! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer of $115 is tempting, you can do better. You know John will sell it to you for $120. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of her lowering the price further or sticking to your backup plan with John."
