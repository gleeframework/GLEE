Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $100 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to get the product for a bit less than $95. How about we settle on $92? I'm really hoping we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 92}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $93. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $93
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $93 is still above your target price of $120, but it's within a reasonable range, and we're already five rounds in.  Accepting this offer means you're getting the product for a price that's better than buying from John, and you're also likely to finalize the deal quicker.  It's a good compromise to save time and secure the product."
