Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation while ensuring we don't leave money on the table.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of scarcity and urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly. 
* **Backup plan:** We have a secure offer from John at $800,000, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while keeping Bob's valuation in mind. If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still room to negotiate downwards or accept John's offer as a reliable fallback."
