{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the significant return on investment you'll gain."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Aiming for the highest possible price maximizes potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate, potentially still landing within a very profitable range. 
* **John as Backup:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides a safety net. There's no risk in aiming high with Bob. 

**The offered price of $1,100,000 is strategic because:**

* **Attractive to Bob:** It's significantly less than Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), making it a potentially very good deal.
* **Highly Profitable for Alice:** It's well above Alice's minimum acceptable price ($800,000), ensuring a substantial profit."
