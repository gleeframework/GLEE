You can do better than $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."

I'm offering $10,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer and still leaves room for both of us to make a profit."

Alice is increasing the price, but it's still not a good deal for me. I'll counteroffer again."

I'm raising my offer to $11,000,  which is a compromise between our previous offers. It's still a good price for me, and hopefully, Alice sees the value in reaching an agreement."

Alice keeps increasing the price, and I'm not willing to go higher. It's better to buy from John at $15,000 than to risk getting stuck with an even higher price from Alice."
