Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $900,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not so high that it's likely to be immediately rejected. I'm hoping to start the negotiation and see what Bob's counteroffer will be."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than what the product is worth to me.  I'm going to reject it and counteroffer with a higher price. I want to see if I can reach a compromise closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is a compromise between my initial asking price and Bob's offer. It's still above the value of the product to Bob, but closer to his offer. I'm hoping this will incentivize him to continue negotiating and potentially reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $800,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product. While I'd prefer to get more, accepting this offer ensures I don't lose out on any potential profit. It's also a better outcome than selling to John for the same price, as it avoids any further negotiation and ensures the sale."
