"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you consider $145? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",145.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $145 is a bit too low for me.  How about $160? It's still a good deal for you, and it lets me cover my costs.",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $160 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend. How about $155?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I can get the product without going over budget.",155.0,Bob,4,
