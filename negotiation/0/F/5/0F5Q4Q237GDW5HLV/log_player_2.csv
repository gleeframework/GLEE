"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $12,000 is a good price, there's potential to get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A significant counteroffer of $10,000 shows Alice he's serious about negotiating, but it's still a fair price if the product is truly worth $12,000 to her. This strategy creates room for negotiation without immediately ending the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her original price of $12,000 to $11,000.  This is a decent saving for Bob, and  he's likely to get a better deal than John's $15,000 offer.  It's risky to keep negotiating as there's no guarantee Alice will go lower, and Bob could end up paying more.  Accepting the $11,000 offer is the most logical choice in this situation."
