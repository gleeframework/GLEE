"Bob, I understand you have a budget, and I'm willing to negotiate. However, $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a fair price that gives us both a good deal. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both of us. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows me to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
