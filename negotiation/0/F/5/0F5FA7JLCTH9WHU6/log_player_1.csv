"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, aiming to maximize my profit.  Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm hoping to gauge his interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. I'll be prepared to lower the price if necessary, but I want to see how far I can push it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $15,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not eager to sell at that price.  I'm going to try to get a better deal with Bob. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $18,000.  This is still a good profit for me, and it might be tempting enough for Bob to accept.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground where we can both be happy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has moved closer to my desired price, and I'm comfortable with a $1,000 profit. It's better than selling to John, and I don't want to risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower offer or running out of rounds."
