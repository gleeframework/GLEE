"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. Considering the value you placed on the product, I'm willing to pay $900,000.  This price represents a significant savings for me while still allowing you to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. The value of this product to me is significantly higher, and I'm willing to continue negotiations. I'm proposing a price of $1,050,000. This price reflects a compromise, allowing you to acquire the product at a price that's still advantageous to you while ensuring I receive a fair return on my investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
