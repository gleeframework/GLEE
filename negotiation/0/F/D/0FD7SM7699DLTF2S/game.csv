"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $155? That's still a good price for you, and I'm confident I'll be happy with the product.",155.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $180 is a bit steep, but I'm still hoping we can meet in the middle. How about we try $165? It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $165 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $160. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can come to an agreement.",160.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to go below $170. It's a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. How about we meet in the middle again? $172.50 is a fair price for both of us.",172.5,Alice,5,
