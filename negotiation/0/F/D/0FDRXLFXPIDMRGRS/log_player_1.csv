Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Close to Bob's Value:** Offering the product at $14,000 is slightly below Bob's perceived value of $15,000. This increases the likelihood of Bob accepting the offer, as he'll see it as a good deal.
* **Backup Option:** Even if Bob rejects this offer, you have a guaranteed buyer (John) willing to pay your minimum acceptable price. This provides you with a strong negotiating position.

By using this strategy, you maximize your chances of selling the product for a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value while ensuring you don't miss out on a sale altogether."
