Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115."", 
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I start with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value ($120) to aim for a higher profit margin. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $115 offer leaves space for potential counteroffers from Bob while staying above my minimum acceptable price ($100).
* **Alternative Buyer:** I'm aware I have John as a backup buyer, but I want to try for a better deal with Bob first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a deal, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $90 is significantly below both my minimum price ($100) and his own perceived value of the product ($120).  There's plenty of room for negotiation. I'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $90 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"", 
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  By suggesting $105, I'm aiming for a compromise. This price is halfway between Bob's offer ($90) and my initial asking price ($115).
* **Staying Above Minimum:** $105 ensures I make a profit and stay well above my $100 minimum.
* **Maintaining Negotiation:** This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open while still pushing for a price closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget with $105. How about we meet at $98? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $98 is still slightly below my ideal price, it's now close enough to my minimum acceptable price ($100) to warrant acceptance. 

* **Minimal Gains from Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield a dollar or two more, and there's a risk of Bob walking away.
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now means I secure the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations. 
* **Better Than Alternative:** $98 is still a better outcome than selling to John for $100."
