Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, considering Alice's goals:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers. Please let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a bit, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong Alternative:**  Alice has a strong fallback option with John at $1,200,000. This gives her leverage in the negotiation, as she doesn't *need* to go lower than $1,200,000.
* **Confident Tone:** The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value and presenting the offer as a good opportunity for Bob."
