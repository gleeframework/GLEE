Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available to others. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Positioning:** Starting at $1,150,000 leaves room for negotiation while still staying above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Exclusivity Incentive:** Highlighting that this is an exclusive offer before going to someone else (John) might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer.
* **Open Communication:** The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob to share his thoughts and potentially counter-offer. This keeps the negotiation open."
