Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. This product would be worth a maximum of $1,000,000 to me.  I'd be willing to start the negotiations at $700,000.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob might be willing to go slightly higher, it's unlikely he'll reach our $1,000,000 walk-away point in the remaining rounds.  He's drawn a line in the sand.  John offers a guaranteed $1,000,000, ensuring we don't lose money by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  It's time to take the sure thing."
