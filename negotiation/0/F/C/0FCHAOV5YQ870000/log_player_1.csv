While I could push for a bit more, Bob is consistently moving closer to my price and we are in round 6 out of 10. Accepting his offer of $940,000 secures a significant profit above my minimum.  It's better to take a sure win at this point rather than risk him walking away or getting stuck in a protracted negotiation."
