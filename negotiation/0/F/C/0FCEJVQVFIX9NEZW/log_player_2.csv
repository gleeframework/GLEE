Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 is your limit, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that low. I'll meet you halfway between $120 and $130, which is $125. That's the best I can do.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125

Alice is very unlikely to go below $125. It's not worth continuing the negotiation and risking paying more when you can get the product for your target price from John."
