"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a high-quality item that has been highly regarded by previous buyers. I believe it would be a great addition to your collection. For this exceptional piece, I am offering it to you for $140. I hope we can come to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good deal, you can likely get the product for less.  You are willing to pay up to $120, and it's worth $150 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you highlighting the product's quality. I'm really interested, but my budget is a bit tighter than that. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 125}
