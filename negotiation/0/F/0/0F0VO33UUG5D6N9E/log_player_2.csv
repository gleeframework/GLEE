"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $18000, which I believe is a fair and reasonable price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000. It's a good idea to reject this offer and move on to counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is far above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $8,000. This is my maximum offer, considering the value I place on this product."", ""product_price"": 8000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8000 is your maximum offer, but I'm not willing to sell at that price. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is still above your budget, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer and sending a counteroffer will continue to demonstrate your interest in the product while trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still out of my price range. I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, and I'm willing to offer $9,500. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. However, $9500 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is still too high for Bob.  While she is showing willingness to negotiate, the price remains outside Bob's budget. With only 5 rounds remaining, it is more beneficial for Bob to purchase the product from John for $8,000. This secures the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation that may not lead to a successful outcome."
