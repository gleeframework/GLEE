"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me. How about $110? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $130. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $125. This is my final offer.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $135. I've already compromised a lot, and I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,5,
