I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  $90 is too low."

Round 3

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $95, I feel I can still get closer to my desired price.  I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
