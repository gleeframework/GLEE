Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could both benefit from.
* **One Shot:** You only get one chance to make an offer to Bob.

**Strategy**

You want to find a price that:

1. **Maximizes your profit:**  Aim as high as possible without deterring Bob.
2. **Remains attractive to Bob:** Ensure Bob sees value in the deal compared to not buying.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its unique value proposition, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly exceptional."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,150,000 captures a significant portion of the potential surplus ($150,000 for you, $50,000 savings for Bob).
* **Justification:**  The message subtly emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" hinting at the product's worth without explicitly revealing Bob's potential maximum.
* **Exclusivity:**  The phrase ""exclusive opportunity"" adds a touch of urgency and desirability.

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances maximizing your potential gain with a good chance of securing a deal that benefits both parties."
