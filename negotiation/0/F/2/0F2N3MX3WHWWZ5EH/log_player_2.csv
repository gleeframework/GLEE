"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the transaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is offering the product for $13,500, while John is asking for $15,000. 
* **You still save money:** Even though the product is worth $15,000 to you, you can get it for $1,500 less from Alice."
