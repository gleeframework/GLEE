"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in.  It's valued at $15,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.  That's a significant savings for you, and a good deal for me.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her stated value, you know you can get the product for significantly less ($8,000) from John.  There's no need to settle for a higher price."
