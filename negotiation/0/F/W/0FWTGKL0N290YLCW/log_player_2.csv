"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for a great price. How about $125? Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While $125 is more than Alice's value of $100, it's still cheaper than John's offer of $150.
* **You value the product at $150:** This means you're willing to pay up to $150 for it, making Alice's offer a good deal."
