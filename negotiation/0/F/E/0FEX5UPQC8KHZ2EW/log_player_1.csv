Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $19,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Start high:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you can afford to start negotiations higher with Bob.
* **Leave room for negotiation:**  Offering it at $19,000 leaves space for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping you well above your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Create a sense of urgency:**  Mentioning a ""limited-time offer"" might encourage Bob to make a decision faster and potentially accept a higher price. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you don't know Bob's financial limits or negotiation tactics. 
* Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response and any information you gather during the negotiation."
