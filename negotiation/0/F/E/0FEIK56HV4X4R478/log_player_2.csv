Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $9,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a little over my budget. I'm willing to go to $8,750.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8750}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I understand your budget constraints and I'm glad we're able to keep the discussion going. Based on our previous negotiations, I would like to suggest a price of $8,900 for the product. This is a fair compromise that allows us to move forward with the transaction. I hope you find this proposal acceptable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,900 is very close to my counteroffer of $8,750.  At this point, I'm not sure I can push for a lower price, and the risk of her rejecting my counteroffer and possibly raising her price again is too high. Accepting her offer is the best option for me to secure the product at a decent price within my budget."
