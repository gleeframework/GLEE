"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget for this is a bit lower. How about we settle around $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on this valuable product. Let's meet in the middle at $1,250,000. This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to maintain a reasonable profit margin.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
