Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Would you be willing to consider this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is significantly less than my minimum value of $1,200,000.  I'm confident I can do better, so I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."

Bob's offer:

You have three options:

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While I appreciate Bob's effort to negotiate, his offer of $950,000 is still below my minimum threshold of $1,200,000. I will make one more counteroffer to Bob before considering selling to John."

Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other interested parties."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

I've made several concessions, but Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm tired of negotiating with him and am confident that I can get a better price from John. Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
