"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $900000 is simply too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $1300000. This still gives you a great price while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to find common ground here. I'm willing to make one final concession - $1100000. This is my absolute lowest price, and it's still well above your last offer. If you're serious about buying, this is your last chance to make a deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other interested parties.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
