"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $14,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $14,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product from John for $8,000.  There's no reason to accept a deal that's significantly higher than his alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $14,000 is far too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, which is a fair price considering my budget.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,500 is a bit low considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer $11,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is better than her initial offer, it's still above his budget. He can get the product from John for $8,000, so it makes more sense to continue negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $11,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'll offer $9,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer $10,500. Let's see if we can meet in the middle this time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $10,500 is closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he can get from John. He has time for further negotiation, and there's a chance he can get a better deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  How about we settle on $10,000?  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize the deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counteroffer $11,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```
