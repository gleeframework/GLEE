"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset that will bring significant returns on investment. I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good, but not great.** It's a 10% discount from the product's value to Alice. This suggests there's room for negotiation.
* **There's time for more negotiation.**  There are 9 more rounds, which gives Bob the opportunity to try and get a lower price. 
* **John's offer is the fallback option.** It's important to remember that John's offer is always available, but it's not the ideal outcome.

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob signals that he's willing to negotiate and aims to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but not unreasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but still leaves room for compromise.
* **Demonstrates willingness to negotiate:** It shows Bob is serious about buying the product but wants a better deal.
* **Focuses on finding a win-win:** The message emphasizes reaching a price that benefits both parties. 

This counteroffer sets the stage for further negotiation while leaving enough space for Bob to potentially secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects its value and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle is a good compromise:** Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, and this price is only a small amount more than Bob's counteroffer.
* **Time is running out:**  We are only in Round 3, and  each round brings us closer to having to buy from John, which is the least ideal outcome. 
* **The price is within Bob's budget:**  The offered price is well below Bob's maximum, leaving him a good margin of profit.

Accepting the offer at this point balances the potential for a slightly lower price with the risk of losing the deal to another buyer or getting stuck with the more expensive option from John."
