"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $10,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",11000.0,Alice,3,
