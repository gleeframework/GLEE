,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $9,000 is a bit lower than I was expecting. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value.",13000.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're continuing the conversation, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $14,000. This is my best price for now.",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $11,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that's reasonable for the product. I'm counteroffering at $14,500. This is my final compromise.",14500.0,Alice,7,

,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm surprised by your final offer, Bob. However, I'm not willing to accept $12,000. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm going to make one last stand at $14,000. This is my absolute final offer.",14000.0,Alice,9,
