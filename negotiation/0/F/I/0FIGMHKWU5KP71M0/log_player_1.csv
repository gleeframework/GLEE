"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

I'm starting high, at $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. It's important to remember that Bob values the product at $1,200,000, so he has some wiggle room to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,100,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  I'm also not ready to give up on the possibility of getting my asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm offering $1,300,000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, but it's still above my minimum price. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it.  I believe that it is a good compromise, as it demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profitable sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While I'm getting closer to my minimum price, $1,050,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept. I'm not desperate to sell, and I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob. It's important to note that I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob, considering he values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm offering $1,250,000. This is a further compromise from my previous offer. I'm getting closer to my minimum price, but I believe there's still room for Bob to move up a bit. This price also signals that I'm serious about closing the deal but won't settle for much less than my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable offer and accept it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he is getting closer to my minimum price, $1,025,000 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  We've been negotiating for several rounds, and I don't want to settle for a price that's significantly less than my desired amount. I have the option of selling to John for $1,200,000, so I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob for a little longer. I'm still hopeful that I can get a better price from Bob, considering he values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This is my final offer. I'm offering the product for my minimum price, $1,200,000. This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair price considering Bob also values it at $1,200,000. If Bob rejects this offer, I will immediately sell the product to John for $1,200,000. I don't have time for further negotiation, and I'm confident in the value of this product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

This time, I'm going to choose to sell the product to John. Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is still below my minimum price, and I've already made my final offer at $1,200,000.  I'm not willing to continue negotiating, and I'm not going to settle for a price less than my minimum.  John is willing to pay my minimum price, so it makes sense to sell to him and avoid further negotiation with Bob."
