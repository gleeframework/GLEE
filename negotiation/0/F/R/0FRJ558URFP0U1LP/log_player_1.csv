Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I think you'd really appreciate. I'm asking for $120 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's a good balance between trying to get a high price and being open to negotiation. I'm offering a price that's more than what I absolutely need, but still leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal.  

By giving a message along with the price, I'm opening the door for conversation and potentially building rapport with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a better price. Bob is clearly interested, and I know the product is worth more to him. By rejecting his offer, I can signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give away too much.  

I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to $100-$110."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a little low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $105? I'm sure we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm proposing a price that is a good compromise, and I'm including a message that shows I'm still willing to negotiate.  By offering $105, I'm aiming for a price that is still attractive to Bob while also getting closer to my target price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, Alice.  How about we settle at $98?  That's a fair compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$98 is a good price considering Bob's initial offer of $90.  It's closer to my target price of $100-$110 and would be a decent profit. I'm not sure I can get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal altogether by continuing to negotiate. Selling to John for $80 is also an option, but $98 is a more attractive offer."
