Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your lowest acceptable price.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  There's no overlap between your minimum and Bob's maximum. This means a successful negotiation requires you to either:
    *  Convince Bob the product is worth more. 
    *  Accept that Bob might reject your offer.

**Strategy**

Since you have a guaranteed buyer, it's in your best interest to aim high with Bob. There's a chance he might accept, and you'll make more profit.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it will bring to your operations."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but not outrageous:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's valuation but not entirely unreasonable.
* **Focus on value:** The message highlights the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high price.
* **Exclusivity:**  Creating a sense of scarcity and desirability might make Bob more receptive.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator or very price-sensitive, you might want to lower your offer slightly.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a slightly less aggressive approach might be beneficial.

**Remember:** This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and potentially lower your price if needed. However, always keep your $1,500,000 guarantee from John in mind."
