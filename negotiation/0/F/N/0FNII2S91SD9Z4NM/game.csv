"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd only be able to go up to $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $125 is a bit too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $145. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment. Let's close this deal! ",145.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $145 is still a bit above my budget.  How about we split the difference and settle on $135?  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement quickly.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $135 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can reach a price that's fair for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $140? It's a reasonable compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal. Let's make this happen!",140.0,Alice,5,
