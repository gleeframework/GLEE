Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's keep talking. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you is closer to my last offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to gain something valuable from this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  We're both clearly getting closer, though. Let's split the difference at $812,500. This would be a significant investment for you, but it would also ensure we both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  I'm truly confident in this product's potential for you, and I believe this price reflects that value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $812,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $812,500

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $800,000.  You've made good progress in the negotiation, but you have a guaranteed option with John at your target price. It makes more sense to buy from John and avoid the risk of Alice not going any lower."
