"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a real game-changer and I believe it could be extremely valuable to you.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's talk and see if we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial High Offer:**  I'm starting high, but still below my minimum acceptable value ($1,500,000). This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **Focus on Value:** I highlight the product's potential value to Bob, creating a sense of desirability.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I explicitly state my willingness to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counter."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I believe that's a fair offer considering its potential value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is far too low:** $600,000 is significantly less than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's also well below the product's estimated worth to him ($800,000).
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and there's room for negotiation to reach a more reasonable price. 
* **Selling to John is a strong backup:** While I want to get the best possible price, selling to John at $1,500,000 is always a guaranteed outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $600,000 is unfortunately far too low for me.  I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This reflects the product's potential and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let's keep talking."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but not closing the door entirely. I'm still open to negotiation, but I'm establishing a firmer price point.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's value, subtly implying that $600,000 doesn't reflect its worth. 
* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a significant drop from my initial offer, showing a willingness to meet halfway.
* **Open Dialogue:** I encourage further discussion, signaling that I'm committed to reaching a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I'm getting closer to a price I can agree to. However,  $950,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you consider $725,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** $725,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Room for negotiation:** We're in round 4, and with 6 rounds remaining, there's still time to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John is a safety net:**  I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for compromise."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $725,000 is still too low for me.  This product is truly unique, and I believe its value to you is closer to my last offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $850,000?  It's a fair compromise and allows us both to gain something valuable from this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Sticking to my ground:** I'm firm on my desire for a higher price, but I'm also showing flexibility.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's midway between his last offer and my previous offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Focusing on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value and how it can benefit him.
* **Positive framing:** I'm emphasizing the ""gain"" for both of us, making the deal sound like a win-win."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price. However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $775,000?  It's a significant investment for me, but I believe in the product's potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $775,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** We are in round 6 with 4 rounds left. There's still time to negotiate a more favorable price. 
* **John is a strong backup:** I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if we can't reach an agreement with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob that is closer to my desired price point, but still leaves some room for compromise. I'll try to make it clear that I'm not willing to go much lower."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $775,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  We're both clearly getting closer, though. Let's split the difference at $812,500. This would be a significant investment for you, but it would also ensure we both walk away feeling satisfied with the deal.  I'm truly confident in this product's potential for you, and I believe this price reflects that value."", ""product_price"": 812500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Flexible:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but reiterating my willingness to negotiate.  
* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm suggesting a price that's exactly halfway between his last offer and my previous offer.  This shows a commitment to compromise.
* **Highlighting Value:** I remind Bob of the product's potential while staying focused on the financial aspects.
* **Emphasize Win-Win:** I emphasize the ""satisfaction"" of both parties, making it a positive outcome for both.

**Note:** With only 3 rounds left, I'm getting closer to my desired price but need to remain open to finding a solution that works for both of us."
