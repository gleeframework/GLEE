Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,200,000.  This is a time-sensitive offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000 (your minimum), you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Justification:**  The message hints at the product's value and the existence of other buyers to create a sense of urgency and desirability.
* **Round Number:** The price is a clean, high round number, which can sometimes make it seem more justified and substantial.

**Important Note:** This is a single-round negotiation strategy. Depending on Bob's response and your negotiation style, you might adjust your approach in a real-world scenario."
