Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $130.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $130 allows some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price. 
* **Above Minimum:**  The price is comfortably above your minimum acceptable price ($100), ensuring a profit even if you need to negotiate down slightly.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still making the offer attractive enough for him to accept."
