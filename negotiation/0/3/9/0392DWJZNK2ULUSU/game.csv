"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's start from here and see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is quite a bit below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,750,000 is still above my budget. Let's try $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the potential value for me, and it gives us both room to make a deal.",1450000.0,Bob,4,
