I'm starting with a price of $1,500,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's well below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $1,200,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay this amount. If he rejects it again, I'll move on to selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still too low, even though it's closer to my minimum.  I'm not willing to risk further negotiation and potentially getting an even lower offer.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
