"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's much better to try and negotiate with Alice.  $20,000 is way above your budget and you have 9 more rounds to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a lower price, significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within my budget. This shows I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm also determined to get a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $18,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still above what I'm willing to pay. I have more rounds to negotiate and hopefully get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, showing I'm willing to compromise. However, I'm still under Alice's latest offer and getting closer to my ideal price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice is getting closer to my target price, but I'm still not ready to accept. I have several rounds left and I want to see if I can get her to go even lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm going all in with my final offer. This is the absolute maximum I'm willing to pay, as it's the same price as John's offer. I'm hoping Alice realizes I'm serious and accepts this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still not ready to accept. $16,500 is too high for me, especially since I have the option of buying from John for $15,000.  I'll try to negotiate further, as I only have 3 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15500}
```

I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but I'm still trying to stay below Alice's offer and get the best possible deal. This is my last chance before I have to decide between Alice and John."
