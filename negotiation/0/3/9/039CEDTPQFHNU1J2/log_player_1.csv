{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it leaves room for negotiation. It also demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product.  I'm hoping to get as close to my minimum price ($150) as possible, but I'm also willing to walk away and sell to John if Bob isn't interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $150.  While I appreciate his interest, I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  $120 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $160. That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $160 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $145 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $145 is very close to my minimum price of $150. While I'd love to get closer to that, I don't want to risk losing the sale completely.  Accepting his offer ensures I make a profit and don't have to deal with further negotiations."
