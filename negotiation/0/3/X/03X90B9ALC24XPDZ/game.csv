"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a deal that works for both of us,  $900,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me at $1,100,000? This price reflects the true value of the product.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $1,100,000 is still beyond my budget. I am willing to go up to $1,000,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
