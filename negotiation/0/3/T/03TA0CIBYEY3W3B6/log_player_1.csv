Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $125. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  While Bob values the product at $80, we don't want to start too low.  There's a chance he might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value, especially if it's a desirable item.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** Offering $125 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer. This keeps the conversation open and allows for some back and forth.
* **Above our minimum:** It's crucial that any offer exceeds our minimum selling price ($150 to John) to ensure we're making a profit."
