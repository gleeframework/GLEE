# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1200000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. It's a win-win situation, allowing you to acquire something worth $1500000 to you while I receive a substantial amount.  Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

```

**Explanation:**

* **Value to Bob:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Alice's Offer:**  Alice is offering the product for $1,200,000.
* **John's Price:** John is selling the product for $1,500,000.
