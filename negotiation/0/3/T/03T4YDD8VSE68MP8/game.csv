"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $12000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $10000 is a significant amount, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $13000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering its value to me. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I am still unable to meet you at $13000. I would like to propose $12000 as my maximum offer for the product.",12000.0,Bob,4,
