"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is still a great price for you, and it's closer to what the product is worth to me.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
