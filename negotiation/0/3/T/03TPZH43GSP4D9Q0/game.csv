"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that being said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  This is a fair price that allows us both to gain something from the transaction.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,325,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,325,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,300,000 for the product.  This is a significant move for me, and I'm confident we can find common ground at this price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a significant offer from you, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer to try to find a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $1,315,000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let's see if we can find a way to come to an agreement.",1315000.0,Alice,5,
