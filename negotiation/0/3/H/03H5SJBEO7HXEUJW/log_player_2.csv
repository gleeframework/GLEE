"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is less than what the product is worth to Alice, it's still above your maximum budget of $800,000. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially saving you more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is still above my budget. While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't drop further, or that the negotiation will drag on unnecessarily. Since I have a guaranteed deal with John for $800,000, it makes more sense to secure the product now and avoid further potential costs or delays."
