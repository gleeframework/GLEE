Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

I'll reject Bob's offer. $900,000 is still too low for me, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
