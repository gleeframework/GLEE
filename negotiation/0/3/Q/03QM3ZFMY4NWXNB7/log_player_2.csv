"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is better than $150 from John, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but it still leaves room for negotiation. It's a reasonable starting point, reflecting that you are willing to pay a fair price but also want a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $125 is a bit higher than my initial counteroffer of $105, but it's still a good deal compared to buying from John for $150.  I'm willing to accept this offer and avoid further negotiation."
