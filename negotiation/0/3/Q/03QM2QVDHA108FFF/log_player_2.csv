"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than his maximum budget of $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum. He should continue to negotiate with Alice and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a reasonable price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to consider a price of $9200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice has shown she's not willing to go much lower than $9,000, which is still over Bob's budget.  Since John is willing to sell for $8,000, Bob is better off buying from John and saving $1,200."
