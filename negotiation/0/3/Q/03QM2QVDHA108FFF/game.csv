"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a price of $12000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $8000 is your maximum budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $9500. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8500.  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to get a reasonable price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8500 is still a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to make another compromise. I'm willing to consider a price of $9200. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",9200.0,Alice,5,
