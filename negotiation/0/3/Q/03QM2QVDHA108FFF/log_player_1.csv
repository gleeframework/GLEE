Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $12000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8000 for it, which is my absolute maximum. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $8500.
