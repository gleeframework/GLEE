"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $7,000 is too low for me. I could meet you halfway at $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $8,500 is still a bit more than I'm ready to pay.  How about we meet at $8,200?  That's a good compromise, and I'm confident you'll still make a good deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
