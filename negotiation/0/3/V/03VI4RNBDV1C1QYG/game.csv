"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be a valuable asset to you. I'm initially offering it for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product, $15,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $10,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly lower than what I had in mind.  The value this product provides is substantial, and I'm confident it will benefit you greatly. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",11500.0,Bob,4,
