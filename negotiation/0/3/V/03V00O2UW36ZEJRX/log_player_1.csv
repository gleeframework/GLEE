{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's below Bob's perceived value of the product, giving him room to negotiate, but still a significant profit for you.  It also signals that you're serious about selling to him. 

We'll see how Bob responds, and then adjust our strategy based on his counteroffer. Remember, we have the option to walk away and sell to John for $1,000,000 if we feel like the negotiation isn't going in our favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  While we're open to negotiation,  $900,000 is significantly less than our minimum acceptable price. We'll counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to our initial offer. We can still make a profit and Bob is clearly interested in the product, so there's room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This is still a very good price for you, given the product's value, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise, showing Bob we're serious about selling to him while still remaining above our minimum threshold.  It's a significant move down from our initial offer, demonstrating flexibility while still protecting our interests. We'll see if this offer is acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,050,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'd like to make a compromise at $980,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $980,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we want to make a deal with Bob, we don't want to settle for a price that undervalues the product. We'll counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to our ideal outcome.  The fact that Bob is willing to negotiate shows that he's genuinely interested in the product, so there's still room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $980,000, but I'm still not quite there.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,015,000?  This gives us both a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1015000}
```

This counteroffer is a small move down from our previous offer but keeps us above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It shows that we're flexible but firm in our valuation of the product. We're also emphasizing the positive aspects of this price for both parties, aiming to incentivize Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to make a reasonable profit, but I'm still a bit above $1,015,000. I'd like to make a final offer of $990,000. This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's final offer of $990,000 is still below our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While we'd prefer to sell to Bob and potentially negotiate a higher price, we've reached a point where it's no longer worth the risk of further negotiation. 

We have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay our minimum price, so we'll choose to sell to John to ensure a secure and profitable outcome."
