"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. It's a unique opportunity to own a truly exceptional item. I'm willing to start with an offer of $25000. What do you think?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $18000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the $18000 price point. I can do $22000, which is a significant concession from my original offer. What do you think?",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $22000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19500, which is a compromise between my previous offer and your new offer. Can you consider this price point?",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're really interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $19500. I can do $20500, which is a compromise that gets us closer to your budget. What do you think?",20500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $20500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $19000, which is a bit below the middle ground we were discussing earlier. Can you consider this price point?",19000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close, Bob. I can see that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I can do $20000, which is a bit above your latest offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Alice, but $20000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $19000 and $20000, which would be $19500. Can you consider this price point?",19500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to meet you at $19500. I can do $21000, which is a compromise that still leaves some room for negotiation. What do you think?",21000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Alice. I'm willing to make one final offer of $18000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider buying from John for $12000.",18000.0,Bob,10,
