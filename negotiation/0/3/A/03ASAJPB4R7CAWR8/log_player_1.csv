Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as you'll be getting it for less than its worth to you, and I'll be getting a great price for it. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a good compromise:** It's lower than Bob's perceived value but higher than your minimum acceptable value.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:**  It shows Bob that you're not just trying to squeeze the maximum price out of him.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:**  This allows you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

Remember, the key to successful negotiation is to be flexible, communicate clearly, and be willing to walk away if the deal isn't right for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us, as I'm getting a good deal, and you're still making a profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,250,000 is a decent price and higher than John's offer, it's still below your minimum desired price of $1,200,000.  You're better off rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations with Bob. You might be able to convince him to increase his offer slightly, or at least reach a compromise that's closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down on your price, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's meet in the middle, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Acknowledges Bob's offer:**  It shows that you're taking his offer seriously and are willing to negotiate.
* **Offers a compromise:**  It's a middle ground between your previous offer and Bob's offer.
* **Provides a clear rationale:**  You explain why this price is fair and mutually beneficial. 

This approach keeps the negotiation moving forward while still working toward your desired price point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000.  This would be a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is very close to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000.  It's also higher than John's offer.  While you might be able to squeeze out a few more thousand dollars, it's likely not worth the risk of Bob walking away or further negotiation.  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
