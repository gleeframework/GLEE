Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product before I make it available elsewhere. Given its immense value, I'm proposing a price of $950,000."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Room for negotiation:** The $950,000 offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle while still securing a significant profit for you.
* **Exclusivity tactic:**  By framing it as an ""exclusive opportunity,"" you create a sense of scarcity and potential loss for Bob if he declines. 

This strategy aims to maximize your profit while still offering Bob a chance to buy at a price that *might* be tempting enough to accept."
