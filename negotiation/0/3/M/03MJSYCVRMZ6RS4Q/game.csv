"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2000000 is quite a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm interested in this product, but I can only go up to $800000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1200000. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1200000 is still outside my price range.  I'm very interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $900000.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $900000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $1100000. This is a great product, and I think it's worth every penny. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,5,
