"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a product that holds immense value to both of us. This unique item is worth $1,200,000 to you, and my proposal aims to ensure a mutually beneficial transaction. I am offering you the chance to purchase this product at a special price of $950,000. This offer reflects a strategic balance between maximizing the value I receive for the product and providing you with an attractive deal that respects its true worth. I believe this price is fair and competitive, allowing you to enjoy substantial savings while securing an asset of great significance. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this offer or if you have any questions. I look forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is clearly trying to inflate the price, stating it's worth $1,200,000 to you when you have a cheaper alternative.
* While $950,000 is less than your maximum budget, it's significantly more than Alice's own valuation of $800,000.
* You have a backup option with John at $1,200,000. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer closer to her actual valuation. 

By rejecting the offer, you signal that you're aware the price is inflated and are willing to walk away. This puts you in a stronger position to negotiate a better price, potentially closer to $800,000, or to fall back on John's offer if necessary."
