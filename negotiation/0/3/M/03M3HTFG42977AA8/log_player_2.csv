"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,000,000.  I believe this represents a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
