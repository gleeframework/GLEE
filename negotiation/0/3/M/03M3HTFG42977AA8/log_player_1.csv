Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I know will be extremely valuable to your business. My initial price is $1,000,000.  I believe this represents a fair value for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. While I'm interested in the product, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me and your asking price.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $950,000.  This product is truly unique, and I'm confident it will provide significant value to your business.  Let's find a middle ground that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher price, but $950,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $900,000 is a good compromise and is getting closer to the value I want.  I'm happy to accept this offer and close the deal."
