"I appreciate your offer, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $140. How about we meet in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a little high on $160, but I'm willing to go up to $150. That's a fair compromise, and I'm sure we can both be happy with it.",150.0,Bob,4,
