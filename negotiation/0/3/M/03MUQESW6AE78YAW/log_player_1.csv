{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a valuable product. Given its potential and worth, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial price of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. This is the maximum amount I am willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While $1,200,000 is a good offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob.  We are early in the negotiation, and I'm willing to push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  However, I believe the value of this product is closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,260,000.  This is a competitive price for such a valuable asset."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel that $1,260,000 is beyond my current budget. I am willing to increase my counteroffer to $1,230,000. This brings us closer together, while still respecting my financial limits. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,230,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,230,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly interested and engaging in the negotiation.  His counteroffers are moving in the right direction. I'll continue to negotiate to try and get closer to $1,250,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I recognize your willingness to compromise, and to meet you closer to the middle ground, I'm willing to accept $1,245,000 for the product. This feels like a fair deal considering its inherent value."",
""product_price"": 1245000
}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. In light of our ongoing dialogue, I am willing to consider $1,240,000 as a fair price for the product. This represents a significant reduction from my initial proposal and I believe it strikes a balance between our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,240,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,240,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

Bob is unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $1,240,000 secures a significant profit over both my minimum and John's offer. It's time to close the deal."
