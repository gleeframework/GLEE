"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this exceptional product at a price of $1,350,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price by continuing negotiations.  I'm going to try and push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,275,000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable price considering its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to push for a higher price, Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is getting closer to my minimum.  It's also very close to what I'd get selling to John.  There's a risk that further negotiation could drag on and I might not get a better price.  At this point, it's better to secure the deal with Bob and avoid the possibility of a long negotiation or a lower offer from another buyer."
