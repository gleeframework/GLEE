"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the potential in your product, $2000000 is higher than I'm willing to go right now.  I'm interested in making a deal, but I'd like to offer you $1300000. Let me know if that's something we can work with.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, $1300000 is significantly below the value I've placed on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm prepared to offer the product to you for $1650000. This is a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let me know if you're willing to consider this offer.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1650000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - I'm prepared to offer $1550000. If we can agree on that, I'm ready to finalize the purchase.",1550000.0,Bob,4,
