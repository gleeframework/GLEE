Explanation: 

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $100.  There's no point in further negotiation. Accepting his offer would mean selling at our minimum, and further counteroffers risk alienating him. John offers a sure $100, which is the same as Bob's stubborn offer. It's time to move on to a more promising buyer."
