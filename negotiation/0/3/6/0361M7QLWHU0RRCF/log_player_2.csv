"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

This counteroffer is a starting point for negotiation. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it leaves room for us to meet somewhere in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer to our acceptable price, but we can still try to negotiate a bit more. Let's see if she's willing to go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

We're inching closer to our goal.  This offer aims for a price that benefits both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $70 is closer, but I need to get at least $80 for the product. Let's meet halfway at $75.  I think that's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is holding firm at $80, and her offer of $75 is a good compromise. It's better to accept this deal than risk losing it and having to buy from John at $80."
