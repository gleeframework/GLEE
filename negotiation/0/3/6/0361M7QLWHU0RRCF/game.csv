"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $100 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $60 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a fair price for both of us. Let's meet in the middle.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $70 is closer, but I need to get at least $80 for the product. Let's meet halfway at $75.  I think that's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Alice,5,
