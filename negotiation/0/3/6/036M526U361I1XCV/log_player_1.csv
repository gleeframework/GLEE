"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):** By opening with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000), you establish a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a price well above your minimum.
* **Confidence and Value Emphasis:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in its worth, justifying the high initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:**  While starting high, you signal a willingness to negotiate, which can encourage Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is above his initial perceived value, it's still significantly below your minimum acceptable price. You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate, and selling to John guarantees your minimum, so there's room to counter."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 falls short of what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a more appropriate reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession, but Firm:** You're making a substantial concession from your initial price, showing movement and a desire to find an agreement. However, you're still aiming high to provide negotiation buffer.
* **Reiterating Value:** You're continuing to emphasize the product's value, subtly countering Bob's attempt to anchor the price lower.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps you well above your minimum while encouraging Bob to make a more significant move if he's genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I recognize its potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's find common ground at this point. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met your minimum acceptable price. While you could try to push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away, and you already have a guaranteed offer at this price from John. Accepting now secures the best possible outcome in this scenario."
