"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's worth rejecting and making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 falls short of what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a more appropriate reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,800,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I recognize its potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's find common ground at this point."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
