"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and I'm open to discussing this further.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for this product, which I believe is a fair price given its value to me. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering and understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,300,000 falls short of what I can accept. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a more appropriate reflection of its worth.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of this product. While I recognize its potential, $1,800,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000, which is a significant compromise for me.  Let's find common ground at this point.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
