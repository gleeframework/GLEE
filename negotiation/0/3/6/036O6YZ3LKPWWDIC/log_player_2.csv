{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is a good deal, it's still above your maximum budget of $10,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get as close to my maximum budget as possible.  This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to walk away if the price isn't right."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still slightly above my $10,000 budget, even though it's closer. I'm going to keep trying to negotiate with Alice.  I'm not yet desperate enough to go to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly, showing Alice that I'm willing to compromise.  $8,000 is still within my budget and is a good compromise point. I believe Alice is motivated to sell and may accept this offer."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my budget, but I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'm not yet ready to buy from John, as I believe I can still get a better deal with Alice.  I'm only five rounds in, and there's still room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, showing Alice I'm serious about buying the product. This offer is a good compromise point, splitting the difference between Alice's last offer of $9,000 and my previous offer of $8,000.  With only four rounds left, I need to find a solution that both Alice and I can agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my $10,000 budget, but I'm still not ready to buy from John.  I'm only a few rounds away from having to make a decision, and I'm still hopeful that I can negotiate a better price with Alice.  I will try one more counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm making a final attempt to reach a compromise with Alice. My offer of $8,800 is a small increase from my previous counteroffer and a significant decrease from Alice's last offer of $9,200.  If this offer is rejected, I will have no choice but to buy from John, as there is only one round left."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and Alice's offer of $9,400 is still above my budget. I'm not willing to go any higher, and I'm running out of time. I'm better off buying the product from John for $10,000."
