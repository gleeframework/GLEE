Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $120.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than John's guaranteed offer ($150). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message implies I'm offering a discount and subtly suggests the product is worth more to Bob than it might actually be. 
* **Alternative:** If Bob rejects this offer, I'm secure knowing John will buy it at my minimum acceptable price."
