Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, and it's a fair price for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's important to find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

While $7,750 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum threshold of $8,000.  It's better to sell to John and guarantee a profit than to continue negotiating with Bob and risk ending up with less."
