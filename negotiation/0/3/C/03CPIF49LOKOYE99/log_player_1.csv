Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Starting Point:** You know John will buy the product for $12,000, so that's your safety net.  Starting your negotiation close to this point maximizes potential profit. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you want as much as possible, starting at $12,000 leaves no room for Bob to counter-offer. Offering $11,000 might seem like leaving money on the table, but it gives the perception of a potential deal for Bob.
* **Psychology:**  The message aims to be persuasive without being aggressive. Highlighting the ""fair price"" and ""value"" aims to nudge Bob towards accepting.

**It's important to note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You have a strong position knowing your minimum acceptable price is $12,000."
