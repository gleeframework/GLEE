"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $8000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $12000 for it. Would you be open to that price?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, $12000 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9500? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9500 is still a bit of a stretch for me, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can do $11000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",11000.0,Alice,5,
