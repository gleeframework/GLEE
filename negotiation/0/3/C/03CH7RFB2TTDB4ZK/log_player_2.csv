**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's offer:**  Alice is selling the product for $1,000,000, while John is selling it for $1,200,000.
* **You are willing to pay up to $1,200,000:**  This means Alice's offer is within your budget. 

Therefore, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and save $200,000."
