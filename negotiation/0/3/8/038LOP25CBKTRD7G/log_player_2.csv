"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. I know it's worth that much to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm open to discussing the details further if you have any questions. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer won't save you any money. You're essentially buying it at its full value. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to consider other options, and potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice or buy from John if there's a better deal available."
