"I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the concession, but $18000 is still higher than my budget allows. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $16000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer and reflects the value of the product for me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $12000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which is $14000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests and brings us closer to a deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make a deal, I'm willing to offer $13000. This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects the value of this product to me.  I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement.",14500.0,Alice,7,
