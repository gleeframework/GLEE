"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you is $10000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is far above what I'm willing to pay.  While she mentions my value of $10,000, her starting point of $18,000 is a significant overreach. I will counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the concession, but $18,000 is still higher than my budget allows. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth while allowing me to stay within my budget.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $10500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to lower the price to $16000. This is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you and my target price. I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't go above my budget.  I'll counter with a price closer to my limit and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still outside my price range. I'm prepared to pay $12,000, which is a significant step up from my initial offer and reflects the value of the product for me. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. However, $12000 is still below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12000 and $16000, which is $14000. This is a fair price that balances both our interests and brings us closer to a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer, $14,000 is still outside of my comfort zone. I'm not willing to budge much further, and if I don't see a significant move from Alice, I'm prepared to buy from John.  I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, but I'm also keeping John's offer in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $14,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. To make a deal, I'm willing to offer $13,000. This is a significant compromise on my part and reflects the value of this product to me.  I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm still willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to meet you at $14500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down in price, $14,500 is still too high for me, considering John's offer of $10,000. I'm not willing to risk getting stuck in a longer negotiation with Alice, especially since I'm already nearing my budget limit. I'm going to accept John's offer and move on."
