Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not willing to go as low as $75, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $95. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is clearly not budging much on price. Her latest offer of $95 is still significantly higher than John's offer of $80. It's unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes it worth continuing the negotiation."
