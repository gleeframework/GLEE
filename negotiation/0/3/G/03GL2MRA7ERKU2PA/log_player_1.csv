{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to me. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you have a budget, $11,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is closer to what I want, but it's still below my minimum. I'll reject it and see if I can get a bit more in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $12,250 is a good number, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we settle on $12,400? This would be a great deal for you, and it would give me a little extra to work with. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12400}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about we try $12,300? I think that's the best we can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,300
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $12,300 is still below my minimum, I'm getting close to the end of the negotiations.  There's a good chance I won't be able to get a better offer, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely.  I'll accept Bob's offer, as it's still a decent profit for me."
