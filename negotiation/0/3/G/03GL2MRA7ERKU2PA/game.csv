"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think!",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $11,000 for the product. I'm really interested in it, but I have a budget to stick to.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand you have a budget, $11,000 is too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,500? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit closer to what I need.  Let's see if we can make this work!",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $12,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we try $12,250? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",12250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  $12,250 is a good number, but I'm still holding out for a little more. How about we settle on $12,400? This would be a great deal for you, and it would give me a little extra to work with. Let's make this happen!",12400.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm still not willing to go above $12,250. I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time, so how about we try $12,300? I think that's the best we can do.",12300.0,Bob,6,
