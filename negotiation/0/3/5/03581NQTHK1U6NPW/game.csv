"I'm interested in your product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I value your business, $900000 is still a bit lower than what I'm seeking. I'm willing to come down to $950000 to close this deal.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still interested in the product, but I think $950000 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $925000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I'm willing to make a deal at this price.",925000.0,Bob,4,
