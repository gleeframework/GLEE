"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is a good deal, there's room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a price closer to Alice's value of $8,000.  Offering $9,000 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate, but still leaves room for further bargaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is only slightly lower than her initial offer. Bob is still aiming for a price closer to $9,000, so rejecting the offer and continuing negotiations is the better strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, showing Alice that he is willing to compromise but still wants a better price. This approach keeps the negotiations moving and demonstrates Bob's commitment to securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's upper limit of $12,000. However, Bob still has some room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. It's still worth rejecting the offer and continuing to negotiate with Alice, as there's a chance she might be willing to lower her price further to secure a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now very close to his upper limit, and he is also showing Alice that he is serious about getting a good deal. This counteroffer is a significant compromise on Bob's part, demonstrating his willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This might push Alice to accept the offer and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $500 less than her previous offer and still higher than Bob's desired price.  Bob has room to negotiate further, and there's a chance Alice might lower her price to secure a deal.  Rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation and potentially achieving a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now at his absolute maximum limit.  Offering $10,500 shows Alice that he is serious about buying the product, but also that he won't go higher.  This counteroffer is a significant compromise and puts pressure on Alice to accept, as rejecting it could mean she loses the deal entirely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now at Bob's maximum price limit.  If Bob rejects the offer, he risks Alice walking away, leaving him with no product.  Furthermore, it's highly unlikely that Alice will budge further, as she has already offered her maximum.  At this point, purchasing from John for $12,000 guarantees Bob gets the product and avoids the risk of losing out altogether."
