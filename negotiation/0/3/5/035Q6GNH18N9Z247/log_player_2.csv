"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $800,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is closer to my budget, it's still above my maximum of $800,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate further to see if I can get a lower price before considering buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to make a final concession. I'll accept $925,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows me to meet my minimum. If you're serious about this deal, let's finalize it at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $925,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $800,000.  While it's a good deal, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  I'm going to go with John's offer and purchase the product for $800,000 to ensure I stay within my budget."
