"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both her valuation and John's offer. There is plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However,  $10,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair price."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's opening offer. This leaves room for negotiation and signals that I'm looking for a good deal.
* **Polite and Reasonable:**  The tone remains friendly and suggests the $7,000 offer is fair. 
* **Strategic Aim:** My ideal outcome is to get the price closer to Alice's valuation ($8,000) without going over my limit ($12,000)."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000, which is still a great deal for you given the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving towards a more reasonable price, but it's still above her valuation.  We'll continue negotiating to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm suggesting a price directly between our previous offers, signaling a willingness to compromise. 
* **Targeting Her Valuation:** This offer is exactly at Alice's valuation of the product. While she'd likely prefer more, it's a strong position to negotiate from.
* **Time Constraint:**  As we're getting closer to my alternative option (buying from John), putting a fair offer on the table helps push towards a decision."
