Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This gives me a good margin above my minimum acceptable price of $80, but also leaves room for negotiation. I believe this is a good starting point to gauge Bob's interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $80, and it's likely that he will be unwilling to go any higher. Accepting his offer allows me to quickly finalize the sale and secure a profit."
