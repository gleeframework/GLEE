"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested but $13,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal quickly.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit short on the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $13,250. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll still get a great deal.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,250 is still a bit steep.  I'm willing to go up to $12,750, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal. ",12750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm willing to meet you at $13,000, which is my minimum price. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I see you're firm on your price, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm going to need a little more flexibility from you. My final offer is $12,800. If we can't agree on this price, I'm going to have to look at other options.",12800.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,900. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12900.0,Alice,7,
