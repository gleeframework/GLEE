"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $180. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love it.",180.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $180 is way above what I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to purchase the product for $80.  Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and sell the product to you for $120. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $120 is still out of my budget.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $100.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $110, which is closer to my original price. It's still a good deal for you, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $90.  This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to go with John's offer.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $90 is your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for that low. I'm willing to meet you at $105, which is still a good compromise. It's my last offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",105.0,Alice,7,
