This product is not just an item; it's a solution tailored to enhance your daily experiences. Considering its exceptional features and benefits, we believe it's worth more than its face value. To make this opportunity accessible to you, I'm offering it at a special introductory price of $150. This is an exclusive offer, so don't hesitate to seize it while it lasts. If you have any questions or need further information, please let me know. I look forward to hearing your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is exactly your maximum price point. Since you have no information on the actual value of the product to Alice, accepting her offer is the most logical choice. There is no benefit to rejecting it, as you would then have to buy the same product from John for the same price."
