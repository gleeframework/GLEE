Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure I'm willing to go as high as $13,500. I'm thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget.

Bob is unlikely to go much higher than $12,000.  It's better to take John's guaranteed offer than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
