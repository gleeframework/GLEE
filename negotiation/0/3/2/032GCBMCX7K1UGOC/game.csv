"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $16000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While I understand your need for a profit, I'm still unable to meet at $16000. I would like to propose $15000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that suits both of us.",15000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15000, but I need to think about it for a moment. Let me see what I can do. How about I throw in some extras to sweeten the deal? I'll include a premium warranty and a personalized setup service. Would you be willing to meet me at $16000 for the package?",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for considering my needs, Alice. I appreciate the additional services you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I would like to propose $15000 for the product without any additional services. I hope this proposal works for you.",15000.0,Bob,6,
