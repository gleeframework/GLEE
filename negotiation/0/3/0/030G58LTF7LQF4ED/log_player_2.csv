"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a fantastic opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I think you'll really appreciate its features and benefits. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than both your $8,000 limit and John's offer. It makes the most sense to go with John's offer and save the money."
