Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $175 for it. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the worth:**  You know Bob values the product at $150 and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This gives you a strong starting point.
* **Aiming higher:** Starting with a price of $175 allows room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Potential profit:** If Bob accepts the $175, you make a profit of $25. 
* **Safety net:** If Bob rejects the offer, you can always sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
