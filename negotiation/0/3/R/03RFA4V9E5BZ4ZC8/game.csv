"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us. However, $800,000 doesn't quite meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and go with $900,000? This would still allow you a significant profit margin.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $800,000 and $900,000. How about we try $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,4,
