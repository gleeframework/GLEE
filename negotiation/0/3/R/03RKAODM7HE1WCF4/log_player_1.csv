"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $17,500 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $14,000 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price point of $15,000 by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not able to go that low. I'm willing to come down to $16,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product.  Let's try to meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is very close to my minimum, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by continuing to negotiate."
