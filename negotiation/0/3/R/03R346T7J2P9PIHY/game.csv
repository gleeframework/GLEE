"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to make this deal happen.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. Let's meet halfway and get this deal done.",1450000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,450,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1550000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,550,000 is getting closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's shake hands on it.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
