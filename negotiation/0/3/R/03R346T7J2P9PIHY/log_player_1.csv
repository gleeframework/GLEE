"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob, or at least secure the $1,500,000 from John."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. Let's meet halfway and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can push for a higher price. It's a risk, but I'm confident I can get closer to my target of $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,450,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,550,000 is getting closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's shake hands on it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000.
