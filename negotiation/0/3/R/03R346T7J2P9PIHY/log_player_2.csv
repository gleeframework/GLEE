"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I believe this price reflects its true value.  Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's in Bob's best interest to try and negotiate a lower price.  There are still 9 rounds left, so Bob has time to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,750,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $1,600,000? This is still a great price for you, and it allows me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's work together to make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  Bob can likely get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He also has the option of buying from John for $1,500,000, so he's not in a rush to accept a deal that's not favorable to him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. I'm willing to go up to $1,450,000. Let's meet halfway and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts, but $1,450,000 is still not enough for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,550,000, which is a significant reduction from my previous offer. This price reflects the value of the product and allows me to achieve a fair outcome.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's target price, but it's still slightly above what he's willing to pay.  Since Bob has the option to buy from John for $1,500,000, he can afford to continue negotiating for a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue the negotiation and try to push for a lower price."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $1,550,000 is getting closer, but I'm still only able to go up to $1,500,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly.  Let's shake hands on it."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
