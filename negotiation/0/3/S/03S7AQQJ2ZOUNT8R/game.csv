"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $125 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $140? That's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more leeway.  What do you say?",140.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still open to negotiating but $130 is just a bit too low for me at this point. I'm willing to meet you halfway. Would you consider $135? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal.",135.0,Alice,5,
