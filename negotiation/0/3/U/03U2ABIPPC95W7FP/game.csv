"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now offering the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we settle on $95? It's a fair price for both of us and will allow us to close the deal.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $95. I'm now offering the product to you for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll see the value it brings. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,5,
