Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still above Bob's desired price point. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting and making a counteroffer is the best course of action."

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,300,000 is unfortunately below what I can accept. I'm happy to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,375,000. This price reflects the value of the product and provides us both with a fair deal.  Let me know your thoughts.
