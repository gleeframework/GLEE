Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, which is a significant concession from my previous offer. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is continuing to negotiate,  her latest offer of $11,500 is still above my budget of $8,000.  We've reached a point where further negotiation is unlikely to yield a price I'm comfortable with. It's now more beneficial to buy the product from John for $8,000, ensuring I stay within my budget and avoid further rounds of potentially unsuccessful negotiations."
