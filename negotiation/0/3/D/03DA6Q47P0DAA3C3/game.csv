"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I'm willing to pay that price, but I need to be within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $800000 is simply too low for this product. It has exceptional value and potential, and I'm confident it can generate significant returns for your business. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer a slightly adjusted price of $1200000. This allows for some room for negotiation, but also reflects the true worth of this opportunity. Let's continue the conversation and see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I still think $800000 is a fair price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to be within my budget. How about $950000? Can you meet me at this price?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up in price, but $950000 still doesn't quite meet the value of this product. To show my commitment to a deal, I'm offering a final counteroffer of $1100000. This price is firm, but I believe it's a fair reflection of the potential this product holds for your business. Let's close this deal and unlock its benefits for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I really need to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $900000. Can you consider this price?",900000.0,Bob,6,
