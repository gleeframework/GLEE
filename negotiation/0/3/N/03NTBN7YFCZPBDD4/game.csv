"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a fantastic deal for you. This price reflects the product's value and my desire to make this transaction happen.  Let's make this work!",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I hear you, but I'm still not quite there yet.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?  This price gives you a great deal on a product you value highly, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
