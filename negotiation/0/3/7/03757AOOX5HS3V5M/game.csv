"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900,000. I think this is a fair starting point considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is valuable, I find the starting price a bit high. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth to me. Let me know what you think.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000.

Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a more agreeable price.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $750,000?  I feel this reflects a fair compromise and would allow us to close the deal.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $825,000.

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To meet you halfway, I could go up to $775,000.  This is a significant investment for me, but I believe the product's value justifies it.  What do you say?",775000.0,Bob,6,
