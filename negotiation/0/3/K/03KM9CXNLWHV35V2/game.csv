"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $900,000 is closer, it's still a bit beyond what I had in mind. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $750,000 is still a bit above your target price. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
