"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get a good price for the product, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $11,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,500. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet halfway.  While I value your offer,  $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we compromise at $10,750?  This would be a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,750 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,200 is still quite a bit below my desired price. However, I want to see if we can find common ground. I'm willing to go down to $10,400. This price reflects the value of the product and allows us to close the deal fairly. Would you be willing to consider this final offer?",10400.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,200 and $10,400, which would be $10,300. Can you consider this offer?",10300.0,Bob,8,
