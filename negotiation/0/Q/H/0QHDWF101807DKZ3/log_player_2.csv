# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable for your business. My initial offer is $1,200,000.  I'm open to discussing a fair price, but I believe this is a strong starting point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is significantly higher than my maximum budget. It's best to start negotiating and see if we can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of this product, $1,200,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing you to make a profit while staying within my budget."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  I understand budgeting is important, but let's find a middle ground.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still allows me to make a reasonable profit while being more in line with your budget.  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000. I'll continue negotiating to try and get a better price. It's worth seeing if we can reach a deal before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This would be a fair compromise that allows both of us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. It's getting closer, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair return on this valuable product.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're serious about acquiring this product, I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $1,000,000 is exactly my maximum budget, and it's also the same price as John is selling it for. There's no benefit to continuing the negotiation.  I'll accept this offer and move forward with the purchase."
