"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Since you are willing to pay a maximum of $1,200,000 for the product, and Alice is offering it at that price, it's a neutral offer. You're not saving any money, but you're not losing any either.  However, you have the option to buy from John for the same price, so you might as well reject Alice's offer and explore other options."
