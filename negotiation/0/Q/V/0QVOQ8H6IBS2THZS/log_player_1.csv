Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's unlikely Bob will accept it immediately. This allows me to gauge his interest and potential budget while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident in the value of my product, so I'm not afraid to ask for a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,600,000 is a good price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and is willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm lowering my price a bit to show flexibility and encourage Bob to continue negotiating.  $1,800,000 is still significantly higher than John's offer, so I'm confident I can get a better deal than selling to him.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will push Bob closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,650,000 is a good compromise. It's higher than John's offer and close enough to my desired price that it's worth accepting. Further negotiation might lead to a higher price, but there's a risk of Bob withdrawing his offer altogether. Accepting this offer ensures a good profit and avoids unnecessary risk."
