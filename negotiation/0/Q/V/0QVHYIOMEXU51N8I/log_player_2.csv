Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.

It's time to cut bait and go with John. Alice is unlikely to go below $85, and your goal is to get the product for the best price. John offers a sure thing at $80, making it the most financially sensible choice now."
