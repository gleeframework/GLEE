"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $120 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  This is a great deal for a product that's worth much more. Let's find a middle ground.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $75 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $85, but that's my final offer. It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
