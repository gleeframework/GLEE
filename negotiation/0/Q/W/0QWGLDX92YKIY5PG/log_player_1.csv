{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate. 
* **It's below your minimum value:** This offer is still above your minimum of $1,200,000, meaning you're not losing money if Bob accepts.
* **It's a good opening position:** This initial offer is strong but leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.

Remember, this is just the first offer.  Be prepared to negotiate based on Bob's response.  And keep John in mind â€“ you can always walk away and sell to him for your minimum price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between our respective valuations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

Bob's offer is below my minimum value, but it's closer to my goal.  I'll reject it for now and counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a compromise."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your final offer, Alice. I understand your position and I've carefully considered your proposal. I am unable to meet your price at $1,065,000. However, I would like to propose one last time at $1,062,500 for your product. This is my best offer, and I hope it will be acceptable to you.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. It's clear that we won't be able to reach a deal that satisfies both of us. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,200,000."
