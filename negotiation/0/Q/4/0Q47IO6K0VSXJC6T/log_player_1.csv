Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product presents a unique opportunity and I'm pleased to offer it to you. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,300,000."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  While Bob values the product at $800,000, starting significantly lower might raise suspicion or undervalue the product. A high starting point leaves room for negotiation.
* **Strategic positioning:** Offering the product at $1,300,000 positions it as a premium option while still leaving a potential profit margin for Bob if he finds a way to leverage it beyond his initial valuation. 
* **Alternative in mind:**  Knowing John will buy the product for $1,500,000 provides a safety net.  Alice can afford to negotiate with Bob, but ultimately won't go below her guaranteed sale price."
