Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it for $12,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000, aiming higher with Bob could lead to a better outcome.
* **Strategic Starting Point:** $12,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Value-Based Language:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob, not just the price, increasing the chance of acceptance.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes I don't know Bob's financial limitations. If I had more information about his budget, I might adjust my approach."
