"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'll be interested in. I'm asking for $10,000 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $10,000 is less than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum price point. It's better to reject the offer and see if Bob can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower offer that's still above John's price, leaving room for negotiation. This also signals Bob's seriousness about buying the product, while also making it clear that he's not going to pay Alice's full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $9,250 is still above Bob's maximum.  It's better to reject the offer and see if Bob can push for a lower price.  Additionally, Bob still has the option of buying from John for $8,000, so he's not in a rush to settle for an unfavorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but he's getting closer to Alice's last offer.  By offering $9,000, Bob is signaling his willingness to compromise while still trying to save as much money as possible."
