Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is still too low. I'll try to get a better price from him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial goal, Bob's offer of $9,000 is a reasonable compromise.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing both Bob and the opportunity to sell to John."
