"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  I'd be happy to purchase it for $8,500.  Let me know what you think!",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you're interested in the product. $8,500 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? Let's work together to find a price that's fair for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $9,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, which I believe is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close the deal at this price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
