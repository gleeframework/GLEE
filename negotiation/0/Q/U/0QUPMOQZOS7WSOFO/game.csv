"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a price closer to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than you're willing to pay, but I'm still interested in closing the deal. I can meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice.  While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still a bit outside my budget. How about we settle at $925,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",925000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $950,000, which is a bit closer to your target. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",950000.0,Alice,5,
