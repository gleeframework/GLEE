"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum acceptable price of $10,000, but still leaves room for negotiation. Bob likely sees value in the product and might be willing to pay more than $10,000.  However, it's also low enough to leave space for potential counteroffers, ensuring a good chance of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,500 is a decent offer, it's still lower than my desired price point. I believe I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation and sending a counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John for $10,000 just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12750}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm not yet ready to sell at that price.  I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer. It's too early to sell to John for $10,000."

```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price. There are still rounds left, and I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer.  It's too early to sell to John for $10,000."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting close to my minimum, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price.  We are in the final rounds, and I believe I can still push for a slightly higher price by making another counteroffer.  I'm not ready to sell to John for $10,000 just yet."

{""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise but still aiming for a price closer to my desired profit.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250.

(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is the final round, and Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price. However, I'm not willing to risk a counteroffer that could potentially result in a lower price.  John's offer of $10,000 is a guaranteed sale and ensures I don't lose money.  Therefore, I'll accept John's offer."
