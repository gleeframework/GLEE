Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000.  I know this product would be a valuable asset to you."", ""product_price"": 1190000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $1,200,000 as possible while still making the offer attractive to Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so offering it slightly below your guaranteed price with John creates a significant profit margin for Bob. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing you have a guaranteed buyer, the offer implies a degree of scarcity or time sensitivity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
