"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a fair profit, considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll make a new offer of $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  Let's make this happen.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you at $850,000, but only if you're willing to throw in an additional $5,000 as a one-time payment. This would bring the total to $855,000. Let's see if we can shake on it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
