"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you, Bob. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I need to make a fair profit, considering the product's worth to me is $1,000,000. I'm willing to start with an initial offer of $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's always good to start with rejecting the first offer.  It gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $850,000 is a bit below your budget, Bob. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll make a new offer of $875,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'll reject Alice's offer.  $875,000 is still above my budget.  I'll try to negotiate further and see if I can get closer to my target price of $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $825,000.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. However, $825,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth my while. I'll meet you at $850,000, but only if you're willing to throw in an additional $5,000 as a one-time payment. This would bring the total to $855,000. Let's see if we can shake on it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is adding a one-time payment on top of her price, which is not ideal.  I'm starting to think this negotiation is not going to get me to my target price.  I'll go ahead and buy the product from John for $800,000."
