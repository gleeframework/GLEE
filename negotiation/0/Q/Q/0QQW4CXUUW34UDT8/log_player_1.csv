Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product has value, $1,200,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $600,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $600,000 is a bit low for me.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand you're trying to reach a compromise, Bob, but $700,000 is still a significant discount from my initial offer.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

I'll meet you at $900,000, which is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go.
