"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $600,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my financial constraints.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm confident that this product can generate substantial value for you, and I want to find a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal considering the product's value.",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair offer and hope we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I'm motivated to close this deal.  Let's make this simple - $825,000, and I'll include [mention a small, value-added bonus related to the product - e.g., expedited delivery, additional support, etc.].  This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and the added bonus is definitely enticing. However, $825,000 is still just outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This offer represents a fair value for both of us, and I hope we can close this deal.",800000.0,Bob,8,
