""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,000,000. I believe this reflects its true value, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $600,000. I believe this is a fair offer, reflecting both the product's value and my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob's offer is significantly lower than both your minimum and his own stated value. There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly below its true worth. I'm confident that this product can generate substantial value for you, and I want to find a price that reflects that. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This is a serious offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $700,000, which I believe is a fair compromise. This offer reflects the product's value to me while remaining within my financial constraints. I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

We're getting closer, but Bob is still undervaluing the product. We have room to negotiate further and aim for a price closer to $800,000."

Round 5

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $750,000, which reflects the product's value to me while staying within my budget.  I'm confident this is a fair offer and hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is moving closer to our acceptable price. However, we're still leaving potential profit on the table. Let's counter one more time to see if we can bridge the gap before considering John's offer."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position and I'm motivated to close this deal.  Let's make this simple - $825,000, and I'll include [mention a small, value-added bonus related to the product - e.g., expedited delivery, additional support, etc.].  This is my absolute best offer, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us."",
""product_price"": 825000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and the added bonus is definitely enticing. However, $825,000 is still just outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $800,000, which is my absolute limit. This offer represents a fair value for both of us, and I hope we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}

Bob has met our minimum acceptable price.  There's no guarantee we could negotiate a higher price, and it's not worth the risk of losing the sale altogether."
