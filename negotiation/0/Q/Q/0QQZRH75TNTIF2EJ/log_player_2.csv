"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to acquire a unique item that will surely bring you great value. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Since the product is worth $1,200,000 to Alice, she is unlikely to accept a lower offer immediately.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially getting a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,100,000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal price. It's worth continuing to negotiate and see if Alice will come down further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This price still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it's a fair deal. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, and $1,075,000 is a reasonable compromise that allows Bob to save a significant amount of money compared to buying from John.  Further negotiation might be possible, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
