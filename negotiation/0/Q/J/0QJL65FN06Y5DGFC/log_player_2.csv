"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  I'm willing to take a few rounds to see if I can get a better price.  Since my limit is $1,200,000, I have some wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking to spend a bit less, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $875,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is closer to my target price, but I'm still hoping for a lower price.  I'm willing to negotiate a bit more and see if I can get her to come down further. I have plenty of rounds left to try and reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being willing to meet me halfway.  I'm still a bit hesitant at $875,000. How about we split the difference and settle at $862,500? This would allow both of us to walk away feeling satisfied with the deal."", ""product_price"": 862500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to meet you at $870,000, which is a bit closer to your offer. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $870,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $870,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $870,000, which is just $10,000 above my previous counteroffer.  At this point, continuing to negotiate might not be worth it, considering I have a limited number of rounds.  It's a fair price, and I can still save a significant amount compared to buying from John."
