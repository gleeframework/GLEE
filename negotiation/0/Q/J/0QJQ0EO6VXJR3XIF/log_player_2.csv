"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above her minimum value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.  As Bob, my goal is to save as much money as possible. It's better to counter-offer and see if we can reach a price closer to her minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's still well above your minimum value and closer to what I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a great opportunity for you to acquire the product, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,150,000, which is closer to my counteroffer of $1,100,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm getting close to my maximum.  Accepting the offer will save me $350,000 compared to buying from John, making it the best option at this point."
