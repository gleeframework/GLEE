Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's still well above your minimum value and closer to what I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
