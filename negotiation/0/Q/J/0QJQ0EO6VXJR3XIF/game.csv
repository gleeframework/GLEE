"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will greatly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering it's still well above your minimum value and closer to what I'm willing to pay. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is still a great opportunity for you to acquire the product, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
