"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique and valuable item. I believe you'll love it, and I'm confident you'll be willing to pay a premium for it. I'm offering it to you for $20000. Let me know if this is something you're interested in!",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the item, but I'm looking for a more reasonable price. Could we discuss a price closer to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. I can offer it to you for $18000. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value this item brings. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $18000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still hoping for a price closer to $10000. Can we work towards a mutual agreement that respects both our positions?",15000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're still looking for a price closer to $10000, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you at $16000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product. If you're still not interested, I'm happy to discuss other options with you, but I won't go any lower than this. What do you say?",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I see your position, Alice. While $16000 is closer to what I was hoping for, I'm still not convinced it's a fair price given the current market conditions and similar products available. I would like to propose $14000 as a potential compromise. I hope this proposal allows us to reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial.",14000.0,Bob,6,
