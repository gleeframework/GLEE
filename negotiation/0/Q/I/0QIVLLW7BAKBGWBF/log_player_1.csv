{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $8,000, so this offer gives him some room to negotiate without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **It's below your minimum:** You're willing to sell for at least $12,000, so this offer leaves you space to negotiate downwards if necessary. 

By starting with a higher price and offering a friendly message, you're setting the stage for a positive negotiation. You can adjust the price and message based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum of $12,000, it's still below what you're aiming for. Since you have a guaranteed sale to John for $12,000, it's worthwhile to try and push for a better price with Bob.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and see if you can secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,500?  I'm confident this is still a great value for you, and it's closer to what I need to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your response. I've given it some thought and am willing to go up to $9,200 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,200 is still less than your ideal price of $12,000, it's now closer to your minimum. Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and is clearly interested in the product. Accepting his offer ensures a sale without the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a stalemate.  The potential loss of $2,800 is outweighed by the certainty of a sale and the time saved."
