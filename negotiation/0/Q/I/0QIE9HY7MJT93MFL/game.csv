"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to get something truly special. Considering its value and quality, I believe it's worth more than $100. What do you think? Would you be interested in purchasing it for $110?",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay at this time.  I'd be interested in purchasing it for $85.  Let me know what you think.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to find a middle ground. How about we aim for $95? This still reflects the value of the product while making it more accessible to you. What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but $95 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to stay within my limit of $85. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see your point, Bob. How about we try $92? It's slightly above your previous offer but still below my initial asking price. I believe this could be a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",92.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $92 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",90.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob. Let's try $91. This is a step closer to your offer, reflecting the value of the product while staying within your budget. I hope this helps us reach a mutually agreeable solution.",91.0,Alice,7,
