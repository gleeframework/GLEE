Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about $10,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  $10,000 is still too low for me, considering the value of the product. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't drop below a certain price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to my target, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm going to counteroffer again and see if we can get closer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiation.  While I'm willing to compromise, $10,500 is still below my minimum.  How about $10,750?  This offer is a good compromise and hopefully we can close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm getting closer to my target, but $10,750 is still a bit high. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $10,625.  This will hopefully allow us to finally close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,625
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, $10,625 is a good compromise.  I don't want to risk losing the deal completely and ending up with only $8,000 from John."
