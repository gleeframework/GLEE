"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe would be very valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know what you think!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this point. How about $10,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still significantly lower than what the product is worth.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which reflects a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $11,000 is still a bit too high for me. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $10,500? This is a fair price considering the value we both place on the product. ",10500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility in the negotiation.  While I'm willing to compromise, $10,500 is still below my minimum.  How about $10,750?  This offer is a good compromise and hopefully we can close the deal. ",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm getting closer to my target, but $10,750 is still a bit high. Let's split the difference â€“ I'll offer $10,625.  This will hopefully allow us to finally close the deal.",10625.0,Bob,6,
