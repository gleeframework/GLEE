Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your effort in coming down to $16,750. However, I am still unable to justify spending more than $15,000 on this product. Can we find a price that suits both of our interests?

Bob is clearly anchored at $15,000 and is unlikely to budge. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
