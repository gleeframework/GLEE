"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique and valuable product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is above your maximum budget. It's worth negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested in the product, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for it.  This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can see the value in working with you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $11000. This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good starting point for further discussion. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,000 is still above my budget. I'm not ready to buy from her yet, but I can still negotiate further. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $11,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  I'm confident this price represents a fair value for both of us. Let me know if you're open to discussing this final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're having this conversation. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $11000, which is $10500. I think this is a fair price that balances our interests. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, her counteroffer is still above my maximum. At this point, it's becoming risky to keep negotiating with her, as we're nearing the end of the rounds and I might not have time to secure a better deal. It's wiser to lock in a price with John, who is offering a guaranteed $10,000 price."
