"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this unique item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, $900,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer you $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering both of our positions.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there.  $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $875,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your desire to compromise, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $875,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $925,000. I believe this is the best compromise we can reach considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
