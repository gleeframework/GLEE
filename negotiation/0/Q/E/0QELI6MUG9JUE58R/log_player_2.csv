Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm getting close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to offer it to you for $825,000. This is as low as I can go, considering the product's true value to me is $800,000. What do you think?

**Reasoning:**

While I could try to negotiate further, Alice has signaled this is close to her minimum. Accepting at $825,000 ensures I get the product at a price significantly lower than John's offer ($1,000,000) and avoids the risk of the negotiation failing."
