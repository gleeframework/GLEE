"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal, as you know it's worth $120 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $115 is a good deal compared to John's $120 offer, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore if he can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the value to me. I'm willing to pay $110, but that's my top price.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower price than Alice's offer, but it's still a fair price given his valuation. This shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is a good compromise. It's closer to Bob's desired price of $110, and it's still a better deal than buying from John for $120.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a reasonable price without risking further negotiation."
