"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $12000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $13500? It's a fair price that still reflects the value of this product.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $12500. But honestly, it's still a bit low for me considering the value and uniqueness of this product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, how about $13000?  This price reflects the value we both see in this product and lets us close the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest.  $12750 is getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I'm willing to drop my price a little more, to $12900, as a final offer. This is a great deal for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you say?",12900.0,Alice,7,
