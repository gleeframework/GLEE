Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, just as it has been to me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,500,000. I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have room to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's worth and potential, you provide a reason for the high price, framing it as a valuable investment for Bob. 
* **""Fair"" price:**  While ambitious, framing the price as ""fair"" can make Bob feel like he's getting a reasonable deal, even if it's above his perceived value.

**Important Note:** This is a starting point.  Be prepared to potentially negotiate down if Bob rejects the initial offer.  You can always gauge his interest and adjust your price accordingly in further interactions."
