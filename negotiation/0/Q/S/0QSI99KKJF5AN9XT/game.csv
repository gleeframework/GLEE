"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2000000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $1600000 at this time.  Let me know if this is a price we can work with.",1600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. While $1600000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. How about $1800000?  This price reflects the value of the product while remaining within a reasonable range for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $1800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $1700000.  If we can meet in the middle, I think we can finalize this deal.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
