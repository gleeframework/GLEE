"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at $119. I believe it's a great deal, especially considering it's worth $120 to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $119. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $119
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to you, and Alice is offering it for $119. While that's a good deal, you can still get it for $120 from John if you reject Alice's offer. You're trying to save as much money as possible, so it's better to reject Alice's offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price with John."
