{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $14,500. I think it's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

This offer is close to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm hoping to get as close to $15,000 as possible without risking losing him to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'll counter his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low yet.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $13,500? That's still a great price for you considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your current one. How about we do $13,000 again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, and it's unlikely that further negotiation will yield a higher price.  It's better to accept his offer than risk losing him entirely or settling for the lower price from John."
