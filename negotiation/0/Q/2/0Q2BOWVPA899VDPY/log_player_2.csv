"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for an exclusive price of $165. This limited-time offer won't last long, so I encourage you to consider it carefully. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $165. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $165
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

Alice's offer is above your budget. You should try negotiating a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $165 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $130?"",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a good starting point. It's a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for negotiation if she's completely unwilling to go that low."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. For the time being, I am willing to sell the product for $140. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is closer to your budget, there's still room for negotiation before resorting to John's offer."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",

This counteroffer aims to split the difference between your previous offer and Alice's counteroffer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still striving for a good deal."
