"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. I believe it's worth $12,000 to you, and to make this a win-win, I'm willing to start the negotiation at $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $11,000 is above your maximum budget of $10,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  There's no immediate need to buy from John, as you have 10 rounds to reach a deal with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's within my budget and allows for potential compromise.  I'm also stating the value to me to emphasize my position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand you see the value in this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $10,500? This price reflects the true value of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, her offer of $10,500 is still slightly above my budget. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price.  I still have a few rounds left to work with Alice before having to consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $10,000? This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is my final offer, as it's at my maximum budget.  I've  stated it as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Alice to accept.  At this price, I would be getting the product for its value to me, and Alice would be getting a fair price, leaving room for her profit."
