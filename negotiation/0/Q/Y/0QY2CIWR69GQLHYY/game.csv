"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $115 is just a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is still a great price for a product worth $120 to you.  Let's make this happen!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $120. This is a fair price for both of us, as it's the value I place on the product and it's the price John is offering.",120.0,Bob,4,
