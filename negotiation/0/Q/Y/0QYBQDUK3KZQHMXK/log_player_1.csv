Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit.  Since I don't know Bob's valuation, I'm hoping to get him to bite.  However, I'm prepared to negotiate down if needed, but I won't go below my minimum of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is my minimum, I'm not desperate to sell right away. I'm going to try to negotiate higher.  I have 8 rounds left and I can always sell to John for the same price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a profit. I'm hoping this price is enticing enough for Bob to accept, but I'm also keeping room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is a good compromise. It's a bit lower than my initial target, but it's still a decent profit for me.  I'm comfortable with this deal and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  I've got more rounds left, but there's no guarantee that Bob will come back with a better offer, and I'm happy with the price."
