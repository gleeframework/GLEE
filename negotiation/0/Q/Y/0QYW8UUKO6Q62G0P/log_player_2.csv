"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its potential.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's significantly higher than his maximum budget, and there's no reason to accept it at this point.  There's a chance to negotiate a better price with Alice or buy from John for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product is interesting, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial price, and I believe it reflects the value we've both agreed this product holds.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above his target price.  He can continue negotiating with Alice or buy from John for a guaranteed lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a serious offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $950,000 is still significantly lower than what I need to accept. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and if you're interested, I'm ready to finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll be moving on to other potential buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Bob should choose to buy from John. Alice's final offer is still above his target price of $800,000, and he's already been through several rounds of negotiation. It's likely that further negotiation with Alice will be fruitless, and he has a guaranteed deal with John for a lower price."
