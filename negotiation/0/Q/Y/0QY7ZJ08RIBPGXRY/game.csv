"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $160 might be a bit too high for you. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $145.",145.0,Alice,3,

,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting closer to my budget, but $138 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $135.  I think this is a fair price considering we've both made some compromises.",135.0,Bob,6,
