{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  My starting price is $1,200,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1200000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  To start, I'm offering $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $800,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price with some negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this time.  I understand the value of this product to you, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
