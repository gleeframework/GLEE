"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this valuable product.  It's worth a great deal to me, and I believe it would be equally valuable to you.  My starting price is $1200000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget.  Rejecting allows you to start the negotiation process and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for your offer, but $1,200,000 is quite a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  To start, I'm offering $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by significantly reducing Alice's offer.  $800,000 is a strong starting point while still leaving room for negotiation.  The message emphasizes fairness and sets a clear price point."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's a bit too low for me at this time.  I understand the value of this product to you, and I'm willing to compromise.  How about we meet in the middle at $1000000?  That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
