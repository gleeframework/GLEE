"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000.  I believe this reflects its worth and allows for a beneficial deal for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle on something around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. I can be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its value. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise. However, $750,000 remains below the product's value.  To be fair to both of us, I propose a final offer of $825,000. This is my best price, and I believe it's a fair deal considering the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,
