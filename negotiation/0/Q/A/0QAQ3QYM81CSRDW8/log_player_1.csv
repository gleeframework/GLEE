Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it offers significant value, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves space for potential counter-offers from Bob while still staying above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Strategic Wording:** The message implies value and scarcity (""before I list it publicly"") to encourage Bob to consider the offer seriously."
