"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $9,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $11,000 is my absolute bottom line. This product is truly valuable, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll offer $10,500. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,
