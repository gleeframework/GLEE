"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that can help your business grow significantly. While it's worth a lot to me, I'm willing to offer it to you for a price that I know is a great deal.  How about $1,300,000? Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

You are willing to pay up to $1,000,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is higher than your maximum. Therefore, it makes sense to reject her offer and buy from John for $1,000,000."
