Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $1,100,000?

Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, and I'm definitely feeling good about the progress we've made. To wrap this up, how about we agree on $1,198,437?  It's a fair offer and I'm ready to close the deal if you are.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly committed and has steadily increased his offer. While we could try to squeeze out a bit more, the difference is becoming smaller, and there's always the risk he walks away. Accepting this offer secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
