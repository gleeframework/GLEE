"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this incredible product to you. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. I believe you'll find it's a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $900,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can try to negotiate a better price with Alice. John's offer acts as a fallback option, ensuring you can still get the product if negotiations with Alice fail."
