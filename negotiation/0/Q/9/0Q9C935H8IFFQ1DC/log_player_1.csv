I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate down if Bob counters, while still significantly exceeding my minimum value.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and get an idea of what he's willing to pay."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low.  It's significantly less than my minimum value.  I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up with a more reasonable counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering $1,750,000 as a counteroffer. This is still well above my minimum value of $1,500,000 but represents a significant concession from my initial offer.  I'm hoping this demonstrates my willingness to negotiate but also makes it clear I'm not going to sell for a ridiculously low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low.  While I'd prefer to make a profit, I'm not willing to go that low. John is offering a safe and secure price that meets my minimum. I'll sell to John."
