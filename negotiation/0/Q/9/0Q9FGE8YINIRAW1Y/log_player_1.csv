"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price point, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also using a friendly tone to encourage a positive interaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $130. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $130 is better than selling to John, it's still below my minimum. I'm confident I can get a better price if I counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $130 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference at $135? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $135. How about we try $132? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $132 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting.  I believe we can reach a better price with more negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $132 is still a bit too low for me. How about we try $134? It's a small step from my previous offer and would be a great deal for you. "", ""product_price"": 134}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway on the last offer, but I'd rather pay $132.50. It's a small increase from my previous offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $132.50 is close to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable accepting. I've already offered a compromise, and I don't want to keep lowering my price. I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $132.50 is still below my minimum.  Let's meet in the middle at $133.50.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 133.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still not comfortable with $133.50. I'd be willing to meet you at $132.75, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's still below my ideal price point, $132.75 is just above my minimum and I only have two rounds left. It's better to secure the deal than to risk losing Bob and having to sell to John for a lower price."
