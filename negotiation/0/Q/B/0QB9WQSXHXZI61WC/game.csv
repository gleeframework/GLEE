"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm definitely interested in the product,  $11,500 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $10,500?  I'm confident this price would be a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your budget concerns, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? It's a fantastic product and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny at that price.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still interested in the product, but $11,000 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay. Let's split the difference and go with $10,750. This would be a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal.",10750.0,Bob,4,
