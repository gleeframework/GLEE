"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105? Let's make this happen!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $105 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm happy to pay $95,  let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $95 is closer, but I'm still a little away from where I need to be. Let's meet at $100, that's fair to both of us.",100.0,Alice,5,
