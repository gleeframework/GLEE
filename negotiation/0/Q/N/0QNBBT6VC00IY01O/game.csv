"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I can't go that low.  The product is worth a lot to me, and I'm confident it will be worth that much to you as well.  How about we split the difference and go with $1,050,000? This still leaves a substantial margin for you, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
