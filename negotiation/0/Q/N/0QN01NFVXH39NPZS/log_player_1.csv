Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at a price of $120. I believe it's a fantastic deal, given its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 120
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed. 
* **Anchoring:** By offering a high initial price, I'm trying to ""anchor"" Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept this price, it might make a lower counteroffer seem more reasonable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The significant difference between my asking price ($120) and my minimum ($80) allows for a back-and-forth negotiation where both parties feel like they're getting a fair deal. 
* **Alternative Option:**  I have John as a backup buyer at $80, which gives me leverage. If Bob's offers remain too low, I can always walk away and sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $90 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a decent offer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I started high, and Bob countered with a reasonable jump down.  I'm willing to continue the negotiation to see if I can secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I want to be fair. How about we meet in the middle at $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This strategy often feels fair to both parties. It shows I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price significantly above my minimum. 
* **Incremental Steps:** By reducing my price by $15, I'm demonstrating flexibility but also indicating that I'm not willing to drop to his price immediately.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** I still have John as a backup buyer, reminding me that I don't need to accept an offer below my acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above my budget. How about we try $92? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $92 is a solid profit margin over my minimum of $80. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing the negotiation might only yield small incremental gains. It's likely Bob won't go much higher.
* **Time Value:** Every round of negotiation takes time. Accepting now secures the sale and allows me to move on to other potential deals."
