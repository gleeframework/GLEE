{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

* **Aggressive opening:** Starting low shows you're serious about saving money and forces Alice to negotiate. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:** While $1,000,000 is a significant discount, it's still plausible Alice might accept, especially with 8 rounds remaining.
