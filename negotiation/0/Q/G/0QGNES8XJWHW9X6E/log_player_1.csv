"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so feel free to share your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but reasonable):** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000). This allows room for negotiation and signals that I believe the product is worth a premium.  The price is still within a potentially believable range for a product of this value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The message explicitly states my openness to discussion and encourages Bob to share his thoughts. This sets a collaborative tone for the negotiation.
* **Alternative Option (John):** Having a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000 provides me with a strong fallback position. I can afford to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob, knowing I have a secure alternative."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I can get from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above his perceived value of the product, which is a positive sign. However, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I need to guide the price closer to my target range. I'll use the next round to make a strategic counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective on the value,  I'm aiming for a price closer to $1,800,000.  This product offers significant, unique advantages, and I'm confident it can deliver substantial returns for you.  Are you open to finding a middle ground here?"",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant step down from my initial offer ($2,000,000 to $1,800,000) to demonstrate flexibility and willingness to negotiate. This might encourage Bob to be more open to increasing his offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating the product's unique value and potential benefits for Bob's business. This reinforces its worth and justifies a higher price point.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:**  The message directly proposes finding a ""middle ground,"" signaling my intent to reach a mutually acceptable agreement. This encourages Bob to engage in more active negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,600,000. Can we discuss further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a significant jump from his previous offer and represents a price point above my minimum acceptable threshold. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that we could waste valuable time in further haggling. Accepting this offer ensures a profitable deal and allows me to move forward."
