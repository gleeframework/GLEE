"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down to $900,000.  While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to $750,000 for the product. I think that's a fair price given the value we've discussed.  Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand you're looking to pay closer to $750,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $875,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my initial offer of $750,000.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500? I think that's a fair price considering the value we both see in this product.",812500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get closer to your initial offer, but I'm not comfortable going below $900,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and meet you at $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
