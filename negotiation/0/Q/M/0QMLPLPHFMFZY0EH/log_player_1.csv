Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $12,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  This price is fair for both of us and would allow me to move forward with the purchase.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,500. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I can include a free maintenance package worth $1,000 with the purchase of the product. This brings the total value to $12,500, which is still below my initial offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000 plus the maintenance package, which is a total of $12,000.
