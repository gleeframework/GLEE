The product is worth $80 to me, so $120 is way too much. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70}

I'm offering $70 for the product. This is still a fair price for both of us, as it's less than what I'm willing to pay from John, but also more than what Alice is willing to sell for."

While $110 is better than $120, it's still more than what I'm willing to pay. I'll reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

I'm offering $75. I'm willing to go a little higher than my initial offer, but I'm still hoping to get a better deal than buying from John."

You have three options:

Alice is not budging much on her price, and I'm getting closer to my maximum. It's not worth risking further negotiation. I'll buy the product from John for $80."
