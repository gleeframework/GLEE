"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $800,000 is significantly lower than the product's value to both of us.  It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's room for improvement.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However, $800,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.  To demonstrate my interest, I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is closer to my target price, but it's still not ideal.  I believe there's more room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to counter with a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $975,000.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $975000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a counteroffer of $975050. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still ensuring I earn a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,050
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $975,050 is very close to my last offer of $975,000.  It's a small difference, and continuing to negotiate risks delaying the deal and potentially pushing the price higher. It's a good deal considering the product's value to me and it's better than buying from John at $1,200,000. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
