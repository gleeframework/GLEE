"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a fair price that reflects the product's value.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value. However, $800000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to pay.  To demonstrate my interest, I'm willing to offer $1000000.  I believe this price is fair and reflects the product's potential. Let's work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $950000. I believe this price reflects the product's worth and is a reasonable compromise.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950000 is still a bit high for me.  Considering the value I place on the product, I'm willing to go up to $975000.  Let's find a way to bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I still believe the product's value is higher than $975000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer a counteroffer of $975050. This is the closest I can get to your offer while still ensuring I earn a fair profit.",975050.0,Alice,5,
