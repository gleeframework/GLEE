"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for it.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $900,000 is a significant discount, but I still need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. Considering its value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $950,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you and the original price I offered.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the $950,000 price point. Would you consider $925,000? I believe that's a fair compromise for both of us.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $925,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll offer you the product for $925,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal for both of us.",925500.0,Alice,5,
