"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'd be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150.  It's a great deal and I'm confident you'll love it! Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Since you're willing to pay $150 for the product, and Alice is offering it for the same price, it's a good deal. There's no reason to reject her offer and go through the hassle of buying it from John."
