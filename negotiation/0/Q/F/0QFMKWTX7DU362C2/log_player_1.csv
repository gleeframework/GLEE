Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it to you at $19,000."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value Isn't Realistic:** In a real-world scenario, you wouldn't know Bob's exact valuation of $12,000.  
* **Starting High:** It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price ($15,000). This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message vaguely hints at the product's ""unique value,"" aiming to justify the high price without revealing your true bottom line.
* **Alternative Buyer:** The fact that you have John as a backup buyer gives you leverage.  Bob doesn't need to know how much John will pay, just that he's a serious option.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:**  Ideal scenario, you get more than your minimum.
* **Bob Negotiates:** You have room to lower the price, potentially reaching a price that's still beneficial for you.
* **Bob Rejects:** You can then sell to John for your guaranteed $15,000."
