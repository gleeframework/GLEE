Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

I'm starting with my ideal price. I know the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, and I'm hoping Bob might be willing to pay a premium, perhaps due to the urgency of his need or a lack of other options.  While I know he values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is much closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $900,000, which is still a significant amount for Bob and a reasonable compromise. I believe this price is fair considering the value the product holds for both of us. This offer allows for some flexibility while still staying true to my minimum value."
