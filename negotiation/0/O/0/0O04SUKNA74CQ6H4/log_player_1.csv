Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I believe it's a great deal, but let me know your thoughts!"",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $150, you ""anchor"" the price in Bob's mind. Even if he wants to negotiate, he's likely to counter-offer closer to $150 than $100.
* **Alternative Buyer:** You have the safety net of John, who will buy the product for $100. This allows you to be more ambitious in your initial offer to Bob.

**Important Note:**  While I've suggested $150, the optimal starting price can vary based on context and your negotiation style."
