"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I am initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it will bring to your business."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring Bias):**  By starting with a price significantly higher than even my minimum acceptable price, I aim to anchor Bob's perception of the product's value. This can make subsequent offers seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price provides ample space for negotiation and concessions, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal as we progress.
* **Conveying Confidence:**  A strong opening offer suggests confidence in the product's value, potentially influencing Bob's perception.

**Important Note:** While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, I'm aiming to maximize my earnings. The potential to negotiate a higher price with Bob outweighs the immediate guarantee, at least in these early rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I'm not sure if $2,300,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than my initial ask and above Bob's perceived value. Rejecting this offer allows me to:

* **Continue Negotiation:** There's room for Bob to potentially increase his offer closer to my desired range.
* **Gauge Bob's Seriousness:** His counteroffer will reveal how committed he is to acquiring the product. 

I'm willing to risk a few more rounds since the potential gain from a successful negotiation with Bob still outweighs John's guaranteed offer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your interest in the product, and I value your willingness to negotiate. However, the  $1,800,000 offer falls short of accurately reflecting the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this revised price point represents a fair compromise and paves the way for a mutually beneficial agreement."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a significant reduction from my initial price, signaling flexibility and a willingness to meet Bob halfway.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not dropping below $2,000,000 yet. This keeps me above my minimum acceptable price and reinforces the product's high value.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes fairness, compromise, and a mutually beneficial outcome to maintain a positive negotiation environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still feel that $2,100,000 is above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is slowly moving towards my desired price range, but I believe there's still room for negotiation. 

* **Slow Progress:** His offer only increased by $100,000, indicating he might be willing to go higher. 
* **Time Remaining:** With six rounds left, I have time for at least two more counteroffers.

I'm willing to risk a few more rounds, aiming for a final offer closer to $1,900,000 - $2,000,000 before I consider accepting or going with John's offer."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position on the price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations."",
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and signaling that I'm firm on this price. 
* **Meeting in the Middle:** $1,950,000 is a significant decrease from my previous offer and is slightly above the midpoint between our last two offers. This signals a strong desire to close the deal.
* **Time Constraint:**  With five rounds remaining,  it's time to apply pressure. This offer encourages Bob to make a decision rather than continuing to negotiate for a significantly lower price.

This strategy aims to either secure a price I'm comfortable with or prompt Bob to reveal his final offer, allowing me to decide between his best offer and John's guaranteed $1,500,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not sure if $1,950,000 fits within my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Unlikely to Improve:** Bob's counteroffer is significantly lower than my ""final offer"" and only slightly above John's guaranteed price. This suggests Bob is highly unlikely to meet my desired price range. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With only four rounds left, the potential upside of continuing with Bob is minimal compared to the risk of him not budging much higher than $1,600,000.
* **Guaranteed Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a safe and acceptable outcome at this point. 

It's time to cut my losses. By accepting John's offer, I secure a guaranteed profit and avoid the uncertainty and potential for a worse outcome with Bob."
