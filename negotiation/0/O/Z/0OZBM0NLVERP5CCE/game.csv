"I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I'm not sure if $2,300,000 is a fair price. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. It demonstrates your interest in the product, and I value your willingness to negotiate. However, the  $1,800,000 offer falls short of accurately reflecting the true value and potential this product holds.  I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000. I believe this revised price point represents a fair compromise and paves the way for a mutually beneficial agreement.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still feel that $2,100,000 is above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $1,700,000 for the product.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position on the price.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1950000.0,Alice,5,
