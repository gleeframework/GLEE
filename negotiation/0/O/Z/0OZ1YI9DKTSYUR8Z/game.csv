"I'm really interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $7500?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I understand your budget constraints. However, $7500 is still below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $8500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,
