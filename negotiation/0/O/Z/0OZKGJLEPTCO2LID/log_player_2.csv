"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product I think you might be interested in. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think it's worth a lot more to the right person. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is at your maximum price point. There's no immediate incentive to accept. By rejecting, you open the possibility of a lower price from Alice, potentially saving you some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $150 is a bit steep for me right now. Would you be willing to come down to $125?  I'm really interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? It's still a fair price for the value of this product, and I think we can close a deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial offer of $150 to $135, which is a significant reduction.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a good chance she won't budge much more.  Accepting her offer at $135 saves you $15 compared to buying from John, and it's still within your budget."
