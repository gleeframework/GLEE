"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. This is a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $12,000 is still too high for him, and he can potentially get a better deal by negotiating further. He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $15,000 and Alice values the product at $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know if you're open to that."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I appreciate your offer, $10,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $11,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal for him.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't get him a significantly lower price.  Accepting Alice's offer saves Bob money compared to buying from John."
