Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant return on investment you'll see. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, there's room to potentially earn more from Bob.
* **Strong Starting Point:**  Starting high ($1,100,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message subtly emphasizes the product's value, aiming to justify the high price in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes we have a little time to negotiate with Bob. If there's a strict deadline or we're short on time, it might be safer to offer it directly to John for the guaranteed $1,200,000."
