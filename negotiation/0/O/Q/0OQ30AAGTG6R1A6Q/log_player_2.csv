Given its value and the benefits it provides, we're extending this exclusive opportunity to you at a special introductory price of $110. This is an excellent chance to experience the product's full capabilities at a discounted rate compared to what others might pay later. We're confident it will meet and exceed your expectations. Please let us know if you're interested in taking advantage of this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You're willing to pay up to $120 for the product.  Alice's offer of $110 is better than buying from John, but you can still potentially get a better deal.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you might encourage her to lower the price or you can proceed to negotiate with John."
