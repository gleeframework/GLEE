Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Bob's offer:
