"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I think it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is a better price than Alice's initial value, it's still above Bob's target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in it. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I see in the product. I'm confident you'll find it a great addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target, it's still above his limit. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if Alice is willing to drop the price further. Bob can leverage the fact that he has a fallback option with John, and Alice may want to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you value the product, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,500, which is a significant step closer to your last offer. Let's try to bridge the gap and find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is tempting and getting closer to Bob's target, he's still better off rejecting. He has a solid fallback option with John and only a few rounds left. By rejecting, Bob can attempt to pressure Alice further and potentially get a better price. There's a good chance Alice might be willing to drop a bit more to avoid losing the sale entirely."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $10,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to spend.  I'm willing to offer $9,750.  This is a very fair price considering your last offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. "", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $9,800. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value. I'm getting close to accepting your offer, but I need to hold out for a slightly better price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tricky situation. Bob has reached a point where the negotiation is getting close to his target, but there's a high chance Alice will reject his counteroffer.  Considering:

* **Limited Rounds:** There are only three rounds left. 
* **Risk:** Rejecting and counteroffering again risks Alice walking away, leaving Bob with only John's option.
* **Value:** While $9,800 is close to Bob's target, it's still $1,800 more than what John is offering.

Therefore, the safest and most cost-effective choice is to buy from John.  Bob can secure the product for a guaranteed $8,000, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential rejection."
