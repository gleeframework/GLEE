Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to be reasonable, Bob, and I appreciate that. However, I'm not willing to go all the way down to $6,600. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about we settle at $6,900? It's still a great deal for both of us, and I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,900

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower. Accepting $6,900 saves $1,100 compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
