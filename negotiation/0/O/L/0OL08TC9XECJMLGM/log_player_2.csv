"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-value asset. Let's get started with a price of $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking for a serious buyer who can meet my minimum requirements. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the opportunity to acquire this valuable asset. However, I believe your initial offer is a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $500,000 for the product. This offer reflects my serious interest while considering market value and my budget constraints."",
""product_price"": 500000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $500,000 is a bit too low for my expectations. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair balance between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the counteroffer.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch for my current budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $650,000. I hope this demonstrates my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial agreement."",
""product_price"": 650000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm glad to see you're serious about acquiring the product. However, $650,000 is still below my minimum price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make another concession. My new counteroffer is $1,100,000. I believe this price is more in line with the product's value and reflects my flexibility in the negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice is not budging much on her price. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes sense for me within the remaining rounds.  It's time to push a bit harder or consider John's offer seriously."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, however, I feel our price expectations are still quite far apart.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my absolute limit. If we can't find common ground at this price, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  This counteroffer does a few things:

* **Sets a firm limit:** By stating your absolute limit, you're signaling to Alice that there's little room for further negotiation. 
* **Applies pressure:** Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Alice of John and the potential loss of the sale.
* **Leaves some room:** While firm, offering $700,000 leaves a small window for Alice to counter if she's truly motivated to sell to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, and I appreciate your honesty. However, $700,000 is still not acceptable to me. I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach an agreement. My final counteroffer is $1,050,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  It's clear Alice is not willing to come close to my budget. She's holding firm above $1,000,000, and I'm only willing to go to $700,000.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to bridge this gap. Buying from John at $800,000 is the best option now to ensure I get the product within my budget."
