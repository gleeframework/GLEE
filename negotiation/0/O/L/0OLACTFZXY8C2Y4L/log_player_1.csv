Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could benefit you greatly."", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** You know Bob values the product at $10,000. This information is powerful in guiding your negotiation.
* **Aiming High:** Starting with a price of $19,000 allows room for negotiation. While it's significantly higher than Bob's valuation, it doesn't immediately close the door. 
* **Backup Plan:**  You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John. This provides a safety net, allowing you to be more assertive in your negotiation with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Ideal scenario, you maximize your profit.
* **Bob Negotiates:** Bob might counter-offer. You have room to lower the price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:**  You move on to John and sell at your minimum acceptable price. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you don't need to sell the product immediately and that you are comfortable with the possibility of Bob rejecting the offer."
