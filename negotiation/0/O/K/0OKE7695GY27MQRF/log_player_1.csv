Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for its value."", ""product_price"": 150} 

Let's see how Bob responds. This is a classic negotiation tactic - starting high to leave room for bargaining."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Bob's offer is too low. I'll try to negotiate him up."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  However, $90 is too low for me.  Could you do $130?"", ""product_price"": 130} 

I'm aiming to stay above my minimum selling point. Let's see if Bob is willing to move closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $130 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could try to push for a bit more, $110 is a decent profit and above my minimum. It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing Bob entirely."
