"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to $9,000.  How about we split the difference and go with $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're looking for a price closer to $9,000, but that's still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,750 is closer, it's still a bit too low for me. How about we meet halfway between our last offers and settle for $8,125?",8125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $8,000 is the absolute limit for me.  How about we make it a deal at that price?",8000.0,Bob,6,
