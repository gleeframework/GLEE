"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, $1,200,000 is significantly below its true value and my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to meet you halfway â€“ how about $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,250,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Bob is inching closer, we're still significantly above John's offer. There's room for negotiation, and we're not in a desperate situation yet."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Let's find a middle ground - I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I'm still not convinced that the product is worth that much. I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway from your latest offer. How about $1,225,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting very close to John's offer, we're still in a position to push for a slightly better deal. Bob is clearly interested and willing to negotiate, so it's worth seeing if we can get closer to $1,250,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  Let's settle this - I'm willing to accept $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value."", 
""product_price"": 1250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now at a point where the difference is relatively small. By presenting this as our ""final offer,"" we're hoping to incentivize Bob to close the deal without dragging the negotiation further. It's a calculated risk, as he might reject it, but the potential gain of $50,000 over John's offer makes it worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you're willing to accept $1,250,000, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,235,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,235,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,235,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is unlikely to move significantly from his $1,235,000 offer, and we're running out of rounds. Accepting this offer secures a $15,000 profit over John's guaranteed price. Holding out for more at this point presents a greater risk than reward."
