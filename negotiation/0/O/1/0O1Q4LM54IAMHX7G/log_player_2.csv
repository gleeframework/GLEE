"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you. This item holds significant value to me, but considering its importance to you, I believe we can come to an agreement that benefits both parties. I am offering the product to you for $14,000. I understand it's a bit above the $10,000 value it holds for me, but I hope this price reflects its true worth and the opportunity it presents to you. If you're interested, please let me know so we can proceed with the transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $14,000 is above her perceived value, it's still less than your maximum budget of $15,000 and the guaranteed price from John. Accepting this offer saves you $1,000 compared to buying from John."
