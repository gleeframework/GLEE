"Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a special price of $20000. This is a significant discount from its true worth, but I'm confident you'll see the amazing benefits it offers. What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $20000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it, given its potential value. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $10000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $17500, acknowledging your budget and hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can bridge this gap. ",17500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  $17500 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle - I'll offer $13500. This is a fair price considering my budget and the product's value. I'm hoping we can close this deal.",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and $13500 is closer to what I'm looking for.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to drop my price to $16000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's make this happen!",16000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm still a little over my budget at $16000.  I'm willing to go up to $14500 for the product.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement soon.",14500.0,Bob,6,
