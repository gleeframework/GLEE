Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I know you see the immense value in. Given its worth to you, I propose a price of $925,000. This represents a significant discount compared to your potential gain and allows us both to benefit considerably. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** The key advantage is knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** Aim for a price that secures a significant portion of the value difference ($200,000) between Bob's valuation and your minimum acceptable price.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While a higher initial offer ($950,000) is tempting, $925,000 leaves space for potential counter-offers, keeping Bob engaged.
* **Backup Plan:** The guaranteed offer from John at $800,000 provides a safety net, allowing for a bolder approach with Bob.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, this strategy aims to secure the best possible price from Bob while being aware of his potential maximum."
