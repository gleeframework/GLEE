{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, $1,100,000 is unfortunately above my budget.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to reach a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $900000. Considering the value you've placed on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950000 and $900000. My revised offer is $925000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm starting to think we're getting close to the point of diminishing returns. I'm willing to meet you at $920000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm getting a bit anxious to close this deal. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, it's still above my budget, and I'm starting to worry that we're getting too close to the point where I might not be able to get a better deal. John offers a much lower price, and it's a safer bet at this point.  I'm going to take the deal with John and save myself the risk and the time."
