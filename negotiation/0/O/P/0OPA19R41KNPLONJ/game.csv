"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your initial asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider purchasing it for $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to negotiate, however. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's worth, but I have to stick to my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $950,000 is closer to what I have in mind, I can't accept anything below $1,100,000 for this product. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it brings.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
