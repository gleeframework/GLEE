"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price is still a good deal for you considering your value for it.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000.
