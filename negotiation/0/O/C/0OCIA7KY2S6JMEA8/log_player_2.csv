"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000, which is a fair and reasonable offer considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is too high for Bob. Since Bob has a maximum budget of $1,000,000 and Alice values the product at $1,500,000, there's significant room for negotiation. It's better to reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product, which is my absolute maximum. This price is still a good deal for you considering your value for it."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,000,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still allows you to get a good deal while ensuring I earn a reasonable profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  Since Bob has a guaranteed alternative with John at $1,000,000, it's more advantageous to take the certain deal with John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
