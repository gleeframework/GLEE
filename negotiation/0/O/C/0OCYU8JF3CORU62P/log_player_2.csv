**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $840,000 - $850,000 range.  While we could try to push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely Alice will budge much. Accepting at $840,000 secures a significant savings compared to John's offer and avoids the risk of the negotiation stalling completely."
