"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price that is slightly lower than what Bob is willing to pay, but still above my minimum desired price.  This gives Bob room to negotiate while also demonstrating that I am serious about selling the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'd like to see if I can get a higher price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $92.50? I'm confident you'll find this product very valuable."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $92.50 is still a bit high for me. How about $90?  I'm really interested in this product, but I have a budget to stick to. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $90 is close to my desired price and a good compromise. I'm happy to accept and close the deal."
