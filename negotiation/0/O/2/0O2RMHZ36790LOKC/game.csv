"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to buy it from me for $150?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80, which is the price I can get it for from another seller. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $150 and $100, so I'll offer it to you for $125. Is that something you'd be interested in?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting a bit too far apart, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I'll offer it to you for $115. That's as low as I'm willing to go.",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to go above $90. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me there. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $90?",90.0,Bob,6,
