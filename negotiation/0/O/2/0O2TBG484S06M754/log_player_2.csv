{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is way above your budget. It's best to reject and see if you can negotiate a better price. You have 9 more rounds to try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 47% discount from Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it signals my strong desire to buy the product while setting a firm lower limit.  I'll gauge Alice's response and adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, but it's a good sign that she's willing to negotiate. I'm going to reject and counter-offer again, aiming for a price closer to my desired range. I still have plenty of rounds left, so I can afford to be patient and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, so I'm raising my counteroffer slightly to $950,000. This shows I'm serious about buying the product while keeping my budget in mind. It's also a reasonable middle ground between my last offer and Alice's current price. I'm hoping to get a deal in the next few rounds."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is slowly coming down on the price, but we are still a bit far apart.  It's better to keep negotiating to see if we can get a better deal. I still have 5 rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer to $1,000,000, which is my absolute maximum. If Alice rejects this, I'll go with John's offer as there isn't much room for further negotiation. We are close to a deal, and I want to see if Alice is willing to meet me halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to my maximum price, but it's still higher than John's offer.  I've only got 3 rounds left, and I'm not sure if I can get Alice to budge any further. It's a risk, but I'm going to go with John's offer and secure the product for my target price.  I've made a good effort at negotiating, and it's time to lock in the deal."
