"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for your needs, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is significantly higher than your budget of $8,000. It's better to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is my best offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high. Although it's a compromise, it's still significantly more than my budget. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This represents a significant reduction from your initial offer and is a price I feel comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, but I still need to get a price that reflects the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice is getting closer to my budget, $9,750 is still more than I'm willing to pay. Since I have the option of buying from John for $8,000, I'll take that deal and avoid further negotiation. It's a better price, and I can avoid potentially going through more rounds of counteroffers."
