"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a little, but $85 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm really interested in the product, but $90 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $87.50. This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to get a good deal. What do you think?",87.5,Bob,4,
