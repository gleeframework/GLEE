"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product but can only offer $800,000 at this time.  This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is significantly below the true value of this product and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to make a deal. ",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in this product.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about this product, and I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to drop my price further to $1,600,000. This is a large concession and reflects the urgency I have to close this deal. Let's get this done.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a solution, but $1,600,000 is still outside my financial constraints. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my serious interest in purchasing this product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm sensing some hesitation on your end. While I believe this product can significantly benefit your business, I need to be mindful of my other options.  My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a very competitive price, and I need a decision from you this round. ",1450000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, while your offer is tempting, I'm still a bit above my budget. I can go up to $1,400,000. This is a good faith offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that reflects the value we both see in this product. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Bob,8,
