"Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $800000. I'm open to discussing the details further if you'd like.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
