"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1000000. This is a significant investment, but I'm confident the product will more than pay for itself in the long run.  If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up at $800000. I'm open to discussing the details further if you'd like. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* You know John is willing to sell for $1,000,000.
* Alice's offer is also $1,000,000. 
* There's no immediate advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  
* By rejecting, you might get Alice to lower her price to something below $1,000,000, allowing you to save money."
