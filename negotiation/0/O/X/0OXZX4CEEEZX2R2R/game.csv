"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. Given its immense value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This feels like a fair starting point considering the benefits you'll reap.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down slightly, how about $1,100,000? This reflects the product's true worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice, but $1,100,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
