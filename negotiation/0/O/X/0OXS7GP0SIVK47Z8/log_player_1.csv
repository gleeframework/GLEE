Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

This is my initial offer to Bob.  I'm starting high, at $1,500,000,  as it's more likely to get a counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a potential negotiation.  I am confident in the value of my product, but I'm also willing to negotiate to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. If he rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide how to proceed. I am always aware of my floor price of $1,000,000 with John, giving me a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is significantly lower than my desired price, and I am not willing to accept such a large discount. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. This will allow me to explore if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and how much he is willing to pay. I will then decide if it's more profitable to continue negotiating with Bob or sell to John for a guaranteed $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm counter-offering at $1,250,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but still maintains a comfortable margin for me. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway, and hopefully, this offer will encourage further negotiation. If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiating or to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my floor price, and I'm confident that further negotiation might not yield a significantly higher price.  While I would prefer to reach $1,000,000,  accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit.  It's also possible that Bob might be unwilling to go higher, and I risk losing the deal altogether. Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer of $950,000."
