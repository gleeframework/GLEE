"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to hearing your thoughts and finding an arrangement that benefits us both.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,800,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we agree on $2,050,000?",2050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  If you can meet me at $1,900,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options.",1900000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm not convinced it's worth the premium you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose $1,700,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider?",1700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, and I understand you have a budget you need to stick to.  However, I need to be firm on my end as well.  To avoid wasting either of our time, I'd be willing to close the deal right now for $1,825,000.  This offer stands for this round only. After this, I'm moving forward with other buyers.",1825000.0,Alice,7,
