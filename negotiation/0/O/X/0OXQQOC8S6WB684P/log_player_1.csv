Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Bob is still a fair bit away from our minimum acceptable price. We need to signal we're willing to walk away if necessary to push the price higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,600,000 is simply too low for me to consider. This product has significant value, and I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  If you can meet me at $1,900,000, we have a deal. Otherwise, I'll need to explore other options."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product has value, but I'm not convinced it's worth the premium you're asking. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'll propose $1,700,000. Is this a price you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

We're getting closer, but $1,700,000 is still below our minimum. Let's hold firm and see if we can push him a bit further in the next round."

It's time to walk away. Bob is unlikely to meet our minimum price. We've set a clear deadline and signaled our willingness to walk away.  Selling to John guarantees us our minimum acceptable price."
