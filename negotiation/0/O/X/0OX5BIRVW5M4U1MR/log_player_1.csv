"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:** I'm offering the product at a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($10,000), leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive messaging:** I'm framing the offer as a potential opportunity for Bob, making it more appealing.
* **Open to negotiation:** I'm leaving the door open for Bob to counteroffer, showing flexibility."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and leaves very little room for profit.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob, so I'll counteroffer to try and reach a more agreeable price. 
* **John as a safety net:**  John's offer provides a safety net, but I'm not ready to sell just yet. I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows for some room for negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows a willingness to compromise while maintaining a reasonable profit margin. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage Bob to see it as a win-win situation.
* **Open to further negotiation:** I'm explicitly acknowledging that there's still room for negotiation, indicating I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $10,500 is a good price for you, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $10,000. Can you consider this revised offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** Even though Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Negotiation is still possible:** While Bob's offer is closer, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial price. 
* **John's offer provides a safety net:**  John's offer gives me a good fallback option if I'm unable to reach a satisfactory agreement with Bob."

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your minimum price, but I'm still not comfortable with $10,600. I'm willing to go up to $10,400, which is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me there, I'll consider it a done deal.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Low margin:** Bob's offer of $10,400 is still below my minimum of $12,000.  With only two rounds left, I'm unlikely to get a much higher price from Bob. 
* **Risk of no deal:** If I continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob will reject my next counteroffer, leaving me with no deal.
* **John's offer is secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $12,000,  which is a better outcome than risking a deal with Bob. 
* **Time constraint:**  With only two rounds left, the pressure to close a deal is increasing.  I'm choosing the sure thing with John's offer."
