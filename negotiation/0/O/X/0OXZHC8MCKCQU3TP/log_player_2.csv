"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I see the value in your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?"", ""product_price"": 8000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $14,000 might be a bit too high for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  To be honest, $10,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $11,000. She's made it clear that she needs to get close to her minimum, and $11,500 is likely a strong signal that she won't budge much more.  Since you have a guaranteed option to buy from John at $10,000, it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice.  You'd be leaving money on the table."
