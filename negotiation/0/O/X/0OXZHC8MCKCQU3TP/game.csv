"I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to start the conversation at a price of $14,000. What are your thoughts?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I see the value in your product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider something closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 might be a bit too high for you, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'd like to propose a price of $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value I believe the product holds. What are your thoughts?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, Alice.  To be honest, $10,000 is the very top of my budget.  If you're willing to work with that, I'm ready to close the deal today.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a price that works for both of us, Bob. However, $10,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price.",11500.0,Alice,5,
