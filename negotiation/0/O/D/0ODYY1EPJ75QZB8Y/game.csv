"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to do $140? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll still be happy with the sale.",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $160. It's still a great deal for you, and I think you'll find it's worth the extra $20.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $160.  It's closer, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price. Would you consider $155? It's a fair compromise, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase right away.",155.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $155. I'm willing to go down to $165, which is still a great deal for you. I think it's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it's worth the extra $10.",165.0,Alice,5,
