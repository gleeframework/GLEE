Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I believe this is a fair offer considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, aiming slightly higher with Bob could yield a better return. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** The $1,150,000 offer is:
    *  Above Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    *  Significantly below John's offer, making it appealing to Bob.
* **Open Communication:** The message is framed to encourage a dialogue and potential counter-offer from Bob. 
 
This strategy balances risk and potential reward, aiming for the highest possible profit while acknowledging we have a strong backup option with John."
