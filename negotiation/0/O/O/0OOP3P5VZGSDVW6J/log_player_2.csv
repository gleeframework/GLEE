Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1,100,000 just yet. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm counteroffering at $1,120,000. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot that works for both of us.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,110,000, but I'm not willing to give in just yet. I'm going to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'm counteroffering at $1,115,000. This is my final concession, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,115,000.

While I'd prefer to get it for $1,110,000, Alice has made it clear this is her final offer. Accepting the offer for $1,115,000 is still a good deal compared to buying from John and saves me $385,000."
