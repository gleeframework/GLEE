"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing an initial offer of $1,300,000. I believe this price fairly reflects the product's worth and the significant benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $1,300,000 is significantly higher than his budget of $800,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product. This price reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,175,000. This adjustment reflects my desire to make a deal, while still recognizing the product's significant intrinsic value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,175,000 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still well above Bob's budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further.  There's still room to bargain."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,175,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This shows my genuine interest in purchasing the product, but I need to stay within my budget.  Let's try to find a compromise."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the product's value remains much higher than your offer. To settle this, I propose a final offer of $1,050,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end and ensures a fair deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice's offer is lower than her previous ones, it's still above Bob's budget.  Bob has already rejected a higher offer, so it's unlikely he will accept an offer that is still above his limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still outside of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This offer demonstrates my serious interest in acquiring the product. It's important for us to find common ground, and I believe this price allows for a fair deal while respecting our respective needs."", ""product_price"": 975000}
