"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I do see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That would be a good price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal without needing to explore other options.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a slightly lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1,050,000, I'll accept your offer. If not, I'll need to explore other options.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
