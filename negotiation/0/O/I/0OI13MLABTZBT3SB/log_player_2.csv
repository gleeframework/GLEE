# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. While the product is worth $1,000,000 to you, you can potentially get it for less."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $950,000 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you. What do you think?

While Alice's offer is closer to your ideal price, it's still a bit higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1,025,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping for a slightly lower price.  Would you consider $1,000,000?  That would be a good price for both of us, and it would allow me to close the deal without needing to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire for a slightly lower price, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go without losing too much profit. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to know that you're serious about making a deal. If you're willing to meet me at $1,050,000, I'll accept your offer. If not, I'll need to explore other options.

Alice's final offer is $1,050,000, which is still a bit more than you are willing to pay.  Since you can get the product from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to buy it from him."
