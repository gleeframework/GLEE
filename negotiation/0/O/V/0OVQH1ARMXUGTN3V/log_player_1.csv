Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle?

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $1,400,000? This is a compromise that I think we can both live with.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,400,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling below $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,400,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,450,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,450,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $1,350,000? This is as high as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000.  While I'd like to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offers have been consistently below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering a guaranteed sale at my minimum, and I'm comfortable with that outcome."
