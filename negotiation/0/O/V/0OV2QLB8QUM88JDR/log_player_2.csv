Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $13,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $12,500. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has stated this is her final offer and she's unwilling to go lower than $12,500.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal and save the extra $500."
