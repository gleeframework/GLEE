Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $140. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $100. 
* **John's Offer:** John provides a safety net, ensuring you'll at least get $100.

By offering the product at $140, you're aiming for a price that:

* **Is appealing to Bob:**  It's significantly less than his perceived value.
* **Maximizes your profit:** You're getting $40 more than your minimum acceptable price.

If Bob rejects this offer, you can always fall back on selling to John."
