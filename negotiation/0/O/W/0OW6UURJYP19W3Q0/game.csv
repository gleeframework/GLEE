"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $18,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value of this product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $14,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. How about we meet at $13,500? It's a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting.",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you have a firm budget, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12,800. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",12800.0,Alice,7,
