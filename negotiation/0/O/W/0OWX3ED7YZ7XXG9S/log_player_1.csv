I'm going to try to get a better price than $10,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to go higher."

It seems Bob is firm on his $10,000 offer, and I've already made a significant concession.  I don't want to risk losing more time and potentially getting a lower offer later. John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'll go with the sure thing and sell to him."
