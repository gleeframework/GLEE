"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum ($120). This gives me room to negotiate downward if necessary. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and optimistic message helps build rapport and makes Bob more likely to consider the offer. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  This encourages Bob to respond and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  While it's tempting to take the $120, I'm aiming for a higher profit. 
* **Negotiation is possible:**  Bob's message indicates he's interested. There's room to negotiate a price closer to my initial asking price.
* **More rounds available:** With 9 rounds left, I have time to explore other price points and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is my minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $150? That's still a great deal for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with."", ""product_price"": 150} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm not accepting Bob's offer yet, but I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price.
* **Midpoint:**  $150 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, demonstrating I'm willing to compromise.
* **Appeal to Value:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob, emphasizing that $150 is still a good deal for him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $150 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still room for negotiation:** While $130 is closer to my minimum, I'm still within my desired profit range and believe I can get a better price.
* **Counter-offer strategy:**  By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counter-offer, I show that I'm committed to getting the best deal possible.
* **Limited rounds left:**  With 6 rounds remaining, I have time to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $140? It's a fair price for both of us and we can get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm again offering a middle ground, showing flexibility and willingness to find a solution.
* **Urgency:** The phrase ""get this deal done"" subtly implies that I might be willing to take the $140 to avoid further negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I emphasize the ""fair"" aspect of the price to appeal to Bob's sense of compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider a price of $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my target:**  $135 is very close to my desired profit margin, and only $15 less than my initial offer.
* **Limited rounds:** With only 4 rounds left, I risk losing time and potentially ending up with John's offer of $120.
* **Possible counteroffer:** While I could reject and counter-offer again, there's a chance Bob might walk away, leading me to John's offer.  It's better to secure this slightly lower price than risk losing the deal entirely."
