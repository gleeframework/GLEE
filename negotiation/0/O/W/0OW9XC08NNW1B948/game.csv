"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product, but my budget is quite limited. Could we perhaps meet somewhere in the middle? I'd like to propose a price of $10000. I hope this suggestion is acceptable.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. How about we meet at $18000? It's a fair compromise, considering the product's value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $18000 is still above my budget, I would like to suggest a price closer to what I can afford. Would $15000 be too low, or could we find a mutually agreeable price?",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, considering the product's value. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $16500? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a price that reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation efforts. I've considered your latest offer, and while I appreciate the compromise, I believe we can reach an even better agreement. Would $15500 be within your consideration range?",15500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $15500 is still a bit higher than my target, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $16000? It's the highest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,7,
