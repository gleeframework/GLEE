"Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product for $130. It's worth every penny, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",130.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $130 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $115?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find another buyer if that doesn't work for you.",115.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $115 is a bit too low for me, though. How about we split the difference and go with $117.50? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let me know what you think!",117.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $117.50 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $115. If you're not comfortable with that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",115.0,Bob,4,
