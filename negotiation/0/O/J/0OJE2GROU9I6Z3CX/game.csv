This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $800,000. I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $800,000. This is a great compromise, considering its true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,3,
