Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I'm confident it will be highly beneficial to you.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $925,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing the worth:** I know the product's value to Bob ($1,000,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Aiming high:** Starting with a strong offer ($925,000) leaves room for negotiation while ensuring a significant profit if Bob accepts. 
* **Finding a balance:** This price gives Bob a potential $75,000 saving while I make $125,000 more than selling to John.
* **Open to discussion:**  The tone of the message invites Bob to engage and potentially counter-offer, leading to a mutually beneficial agreement."
