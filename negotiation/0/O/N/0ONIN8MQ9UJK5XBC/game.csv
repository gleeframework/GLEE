"Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this item.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still outside my price range. I'm sticking to my initial offer of $8,000.  I understand this is a significant difference, but it's the absolute maximum I can afford. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll need to explore other options.",8000.0,Bob,4,
