"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I think it would be incredibly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $20,000, which reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is far too high.**  You are only willing to spend $8,000 maximum, and Alice is asking for $20,000.  
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.**  This gives you the chance to get a better price.
* **Buying from John is always an option.** This is a safety net if the negotiation with Alice fails."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000. This is my maximum budget, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on this item."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This is a compromise, and I'm confident it's a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your maximum budget of $8,000.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps negotiation open.** It's worth seeing if Alice will come down further.
* **Buying from John is still a good backup.** If negotiations fail completely, you can always go with John."
