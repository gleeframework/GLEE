"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,050,000. This would still give you a good profit and allows me to get a better deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This price still allows me to make a profit and keeps the deal attractive for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get the product for $1,075,000.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's see if we can agree on this price.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,075,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,087,500. This is a fair compromise, and it allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1087500.0,Alice,5,
