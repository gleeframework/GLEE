"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice, as you can potentially get a better price than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still within the range where the deal is potentially beneficial for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise. It's a better deal than John's offer, and there's a risk of further negotiation with Alice could lead to a stalemate or even a higher price."
