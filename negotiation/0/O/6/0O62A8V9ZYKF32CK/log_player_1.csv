"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't accept a price that's so far below my minimum. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still holding firm on a price that's fair for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is starting to move closer to a price I'm comfortable with, $110 is still below my minimum. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but if he doesn't come up further, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm making another counteroffer, bringing the price down to $140. I'm showing that I'm serious about making a deal with Bob, but I'm still holding out for a price that's closer to my value.  This is a significant move, and I'm hoping it's enough to get Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is not willing to meet me halfway, and I've already lowered my price significantly.  I'm running out of time, and I can't risk losing this deal entirely. Selling to John is the best option to ensure I get a price I'm comfortable with."
