{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to me, and Alice is offering it for $175. This is far too high. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm offering Alice $100 for the product. This is the maximum I'm willing to pay, as it's the price I could get it for from John.  Let's see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $160
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $160 is closer to my desired price, it's still too high. I'll reject Alice's offer and continue to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $110,  demonstrating my willingness to compromise.  This is still a significant saving for Alice compared to her initial offer and hopefully will be more appealing."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is a lot closer to my desired price, it's still above my maximum value. I'm not willing to go above $100.  I'll reject her offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm raising my offer slightly to $105.  This is still well below Alice's offer and demonstrates that I'm flexible and willing to work with her.  Hopefully, this compromise will be enough to secure the deal."
