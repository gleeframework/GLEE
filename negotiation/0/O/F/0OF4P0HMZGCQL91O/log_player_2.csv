"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $145. I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too close to my maximum budget. I'll try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $145 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider selling it for $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
``` 

I'm starting with a lower offer to see how much room for negotiation there is. I want to stay well below my budget to allow for counteroffers from Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $110 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a little. How about $135? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $135 is still too high. I'll continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $122?"",
""product_price"": 122
}
``` 

I'm proposing a price slightly above the middle ground between our previous offers. This shows willingness to compromise while still aiming for a good deal."
