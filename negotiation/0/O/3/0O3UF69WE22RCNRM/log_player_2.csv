"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000.  Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is below your maximum budget, you can do better. You know John is willing to sell the same product for $1,200,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the door for potential negotiation or can proceed to buy from John at a lower price."
