Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,000,000 (your value) because you have a guaranteed buyer in John.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Space:** There's a potential $200,000 difference where both you and Bob can benefit.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, but you also don't want to scare Bob away with an unreasonably high price. Here's a balanced approach:

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Considering its potential value, I believe a price of $1,150,000 is fair. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Direct and Confident:** You clearly state your offer and position the product as valuable.
* **High but Reasonable:**  $1,150,000 allows you to capture a significant portion of the value difference while still leaving Bob with a potential $50,000 gain.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) encourages Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly higher.
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a less aggressive approach might be better.

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate further if Bob counters."
