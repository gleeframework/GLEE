Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible while still exceeding her minimum selling price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, giving Alice a chance to slightly lower the price while staying above her minimum.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to accept a low offer from Bob.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
