Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1300000 is unfortunately too far off from what I'm looking for.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1500000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the product's value fairly. What do you say?
