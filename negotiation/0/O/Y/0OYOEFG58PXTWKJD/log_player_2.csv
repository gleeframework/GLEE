Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I have to consider the value I've attached to this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than $8000 to make it worth my while. How about we discuss a price of $12000? It's a fair compromise, and I think it's a great opportunity for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're still trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but I'd like to propose a slight twist. I'll throw in an additional service or warranty that's worth $1000, which would bring the total value to $11000. This way, you'll get the product at a price that's still within your budget, and I'll get the minimum value I'm looking for. What do you think?
