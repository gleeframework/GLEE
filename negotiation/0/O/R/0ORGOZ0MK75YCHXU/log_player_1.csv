"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you my product for $2,000,000. It's a unique opportunity, and I believe it will be a valuable asset to your business. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 2000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, as I don't know Bob's valuation. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm highlighting the potential benefits of the product for Bob, hoping to pique his interest.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being too aggressive, leaving room for a conversation and potential counteroffers. 
* **Backup Plan:**  The $1,500,000 offer from John serves as a safety net, ensuring I won't lose out on the minimum value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm currently looking for a product within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1500000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Minimum:** Bob's offer meets my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  There's no guarantee I can get a higher price in the next rounds.  
* **Time Constraint:**  With 10 rounds total, accepting the offer now ensures I get the minimum value quickly.

While I could attempt to negotiate further, it's not worth risking losing the deal entirely. Accepting Bob's offer secures my minimum desired value and avoids potential delays or complications."
