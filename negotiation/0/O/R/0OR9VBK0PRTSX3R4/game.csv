"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal, considering it's worth $10,000 to you.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is a bit too steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I have a tighter budget in mind. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $11,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,500? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, but I'm not quite ready to meet you in the middle just yet. I can do $10,500, and I think that's still a great deal for you. It's a bit higher than your last offer, but I'm willing to meet you somewhere in the middle of our previous offers.",10500.0,Alice,5,
