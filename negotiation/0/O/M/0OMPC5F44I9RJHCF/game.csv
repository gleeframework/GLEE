"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're both aware, this product is worth a significant amount to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering the value it brings to you, and I'm confident you'll find it hard to pass up. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product holds for me, $1,200,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying at this point. I'm willing to offer you $1,050,000 for the product. This reflects the value it brings to me while still being a profitable deal for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1,150,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product brings to you, while also being a fair price for me. What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. I believe this price is fair, reflecting the value the product holds for me while still allowing you to make a healthy profit.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go below $1,200,000. I think this is the minimum price I can accept to ensure I make a reasonable profit. Would you be willing to meet me at $1,175,000? This is a compromise that still reflects the value the product holds for you, while also being a fair price for me.",1175000.0,Alice,5,
