"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $11,000 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $13,000. This is still a great price for such a valuable product, and I believe it's fair for both of us. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $13,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, and I think this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
