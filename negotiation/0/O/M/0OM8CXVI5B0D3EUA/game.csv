"I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a price of $18000.",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, but $18000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in the product but would need a lower price to consider it. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can come to an agreement.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we meet in the middle at $12000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not comfortable going as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14000 and $12000, which would be $13000. This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to accept it. Let's finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice, but $13000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably afford. As a final offer, I'm willing to pay $11000 for the product.  I believe this price is fair and reflects a compromise from both of us.  If we can't agree on this, I'll have to explore other options.",11000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $12500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",12500.0,Alice,7,
