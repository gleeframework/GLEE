Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the product for $10,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, there's no incentive to go lower. 
* **Strong Stance:** Starting at your desired price sets a strong negotiating position.  
* **Potential for Bob:** While Bob values it at $8,000, there might be intangible benefits he hasn't factored in, making him willing to pay slightly more. 
 
**Important Note:** This assumes you want to close a deal quickly. If you have time and are willing to negotiate, you could start higher to leave room for bargaining."
