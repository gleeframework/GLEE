"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still more than the product is worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation, so rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy for this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  Would you be willing to go down to $13,000?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I'm eager to find a price that works for us, $13,000 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price:**  $13,500 is a good compromise and a significant improvement from Alice's initial offer of $14,000.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to reject offers and counteroffer could lead to a stalemate or Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further.
* **Alternative option:**  While buying from John for $15,000 is an option, accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $1,500. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most beneficial decision for Bob in this round."
