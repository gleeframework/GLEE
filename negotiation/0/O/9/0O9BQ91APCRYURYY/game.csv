"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you say?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
