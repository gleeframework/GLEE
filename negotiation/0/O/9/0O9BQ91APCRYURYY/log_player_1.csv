Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$14,000 is a good starting point:** It's a fair price that's a bit lower than Bob's estimated value, but still significantly above my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I'm not giving away too much.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message is friendly and highlights the value Bob will receive. This helps encourage him to accept the offer. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:**  By not setting an absolute final price, I'm leaving room for Bob to make a counteroffer if he's not happy with the initial price. This gives me a chance to negotiate further.
* **Having a backup plan:** I'm always aware that John is a backup option, so I'm not pressured to accept a price that's too low for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $12,500 is still above my minimum, it's much closer to John's offer.  I'm not desperate to sell and I believe there's potential to get a better price. 
* **Counteroffer strategy:** I want to see if I can negotiate a higher price. By rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer, I'm showing him that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not willing to settle for a low price. 
* **Maintaining the advantage:** While selling to John is always an option, I want to maximize my profit.  Continuing the negotiation gives me the opportunity to potentially secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and meet at $13,250?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer rationale:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also showing him that I'm open to negotiation. My counteroffer is $750 above his offer, which is half the difference between our initial offers. This suggests a willingness to compromise while also aiming for a better deal.
* **Positive and persuasive message:** The message remains friendly and highlights the fairness of my counteroffer. I emphasize the ""split the difference"" approach, making it seem like a logical solution.
* **Staying above minimum:** My counteroffer is still well above my minimum of $12,000, so I'm not risking selling at a loss.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** I'm still open to further negotiation, but I'm establishing a clear expectation of the price range I'm willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my goal:**  While $13,000 is not my ideal price, it's very close to my counteroffer of $13,250 and significantly above my minimum of $12,000. 
* **Avoiding further negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could risk Bob walking away or lowering his offer further.  It's likely that a counteroffer would be met with another rejection, creating a stalemate.
* **Balancing profit and certainty:**  Accepting Bob's offer ensures a solid profit and avoids the risk of selling to John for a lower price. It's a good compromise that secures a favorable deal."
