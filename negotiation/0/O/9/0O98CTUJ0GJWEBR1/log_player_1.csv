{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you, and this price reflects its significant value."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $800,000 (your guaranteed sale to John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  You want to capture as much of the difference between Bob's valuation and your minimum as possible. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a significant profit for you.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between a high initial offer and the potential for negotiation, maximizing your potential earnings from the sale."
