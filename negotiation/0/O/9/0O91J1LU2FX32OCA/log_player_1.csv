"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $140 for it, which I think is a fair price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's closer to my ideal price point than my minimum. I'm hoping to get as much as possible, but I'm also open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested, but I can only pay up to $125 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price before accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're interested.  I'm willing to go down to $135 for the product, but that's my final offer. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 
I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm willing to compromise a little bit.  I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob."
