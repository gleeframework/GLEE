"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $14,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",14500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're willing to go up to $14,500, but I'm not quite ready to meet you there yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $15,200. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",15200.0,Alice,5,
