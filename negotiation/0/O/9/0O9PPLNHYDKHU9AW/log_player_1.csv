Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true value and potential for you."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product is highly sought after.
* **Justification:**  While I don't want to reveal my bottom line, vaguely mentioning ""true value"" and ""potential"" aims to make the price seem less arbitrary to Bob.
* **Backup Plan:** It's important to remember I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000. This allows me to be bold in my initial offer to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. How I proceed will depend entirely on Bob's response and negotiation tactics."
