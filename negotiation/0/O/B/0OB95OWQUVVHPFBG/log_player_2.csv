"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth no more than $15,000 to Bob. Alice's initial offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum value.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to get the best possible deal, and he believes the product is worth no more than $15,000.  He's starting with a low counteroffer of $10,000. This is likely too low for Alice, but it establishes a starting point for negotiation and leaves room for compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $17,500 is closer to Bob's maximum value of $15,000, it's still higher.  Bob has more rounds available and can continue to negotiate. Rejecting the offer gives him the chance to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his counteroffer, but still staying below his maximum value of $15,000.  $13,000 is a reasonable compromise point, showing Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but is not willing to pay her full asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $16,000 is still above Bob's maximum value of $15,000. Although it's getting closer, Bob can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. He has several rounds left and can try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is steadily increasing his offer, showing willingness to compromise while still remaining below his maximum value of $15,000.  $14,500 is a reasonable middle ground, putting pressure on Alice to accept while leaving room for a potential final compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,500 is only $500 above Bob's maximum value.  Bob is very close to his limit, but with only three rounds left, he should continue to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows him to try and get closer to his target price. It's possible Alice might be willing to go lower to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has reached his maximum value for the product. He needs to get this deal finalized, but he's trying to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $15,000 gives him a chance to secure the product at his limit. If Alice doesn't accept, Bob has only two rounds left, and he might have to purchase from John at a higher price."
