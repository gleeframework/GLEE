"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to acquire this unique product. Its value is significant, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. Given its potential, I propose a starting price of $1,150,000. This seems like a fair reflection of its worth to both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to commit to the price. Considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I propose a counteroffer of $1,075,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1075000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective, the product's value goes beyond simply splitting the difference. Its unique features and potential warrant a price closer to your own valuation. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000.  This reflects my commitment to reaching a mutually beneficial deal.",1120000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, I'm still not comfortable with the current offer. Considering the product's value to me is capped at $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's worth to me.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
