"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $900,000 is a tempting offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.  This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,150,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $950,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest,  anything under $1,000,000 just wouldn't be fair to the value of this product. If you're able to meet me at that price, the deal is yours.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
