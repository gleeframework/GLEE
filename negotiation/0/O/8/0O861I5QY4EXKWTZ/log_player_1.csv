{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but it's not unreasonable given the product's worth to me. It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in your product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum price.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  Let's try $1,050,000.  This price is still within a reasonable range given the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. "", ""product_price"": 1050000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm proposing $950,000. Can you consider this revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my minimum price, it's still below my target.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure a guaranteed sale, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,000,000."
