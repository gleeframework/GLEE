"Hey Alice, that's a great price, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? I'm really interested in this product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $8,500 is just a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? That's still a great price for you and allows me to make a fair profit.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm still a little high on $9,000 though. How about we split the difference at $8,750? It's a fair price for both of us and gets this deal done.",8750.0,Bob,4,
