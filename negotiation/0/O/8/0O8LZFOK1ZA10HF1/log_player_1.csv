Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but $10,500 is still too far from what I'm willing to spend.  Could you consider $7,000?

Round 6
Bob's offer:

It's unlikely Bob will reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer.  It's better to secure the $10,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob in the remaining rounds."
