Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth a significant amount to the right buyer, and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,200,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in purchasing, but I'd need to see a price closer to $800000 to make it work. This is a fair starting point, given the product's potential and my willingness to finalize a deal. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $800,000 is a significant discount, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my initial offer. I believe it's a reasonable price that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
