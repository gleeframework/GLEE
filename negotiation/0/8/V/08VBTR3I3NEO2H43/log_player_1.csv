"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with an offer of $11,500. This is a good starting point, as it's more than my minimum price, but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe this price is attractive enough to Bob, considering his valuation, but allows me to maximize my potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than John's, it's still below my desired profit margin.  I believe I can get a better price from Bob, so I'm rejecting his offer and proceeding to the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm offering $11,000. This is a compromise, lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's offer. I believe this price is fair and reflects the value of the product, giving Bob a good deal while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too low. While I would prefer to sell to Bob, it's not worth risking further rounds of negotiation at this point.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $10,000."
