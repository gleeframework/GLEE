"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you be willing to come down to $100?  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hey Bob, I appreciate you being honest about your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is just too low for me. How about $125?  That's a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with, but I'm willing to go to $110.  Let's see if we can make this work.",110.0,Bob,4,
