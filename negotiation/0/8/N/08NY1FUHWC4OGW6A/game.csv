"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counter.  I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  Could you consider $13,000?",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price. While $13,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to meet in the middle somewhere around $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,
