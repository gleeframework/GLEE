"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. While I can't disclose specifics without a non-disclosure agreement, I can assure you it's worth no less than $1000000 to me. I'm willing to offer it to you at $1500000. This is a significant opportunity, and I'm confident you'll see the potential. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than the maximum you're willing to pay ($1,200,000).  It's better to reject her offer and buy the product from John for a lower price."
