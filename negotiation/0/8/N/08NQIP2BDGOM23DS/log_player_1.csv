"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $13,000. This leaves room for negotiation and is still significantly higher than my minimum value for the product.  This should give Bob a good incentive to negotiate, while also demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get more.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counter and potentially get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,500. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise, but still maintains a value closer to my initial offer. This shows I'm serious about closing the deal but also not willing to undervalue the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Although $11,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hesitant to sell at that price.  I believe I can get closer to my desired price by continuing the negotiation.  This will also give me more information about Bob's willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm counter-offering with $12,000.  This is a middle ground between my last offer and Bob's current offer. It shows that I'm still willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to drastically lower my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a point where the negotiations are getting close to my minimum value, but I'm not confident I can get a higher price from Bob.  Selling to John for $10,000 guarantees me a sale and ensures I don't risk losing out entirely by continuing to negotiate."
