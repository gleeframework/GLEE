Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will greatly benefit you. I'm asking for $1,300,000. This is a limited-time offer, so I encourage you to act quickly."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start the negotiation significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Justification for the price:** The message vaguely hints at the ""unique value proposition"" to pique Bob's interest without revealing specific details. 
* **Urgency and exclusivity:** Creating a sense of urgency and exclusivity can encourage Bob to make a decision quickly and potentially accept a higher price.
* **Room for negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. You can always come down to a price closer to $1,000,000 and still make a significant profit.

This strategy aims to maximize your profit by first attempting to sell above Bob's valuation. If Bob rejects the offer, you have the security of John's guaranteed purchase at your minimum acceptable price."
