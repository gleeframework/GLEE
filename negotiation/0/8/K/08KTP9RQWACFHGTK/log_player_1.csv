{""message"": ""Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but I'm still not quite comfortable with your last offer.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,087,500.  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1087500}

While I'd prefer a higher price, it's becoming increasingly likely Bob will walk away.  This offer is only $20,000 below my last counteroffer and is a much better deal than selling to John.  It's time to close the deal."
