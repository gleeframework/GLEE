"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, you can potentially get it for less.  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you can try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $950,000. This is a bold move, but I'm aiming to get Alice to meet me closer to my ideal price of $1,000,000.  It's a strong opening move that shows I'm serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer. While I can still try to negotiate further, the risk is that she might reject my next counteroffer, and I might end up having to buy from John for $1,000,000. It's safer to accept this offer and secure the product at a price that is within my budget and significantly lower than the original asking price."
