"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's designed to enhance your daily routine and bring convenience to your life. Considering its value and the benefits it offers, I propose a price of $95 for this exceptional item. I believe this is a fair deal that respects both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as cheap as possible, and he's willing to pay up to $80. Alice's offer of $95 is above his limit.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the features of the product, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. If that works for you, we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 80}
