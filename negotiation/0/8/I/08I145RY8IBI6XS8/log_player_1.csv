I'm starting high, knowing the product is worth at least $100 to me. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to adjust the price if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $100. I'm going to try to get closer to my goal by sending a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}

I'm lowering my price a bit from the initial offer, but still staying above my minimum. This shows flexibility while maintaining my desire to maximize profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm lowering my offer again, but this time I'm hitting my minimum acceptable price. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go lower. I'm hoping Bob will accept and we can close the deal."
