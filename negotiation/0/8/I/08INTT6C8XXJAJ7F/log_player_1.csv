Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value ($1,000,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for a deal:**  The offer is high enough that I can make concessions if Bob counters, potentially reaching a mutually beneficial price.
* **Knowing the alternative:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which sets a floor for my negotiations.

**Next steps:**

* I will observe Bob's response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If he rejects, I will analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. 
* I will be careful not to go too low too quickly, as I want to maximize my profits. However, I will also be mindful of the possibility that the deal might fall through, so I will be willing to compromise if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $900,000 is below my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's counteroffer shows he's interested, and I can likely get a higher price with further negotiation.
* **Not rushing into a deal:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 is a guaranteed outcome, but I believe a higher price is achievable with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my desired range.
* **Assess Bob's willingness:** I will carefully observe Bob's reactions and responses to gauge his true valuation of the product. 
* **Stay prepared to sell to John:** While I'm optimistic about getting a better deal with Bob, I'm aware that selling to John is always a viable option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer ($1,500,000) and Bob's offer ($900,000). This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Testing the waters:**  $1,200,000 is a significant price, but it allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness about the deal. If he's truly interested, he should be willing to meet me somewhere in the middle. 
* **Leaving space for negotiation:** This counteroffer still allows for further negotiation, should Bob be willing to raise his offer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** I will carefully observe his reaction to this counteroffer and decide my next move based on his response. 
* **Prepare for potential scenarios:** I'm ready to potentially make further concessions if necessary, but I'm also prepared to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet me closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Limited room for improvement:** While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still a significant amount less than what I'd prefer. Bob's persistence with such a low offer suggests he's unlikely to budge much further.
* **Guaranteed outcome:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob, which could lead to a lower price or a dead end. 
* **Time is valuable:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob could be time-consuming and potentially lead to a worse outcome. Selling to John allows me to move on quickly and secure a solid price.

**Next Steps:**

* I will sell the product to John and close the deal. 
* I will continue to monitor the market and be open to future opportunities to potentially sell similar products at a higher price."
