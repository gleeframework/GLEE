``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.  It also sets a clear price expectation from the beginning."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate it, but I can only pay up to $90 for the product. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $120. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I can definitely consider $95, but I would like to stick to my budget of $80. Would you be able to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $85 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can negotiate a better deal.  I'm not willing to settle for anything below $100 at this point, as I could sell to John for $120."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $85 just isn't going to work for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $92.50? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
