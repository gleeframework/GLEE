Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's something truly special, and I believe it could be a game-changer for your business. I'm asking for $1,500,000 for it. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm opening with a price above my minimum ($1,200,000) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive tone:**  A friendly and enthusiastic approach can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to engage.
* **Highlighting value:**  I emphasize the product's potential benefits for Bob's business to pique his interest. 
* **Setting a clear price:** This establishes my starting point and allows Bob to consider his options."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the uniqueness of the product you're offering. However, given my budget constraints, I can only consider purchasing the product for $1400000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I still have room to negotiate.  I believe I can get a higher price. By rejecting his offer, I can make a counteroffer that reflects the product's true value and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $1,450,000, but I believe this is the lowest I can go while still reflecting the true value of this product.  It's a significant investment, but I truly think it will be worth it for you in the long run."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price but not compromising too much.
* **Emphasizing value:** I reiterate the product's potential benefits to justify the price.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This counteroffer leaves some space for further discussion if needed, but keeps the price above my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my assessment of the product's value to me, I would like to propose a purchase price of $1425000. I hope this aligns better with our respective positions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,425,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,425,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While I could try to negotiate further, the risk of him walking away or me needing to sell to John for a lower price is increasing.  Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a profit."
