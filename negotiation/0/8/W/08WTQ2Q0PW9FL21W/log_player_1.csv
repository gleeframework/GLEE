"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you.  I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I believe this is reflective of its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 1600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an ambitious offer. This anchors the negotiation higher and leaves room for concessions. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's ""value and potential,"" I'm aiming to frame the price as justified rather than arbitrary.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The $1,600,000 offer is significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,200,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), allowing space for bargaining.
* **Alternative Option:**  The knowledge that I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000 gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the product's value, but that price is too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $800,000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($1,000,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'm better off rejecting this lowball offer and proposing a counter-offer that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?"", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting the Lowball:** By rejecting Bob's offer outright, I signal that I'm serious about obtaining a fair price. 
* **Concession:**  I've reduced my price by $200,000, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. 
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing technique aims to create a sense of fairness and compromise, even though the proposed price is still significantly closer to my initial offer. 
* **Time Constraint:** I'm aware of the 10-round limit and the option to sell to John. While I want to maximize profit with Bob, I need to make progress in each round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,400,000 is closer, it's still above my budget.  I can do $900,000.  That's a significant investment on my part and demonstrates my serious interest in the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Slow Progress:** Bob increased his offer by only $100,000. This suggests he's not significantly budging, and at this rate, we're unlikely to reach a deal close to my minimum within the remaining rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** I still have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000. The difference between Bob's current offer and John's is significant enough to warrant continued negotiation. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting this offer, I reiterate that I'm seeking a price closer to my initial proposal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant concession. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  If you're willing to move to $1,200,000, we have a deal."", 
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Time Pressure:**  With fewer rounds remaining, I'm increasing the pressure by explicitly mentioning the other buyer (John). This creates urgency and signals that my current price is firm.
* **Final Offer:**  I'm offering the product at my absolute minimum price ($1,200,000). This shows Bob I'm serious about closing the deal but not willing to go any lower.
* **Clear Choice:**  I'm framing this as a ""take it or leave it"" offer, pushing Bob to make a decision. He either meets my price, or I'm likely to walk away and sell to John."
