Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need a price that reflects its true worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,400,000?

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but we're still quite far apart. I've already made a significant concession. To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I value our discussions and believe this product would be a great fit for you.  If you're willing to move to $1,200,000, we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is down to her lowest acceptable price ($1,200,000), which is still above your maximum budget.  While she mentions another buyer, this could be a negotiation tactic. You have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000, ensuring you stay within budget."
