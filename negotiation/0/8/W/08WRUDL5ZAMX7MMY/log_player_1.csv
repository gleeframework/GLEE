"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $15,000 to me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but it's still lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I make a profit. I'm also emphasizing the value of the product to build trust and encourage Bob to consider my offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly below my minimum. I'm confident I can do better with further negotiation, especially since I've established a baseline price. I'm also aware that selling to John is always an option, which gives me leverage in this negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone."", ""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm lowering my price to $13,000, which is still above my minimum and shows flexibility, but also makes it clear that I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. The message focuses on a collaborative approach and emphasizes fairness to encourage Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a good price for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $15,000.  The negotiations are going well so far, and I'm confident I can reach a more favorable outcome with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let's make it happen!"", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm raising my counteroffer to $13,500. This is still below what I want, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise and signals that I'm serious about closing the deal.  The message emphasizes a fair price and emphasizes closing the deal, hopefully encouraging Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can we try to meet at $12,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $12,250 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough for me.  I have the option to sell to John for $15,000, which gives me the leverage to hold out for a better price. I'm also confident that I can still persuade Bob to come up a bit more with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal and move on."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm lowering my offer again to $13,000, but this is my final concession. I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the time invested in the negotiation to create a sense of urgency and pressure on Bob to accept. I'm also highlighting the value of the product to remind him of its worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm still not willing to pay $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think we can do better than that. Can we try $12,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of rounds and Bob's offer is still below my minimum. While I'd like to get closer to my ideal price, I'm not willing to risk going any lower and ending up with a deal that's not worth it.  Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees me a good profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation."
