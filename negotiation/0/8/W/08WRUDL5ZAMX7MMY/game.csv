"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $14,000.  It's a great deal for a product that's worth at least $15,000 to me.  What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. That's the most I'm willing to pay for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,000 simply isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price for both of us.  Let's find a solution that works for everyone.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still thinking $12,000 is a good price for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $12,500?",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good deal, and I respect that.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,500. This would be a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal. Let's make it happen!",13500.0,Alice,5,

"I understand you're trying to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Can we try to meet at $12,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",12250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close! I'm willing to make one final concession and offer $13,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product and the time we've spent negotiating. Let's finalize this deal and move on.",13000.0,Alice,7,
