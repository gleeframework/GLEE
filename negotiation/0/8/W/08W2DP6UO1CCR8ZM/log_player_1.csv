Round 4

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  We're running out of time, and I'm not confident I'll be able to get Bob to meet my price.  While it's frustrating to leave money on the table, it's important to prioritize getting the best deal possible, and John's offer is the best one I have right now."
