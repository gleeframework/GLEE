"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than what others might pay for it. Considering its true worth and your interest, I am offering it to you for $100. This is a special opportunity to own a product valued at $120 by you, at a price that reflects its quality and significance to you. Please let me know if this offer suits your expectations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $100 is lower than your maximum budget of $120, you know you can get the product for $120 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you create the opportunity for her to potentially offer a lower price, getting you a better deal."
