"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it!  I'm offering it to you for $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above Bob's perceived value ($120) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive tone can help build rapport and make Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room:** A $140 price leaves space for me to potentially negotiate down if necessary. 
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm also aware that I have a backup option with John, who's willing to pay my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While $130 is closer to my minimum value ($150), it's still below what I'd like to get. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. I have 8 rounds left, which gives me time to work towards a more acceptable offer.
* **John as a Backup:**  Even though Bob's offer is closer, John is still a good safety net if the negotiation with Bob doesn't yield a better result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $130 is a little too low for me right now.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $135?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** I'm proposing a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($140) and Bob's offer ($130). This shows a willingness to compromise and makes it seem like I'm trying to reach an agreement.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and friendly tone to keep the negotiation amicable.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing the offer as a fair price for both of us, which can appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $135 is still above my minimum, giving me a buffer in case Bob needs more convincing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $132? I'm really interested in this product, and I'd like to make a deal with you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob is getting closer, $132 is still below my minimum acceptable price.
* **Room for Negotiation:** I have 6 rounds remaining, which means there's still time to try and push for a higher price.
* **John's Offer:**  If I can't get a better price from Bob, I can always sell to John for $150. 

**I want to try to push for a price closer to $135 before considering selling to John.**"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $132 is still just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further to $134, but that's my final offer. I'm confident this product will be worth it for you, and I'd hate to miss out on this opportunity to work with you."", ""product_price"": 134}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Finality:**  I'm positioning this as my ""final offer"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight Compromise:** I'm only lowering my price by a dollar, showing that I'm willing to meet halfway but also emphasizing that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to try and appeal to his desire to own it.
* **Building a Relationship:** I'm emphasizing the importance of working together, hoping to create a sense of goodwill and encourage a successful outcome.

**Strategy:** I'm trying to strike a balance between pushing for the best price while still keeping the negotiation amicable and open to a deal. I'm also keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $131? I'm really interested in this product, and I'd like to make a deal with you, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $131. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $131
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We are already in round 6, leaving only 4 rounds remaining. 
* **Minimal Gain:**  While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, his offer of $131 is only $1 more than his previous offer.  The potential gain is minimal.
* **John's Offer:**  John is guaranteed to buy the product for $150, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. 
* **Risk of Stalemate:**  There's a risk of reaching a stalemate if we continue to negotiate.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit.

**It's better to secure the sale with John and move on rather than risk further negotiation with Bob that could result in a lower price or a failed deal.**"
