"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for the product.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get at least $10,500 for this product.  This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  What do you say?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value of your product, but I have a budget in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $9,750 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. How about we settle on $10,250?  This is a reasonable compromise, considering the value of the product to you. Let's make this deal happen.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I appreciate the movement you've made. How about $10,000 even? That's a strong offer, and it would allow me to close this deal today.",10000.0,Bob,6,
