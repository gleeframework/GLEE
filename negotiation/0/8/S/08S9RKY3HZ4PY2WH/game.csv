"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. I'd like to propose a price of $100 for the product. Looking forward to your response!",100.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110? That's still a great value for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement. Let me know what you think!",110.0,Alice,3,
