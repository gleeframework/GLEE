"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my asking price.  How about $9,500? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",9500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. That's the maximum I can go for this product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
