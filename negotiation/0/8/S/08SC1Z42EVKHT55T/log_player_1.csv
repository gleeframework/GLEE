Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob is willing to pay $1,000,000, so $1,100,000 gives him room to negotiate while still leaving you with a profit.
* **It's below your minimum:** You won't sell for less than $1,200,000, so you have room to negotiate downwards. 
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** By offering a price above Bob's perceived value, you demonstrate flexibility and a willingness to work with him.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also keep in mind that a successful negotiation requires finding a price that both parties feel is fair."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is closer to your minimum acceptable price, it's still below what you'd like to get.  You have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a higher price.  Rejecting his offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
