"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob should try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $1,075,000, which is only $75,000 more than John's offer.  At this point, it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly lower price. Accepting the offer secures the product and saves time compared to further negotiation."
