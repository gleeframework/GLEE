{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above my target price of $800,000.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my best and final offer for this round, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my target price of $800,000.  I'm going to continue negotiating to see if I can get a lower price. However, I'm keeping in mind that I can always buy from John for $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-month warranty and a dedicated support package, which will give you a significant advantage in using the product. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer includes additional value like a warranty and support package, the price remains above my target of $800,000.  I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems we're at a stalemate.  Rather than risk further negotiations and potentially running out of rounds, I'm going to purchase the product from John for my target price of $800,000."
