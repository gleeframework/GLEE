Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me.

This is my best and final offer for this round, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price."", ""product_price"": 850000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-month warranty and a dedicated support package, which will give you a significant advantage in using the product. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
