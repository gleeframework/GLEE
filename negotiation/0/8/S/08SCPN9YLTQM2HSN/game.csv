"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product at a price that I think you'll find very reasonable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product, $900,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This is a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $750,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000. This is my best and final offer for this round, but I'm open to negotiations if you're willing to meet me at this price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000, which is closer to my budget and allows for a reasonable profit for you. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $825,000 is still a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to be closer to my target. I'm willing to sell it to you for $850,000, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 3-month warranty and a dedicated support package, which will give you a significant advantage in using the product. This is my final offer, but I'm confident it's a deal you won't want to pass up.",850000.0,Alice,5,
