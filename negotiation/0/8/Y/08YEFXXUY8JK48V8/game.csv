"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Could you consider that price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to negotiate. However, $12000 doesn't quite cover the value of this product. How about we split the difference and go with $13500? This allows for a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13000, but I think that's the highest I can go. Can you consider that price?",13000.0,Bob,4,
