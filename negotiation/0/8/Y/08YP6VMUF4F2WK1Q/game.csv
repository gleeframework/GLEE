"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than I'm willing to pay. Given my budget, I can offer $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me and your potential gain.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. This is my final offer before I consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still out of my reach. I can offer $950,000 for the product. This price reflects the value it holds for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,4,
