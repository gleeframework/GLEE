Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $140. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we could start at $150, there's a chance Bob might find that price too high. Offering it slightly lower at $140 increases the likelihood of him accepting and still yields a significant profit.
* **Time Value:**  Knowing John is a guaranteed buyer at $150 provides a safety net. However, a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush.  Getting the deal done quickly with Bob avoids potential delays of waiting for John.
* **Slight Negotiation Room:** The $140 offer leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's particularly price-sensitive, while still keeping Alice well above her minimum."
