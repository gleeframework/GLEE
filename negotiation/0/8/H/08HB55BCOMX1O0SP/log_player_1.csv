"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a good starting point, as it's higher than my minimum but still potentially appealing to Bob.  If he rejects, I can then gauge his interest and adjust my price accordingly in the following rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum desired value of $80.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm offering $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value to me while still potentially being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. Although it's my minimum desired value, it's still a better outcome than selling to John for the same price. There's no guarantee that I'll get a better offer in the remaining rounds, so I'll take the sure thing and close the deal."
