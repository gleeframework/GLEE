"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1200000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm confident this is a price that reflects its worth, but I'm open to hearing your thoughts.  Let's talk.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 seems a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1100000 doesn't quite meet my minimum.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1150000. This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1150000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1050000 for the product. I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1050000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1100000 to close this deal. This price is a fair compromise and gives us both a good outcome.  What do you say? ",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1050000 and $1100000, so I'll offer $975000 for the product. I'm hoping we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,6,
