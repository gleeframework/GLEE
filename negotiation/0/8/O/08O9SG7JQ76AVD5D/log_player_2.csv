"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to revolutionize your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,200,000 is a good deal, it's still above his ideal price point of $1,000,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the potential of this product,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me right now.  I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in this product, and I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit far apart from your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,175,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,175,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to get the price down closer to his ideal price point. Even though Alice is meeting him halfway, $1,175,000 is still above his target. There are more rounds left, so Bob can continue negotiating to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $1,175,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000. This is a fair offer that shows I'm serious about acquiring this product, and I believe we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,150,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down further, she's still at $1,150,000, which is outside of Bob's ideal price range.  With only 5 rounds left, there is a high chance that the negotiations will continue to stall.  Buying the product from John guarantees a price of $1,000,000, which is the best possible outcome for Bob at this point."
