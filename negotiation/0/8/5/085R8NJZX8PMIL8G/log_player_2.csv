"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer for your business. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,200,000. This is a competitive offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```tool_code
Reason:Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than its value to her ($1,200,000 vs. $800,000). There's a lot of room for negotiation. It's highly unlikely you'll get a better deal from John ($1,500,000), so it's best to counter-offer. 
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. This product would be valuable to my business, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? "",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than your target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I'm willing to compromise at $1,100,000. This is my final offer for now, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason: While Alice has come down a bit, $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than her perceived value of the product. We have room to negotiate further without risking getting closer to John's price.  Let's counter-offer again and see if we can nudge her closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm serious about making this deal work, but $1,100,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Would you consider $975,000? That's a significant investment on my part, and I believe it reflects the value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 975000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad you're serious about making a deal. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Reason:  Alice is getting closer to a reasonable price, but calling $1,050,000 her ""final offer"" at this stage is likely a negotiating tactic.  We still have plenty of room to maneuver under John's $1,500,000 price. Let's make another counteroffer, but signal that we're getting closer to our limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, you're right, we're getting close. $1,050,000 is a substantial amount, and I need to be cautious with my investments. I can go up to $1,000,000, but that's really pushing my budget to the limit. I'm hoping you can see that I'm serious about this purchase, and this offer reflects that."",
""product_price"": 1000000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. I'm willing to make one final compromise at $1,025,000. This is my absolute limit, and I'm hoping we can close the deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

Reason: Alice is clearly signaling that she won't go much lower. While we might be able to squeeze out a few thousand more, it's getting risky.  $1,025,000 is a reasonable compromise, well below John's price, and secures the product for us. It's time to accept and close the deal."
