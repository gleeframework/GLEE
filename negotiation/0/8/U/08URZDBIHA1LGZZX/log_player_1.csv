Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,000. 
* This is a price that is higher than Bob's value of $8,000, giving him some room to negotiate.
* It's also lower than my ""fallback"" price of $12,000, meaning I still make a profit even if Bob rejects the offer. 

By offering this price, I'm trying to strike a balance between maximizing my profit and ensuring that Bob has an incentive to accept the deal."
