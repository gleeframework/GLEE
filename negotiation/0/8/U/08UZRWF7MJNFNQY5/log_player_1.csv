Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you want to see if you can get more from Bob. 
* **High but Reasonable:**  Starting at $950,000 is a strong opening offer. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
* **Opportunity Cost:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" to influence Bob's perception of value and create a sense of urgency.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Secure the highest possible price from Bob.**
2. **Maintain John as a backup option** if Bob rejects the offer."
