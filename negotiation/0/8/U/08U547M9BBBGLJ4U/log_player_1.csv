Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $100, but still leaves some room for negotiation and allows Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $110 is better than selling to John, I'm not satisfied with that price. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125} 
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a price that's more than my minimum and closer to my desired profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is only $5 more than John's offer. While it's a bit more profitable, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potential deadlock. I'll sell to John and be done with it."
