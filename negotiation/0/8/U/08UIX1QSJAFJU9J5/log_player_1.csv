Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) but lower than my minimum acceptable price ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This leaves room for negotiation, allowing Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal while still ensuring I make a profit.
* **Friendly Tone:**  I'm using a friendly tone to create a positive atmosphere for negotiation. 

**Note:** This is just the initial offer. I'm prepared to adjust my offer based on Bob's response and the ongoing negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $60? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $60 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150 and even below Bob's own perceived value of $80. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's initial offer is unacceptable, it indicates he's interested in the product.  There's still room for negotiation, and I can try to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Selling to John is an option:**  I'm keeping the option of selling to John for $150 open, which gives me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail. 

**Next Steps:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming to find a price that's fair for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $60 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $100. This still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but not at the expense of my own profit. 
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm emphasizing the value Bob gets at $100, reminding him that it's still significantly lower than what he'd be willing to pay.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm maintaining a positive and open tone to keep the negotiation going.

**Next Steps:**

I'll wait for Bob's response and be prepared to adjust my offer further if necessary. I'm also keeping the option of selling to John open as a fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product, Alice, but I have a budget in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** Bob's offer of $80 represents a significant increase from his previous offer, and it's closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $150, accepting this offer guarantees a sale and avoids the risk of further negotiation. There's no guarantee that Bob will accept a higher counteroffer, and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether.
* **Time is Money:**  Continuing the negotiation might lead to a better price, but it also consumes time. I can always sell to John for $150 if necessary, but this offer provides a reasonable profit with minimal delay. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll accept Bob's offer and finalize the sale."
