The product is worth $80 to me, and Alice is offering it at $130. I can do better than that by negotiating with Alice."

I'm offering Alice $85, which is still below what the product is worth to me, but a significant improvement on her initial offer. This should hopefully start the negotiation process towards a price we can both agree on."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum value of $80. I'll continue to negotiate with Alice and aim for a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

I'm offering Alice $95, which is a compromise between her latest offer and my maximum value. I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on."
