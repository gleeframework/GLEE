Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm offering the product to Bob for $130. This is a price that is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150, but still leaves room for negotiation.  It's also a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value of $80, so there's potential for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm still willing to negotiate, but I believe I can get a better price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm counteroffering Bob at $110. This is a compromise from my previous offer and still leaves room for further negotiation. It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price of $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $150. While Bob's offer of $95 is better than his previous offers, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I believe I can get a better price through further negotiation. However, John is offering my minimum acceptable price, and I don't want to risk further negotiation with Bob potentially ending with a lower price."
