,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to offer $850,000, given its worth to me and the value we can both create from this deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $850,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits of this deal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $950,000.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $950,000 is still a bit outside my budget. Given the value I've placed on this product, I'm willing to go up to $900,000. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's bridge the gap and finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand you're trying to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit below my target. Considering the product's value to you and the potential benefits of this deal, I'm willing to compromise further. I'm counteroffering at $975,000, which is a significant reduction from my initial offer. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's worth.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to compromise.  While $975,000 is closer, I'm still aiming to get the best deal possible for both of us.  Given the value I've placed on the product and my budget, I'm going to offer you $925,000.  This price reflects the product's worth and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",925000.0,Bob,6,
