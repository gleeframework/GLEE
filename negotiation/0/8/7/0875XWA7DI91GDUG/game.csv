"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business, potentially even more than it does for mine. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I see the value in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we start the conversation at $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. While I see the value is closer to your initial offer, I'm still hoping to land somewhere closer to the middle ground. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some common ground.  To be honest, $950,000 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,000,000 even?  This would represent a significant discount from my initial offer, yet still reflect the value of the product.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we're getting close.  I'd be willing to settle this right now for $975,000. That's a fair compromise between our positions.",975000.0,Bob,6,
