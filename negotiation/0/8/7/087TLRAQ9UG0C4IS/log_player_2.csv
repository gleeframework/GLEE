You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Reason: While Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is below her valuation, you know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of getting a better deal from Alice or sticking with your backup option (John)."
