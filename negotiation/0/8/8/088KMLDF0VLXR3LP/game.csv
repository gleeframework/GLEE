"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a bit better for my budget. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $700,000. This is still a great deal considering its value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",700000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $650,000. This is still a great deal, and I believe it's the best compromise we can reach.",650000.0,Alice,5,
