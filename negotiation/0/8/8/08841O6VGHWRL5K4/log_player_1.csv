Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I know it holds even greater value for you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,250,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1100000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $1,100,000 is better than selling to John, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is tempting, it's still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it still represents great value for you.  Let's see if we can bridge the gap!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from comfortable with $1150000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1125000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm still not comfortable with it. I'm going to counter his offer again to try and bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I appreciate your continued interest and flexibility. I'm willing to come down to $1,135,000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. It's a substantial amount for you, and still allows me to achieve a reasonable return. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 1135000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your desire to reach an agreement, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1135000. I'm willing to meet you at $1120000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,120,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my initial goal, Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate and I'm getting close to the point where selling to John might be more appealing.  Accepting $1,120,000 is the best option at this stage."
