"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my minimum asking price and still allows you a good profit margin.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and it still leaves you with a good profit. Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $920,000.  Let's split the difference and settle on $935,000. This is a fair compromise that allows both of us to walk away satisfied.  I'm confident we can finalize this deal.",935000.0,Alice,5,
