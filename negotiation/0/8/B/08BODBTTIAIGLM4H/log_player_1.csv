Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts with a price higher than my minimum, but still potentially attractive to Bob. If he rejects, I can use his counteroffer to adjust my price. It's a good starting point to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $95 is better than selling to John, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate, $95 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $105? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $100? That seems like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is the same as what John would pay.  Since I'm aiming for the highest price possible, I'll accept Bob's offer. This ensures I get the best deal without risking further negotiation that could result in a lower price."
