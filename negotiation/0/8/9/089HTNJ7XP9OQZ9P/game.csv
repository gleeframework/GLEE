"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to work with me.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with $12,000. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a profit. I can do $13,500. This is my final offer, but I'm open to negotiations.",13500.0,Alice,5,
