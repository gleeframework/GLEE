"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be highly valuable to you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,500,000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd like to offer $1,000,000.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest and counteroffer. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is truly significant, and $1,000,000 is quite a distance from what I had in mind.  Could you consider $1,350,000?  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,350,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and allow me to move forward with the purchase. ",1200000.0,Bob,4,
