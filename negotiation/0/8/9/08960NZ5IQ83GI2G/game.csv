"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,125,000. This is a fair price, considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While I see the value in the product, $1,125,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $1,100,000? That's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
