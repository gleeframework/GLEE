"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me to consider. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $1,100,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,100,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's the best chance for us to come to an agreement.  Let me know what you think.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still far below the product's true value.  While I'm open to finding a compromise, I need to be closer to my asking price.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $1,000,000.  This offer is fair and reflects the value of the product while being within your budget. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit out of my reach. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This is a good middle ground, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's try to find a solution.",975000.0,Bob,6,
