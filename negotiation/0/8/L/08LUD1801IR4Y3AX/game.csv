"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit,  how about $1,350,000?  That leaves room for both of us to make a good deal. ",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down from $1,400,000 to $1,350,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. Can you consider that?",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $1,300,000 is still not quite where I need to be.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to sell for $1,325,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product holds for you.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I really think $1,325,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,280,000. That's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",1280000.0,Bob,6,
