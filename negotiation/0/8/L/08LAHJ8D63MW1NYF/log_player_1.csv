Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $10,500, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000 by continuing the negotiation."

Bob's offer:

I'll accept Bob's offer of $11,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's getting closer to what I need and it's likely I won't get a better offer from him.  It's better to close the deal now than to risk losing him completely."
