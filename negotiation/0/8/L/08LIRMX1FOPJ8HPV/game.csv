"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you would be very interested in. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as I know you value it highly and I'm confident I can find another buyer for $12,000 if you decline. Let me know what you think!",12500.0,Alice,1,
