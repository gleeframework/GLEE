"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $9,000. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high.  I can offer $8,500.  That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm hoping you'll consider it.",8500.0,Bob,4,
