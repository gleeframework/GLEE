"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by aiming high, but still within a range where Bob might be willing to pay. This sets the stage for potential counteroffers and leaves room for both of us to find a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $9,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $7,500 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I have 8 rounds left, so I can continue negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $8,500 is still a little high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $8,250.  Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $8,250 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $8,000, and I'm happy to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
