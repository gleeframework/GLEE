"Thanks for the offer, Alice. That's a bit steep for me right now.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $60 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice.  $90 is still a bit high for my budget. How about $75? That's a pretty good compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still not quite there. Let's try $85.  I'm really hoping to make this deal work, and I think this price is fair considering the value of the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
