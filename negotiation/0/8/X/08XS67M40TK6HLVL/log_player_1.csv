""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer matches John's price, it's still early in the negotiation. I want to see if I can secure a higher price from Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your understanding of the value this product brings. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,200,000 is below my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This reflects the product's true potential while offering you a significant discount from my initial offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's my limit. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is slowly moving towards my desired price point. While John's offer is becoming more appealing, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Bob. I'm willing to hold out a little longer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm committed to finding a price that works for both of us.  To that end, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,325,000.  This represents a significant investment on your part, but I'm confident the value you'll receive will far exceed the price."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, but that's my final offer. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob has steadily increased his offer, and at $1,275,000, it's getting close enough to my acceptable range.  While I might be able to squeeze out a little more, the risk of him walking away and the diminishing returns suggest it's a good time to accept and close the deal."
