Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to bring the price down, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can see you're serious about the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $975,000. I'll meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,050,000, which is $1,012,500. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll see the value in this price.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You'll be buying the product for $1,012,500, saving you $187,500 compared to John's offer. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Further haggling is unlikely to yield significant savings. Alice has indicated this is her final offer, and she's already moved closer to your price.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Pushing further could make Alice walk away, forcing you to buy from John at a higher price."
