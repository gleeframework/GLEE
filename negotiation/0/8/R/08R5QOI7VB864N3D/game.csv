"Alice, that's a great product, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
