Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a great product, but the price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This price reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of this product, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,175,000? This feels like a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,175,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's still below my minimum acceptable price, and further negotiation is unlikely to close the gap significantly.  I'd rather take John's guaranteed offer of $1,200,000."
