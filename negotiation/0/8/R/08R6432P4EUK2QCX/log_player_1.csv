"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 
I'm not going to accept Bob's lowball offer, but I'm also not ready to sell to John yet. I'll see if I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $16,000 is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $13,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not willing to accept Bob's offer.  $13,500 is too far below my minimum, but I'm not ready to give up on a higher price just yet. I'll make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to continue negotiating with you, but I need to be closer to my asking price.  How about $15,500? That's a significant drop from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 15500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down further on the price. However, $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $14,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000

We've reached a point where the negotiations with Bob are taking too long, and I'm getting closer to my minimum acceptable price. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for $15,000."
