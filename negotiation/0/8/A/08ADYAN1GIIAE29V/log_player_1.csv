"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed. 
* I'm being positive and encouraging in my message to create a good impression and increase the likelihood of Bob accepting my offer.
* This is my first offer and I want to gauge Bob's interest. If he rejects it, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of your product, but I'm only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is at my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price yet.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm keeping the negotiations moving forward by rejecting Bob's offer but immediately making a counteroffer.
* I'm only coming down $500 from my original asking price.  This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I believe the product is worth more. 
* My message is still positive and encouraging to keep the relationship with Bob amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your price, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $8,200 for your product. I hope this helps us reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $8,200 is only $200 below my minimum acceptable price.  Given that we're already on round 4 and there are only 6 rounds left, I'm going to accept his offer to avoid the risk of further negotiation.  It's better to secure a sale now than risk losing a deal altogether."
