"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product. However, $1,100,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000. This price would be a good compromise and allows both of us to come out ahead. ",975000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not ready to meet you at $975,000 just yet. I'll take another step closer to your offer, and I'll sell the product to you for $1,000,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $985,000, but I'd like to add a small premium for the product's exclusivity. I'll sell it to you for $1,015,000. Let's see if we can finalize the deal at this price.",1015000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your desire for a premium, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,015,000. I'm willing to go up to $995,000 to finalize this deal. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal quickly.",995000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your continued effort, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $995,000, but I'd like to make one final push for a higher price. I'll sell it to you for $1,050,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
