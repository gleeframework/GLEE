"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $14,000.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $16,500. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit higher than I can afford.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $15,000.  If you're not willing to go that low, I'll have to go with John's offer.",15000.0,Bob,4,
