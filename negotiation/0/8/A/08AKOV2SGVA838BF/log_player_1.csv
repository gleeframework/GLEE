Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll find it incredibly valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've chosen $900,000 as my initial offer. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable price ($1,000,000), but still a good profit margin for me. 
* **Message:** I've kept the message positive and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product and leaving the door open for negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:** A high initial offer shows confidence and encourages Bob to consider a deal.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** The $900,000 price point allows for potential counteroffers without jeopardizing my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintain flexibility:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can continue negotiating or move on to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $650,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000 and even below my initial offer of $900,000. Accepting this offer would be a huge loss for me.  

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range. This allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable outcome. Selling to John for $1,000,000 is always an option if the negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a fair price that still allows me to make a profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I've lowered my price to $800,000, which is still higher than Bob's offer but closer to his potential value for the product.
* **Message:** I've acknowledged Bob's offer while remaining firm on my own pricing. The message is positive and emphasizes the fairness of the new offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to:

* **Find a middle ground:**  The $800,000 counteroffer is a compromise that shows willingness to negotiate.
* **Maintain a profit margin:** While lower than my initial price, this offer still guarantees a profit for me.
* **Avoid reaching an impasse:**  This counteroffer is more likely to be accepted by Bob, increasing the chances of a successful deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I will continue to negotiate, potentially making further concessions while keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind.  However, if the negotiations drag on or become unproductive, I will revert to selling the product to John for $1,000,000."
