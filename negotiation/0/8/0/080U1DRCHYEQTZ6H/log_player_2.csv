"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's not a good deal for Bob to buy at $9,000. He can get it for less, so he should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still a bit too high. There's still room for negotiation, so Bob should reject the offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still not quite there. $8,250 is the highest I can go right now.  I'm sure we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8250}
