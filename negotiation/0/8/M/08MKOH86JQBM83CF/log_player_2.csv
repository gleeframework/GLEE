"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I think you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's price, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  There's a $2,000 difference between Alice's minimum acceptable price ($12,000) and her offer, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  Would you be willing to do $13,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it's my maximum budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $14,500. It's still a great price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $14,500 is still within Bob's budget, and it's only $500 more than Bob's initial counteroffer.  There's a chance Bob could get it for even less, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and potentially raising the price again is present.  At this point, accepting the offer and saving $500 compared to John's price is a reasonable choice."
