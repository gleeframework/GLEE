"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's initial offer is tempting, Bob can potentially do better. Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to its value to me.  I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds for me, while also allowing for a profitable margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to secure the product at a lower price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's within his budget, and it's a significant reduction from her initial offer of $1,100,000. While Bob could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will reject his counteroffer, potentially leading to a higher price or even breaking off the negotiations entirely. 

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of a more expensive alternative."
