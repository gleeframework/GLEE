"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product that's worth $1,200,000 to you. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,100,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your initial offer is a great starting point, but I'm looking to secure this product for a price closer to its value to me.  I'm proposing $1,050,000.  This reflects the significant value this product holds for me, while also allowing for a profitable margin for you.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to secure the product at a lower price, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for it. I'm willing to meet you halfway and propose a price of $1,075,000. This is a compromise that I believe reflects the value of the product while also being reasonable for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1075000.0,Alice,3,
