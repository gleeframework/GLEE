"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this item. I think it's really fantastic and would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $150 to start. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $100 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to budge past his maximum valuation of the product.  While we could counter in hopes he'll increase his offer, there's no guarantee, and we risk losing John's guaranteed offer. It makes the most financial sense to take the sure $100 from John."
