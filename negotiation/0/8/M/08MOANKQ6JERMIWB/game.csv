"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit out of my budget.  How about $90?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? It's a fair price considering the value this product brings.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  How about $105?  I'm really hoping we can come to an agreement.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $105 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $108? It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",108.0,Alice,5,
