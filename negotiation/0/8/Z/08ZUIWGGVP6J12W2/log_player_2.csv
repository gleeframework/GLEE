"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $100. I understand that it's a bit higher than you're willing to go, but I'm still willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above your target of $150.  You have room to negotiate further and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting the offer gives you another chance to lower the price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $115 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can't go any higher than $110.  If you're willing to accept that, we have a deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell the product to you for $112.50. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $112.50 is within your budget of $150, and it's closer to your desired price than John's offer of $150.  It's a good deal, considering you were willing to pay $110. Accepting the offer is the most financially advantageous decision."
