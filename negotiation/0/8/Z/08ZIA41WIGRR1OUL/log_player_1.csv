Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $9,500 is better than nothing, I believe I can get closer to my minimum asking price of $10,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While I understand your offer,  $9,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $10,500? This is still a good deal for you, considering the value you place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $10500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9800. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $10,000, $9,800 is a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the limited rounds remaining. Selling to John would only yield $10,000, and I'm not sure I can negotiate a better offer with Bob in the remaining rounds."
