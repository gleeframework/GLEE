"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $1200000.

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand that you're trying to get closer to the true value of the product to me. However, I'm still not comfortable with $950000.
