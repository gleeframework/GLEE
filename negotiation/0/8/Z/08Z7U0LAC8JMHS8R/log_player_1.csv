"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, to see if he's willing to pay a premium. I'm leaving some room for negotiation but still aiming for a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I can still do better. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I believe I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
```

I'm making a counteroffer of $135. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer, but still allowing me a good profit. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer to avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, Bob's offer of $132 is still a good profit for me. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small gains, and it's better to secure this deal than risk losing him altogether or having to settle for John's offer of $100."
