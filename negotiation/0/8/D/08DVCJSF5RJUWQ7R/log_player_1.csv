Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price by continuing to negotiate."

``` 

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $1,550,000 is a good deal considering Bob's budget constraints. It's also better than selling to John for $1,500,000."
