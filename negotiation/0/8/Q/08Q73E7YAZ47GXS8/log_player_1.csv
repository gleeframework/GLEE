Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your confidence in the product's value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the initial offer of $1,300,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,000,000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for considering my position. I truly value the product, but my budget constraints remain firm. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,160,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching a satisfactory agreement.

}
``` 

While holding out for a higher offer is tempting, Bob is steadily increasing his offer and we are already above $1,150,000. Accepting at $1,160,000 secures a significant profit above our minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further lowballing in later rounds."
