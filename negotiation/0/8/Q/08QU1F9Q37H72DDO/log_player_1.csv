"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting high with $1,000,000. This is a strong opening offer that sets a high baseline. It's likely Bob will counter, but I want to see how interested he truly is and if he's willing to play in this price range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $900,000 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm countering with $950,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer and shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to my initial ask."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While $925,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I believe I can still push for a little more. We're in the late stages of the negotiation, and I want to maximize my earnings. I'm still hopeful that Bob will come up to a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

I'm countering again with $940,000.  This is a compromise, showing flexibility while still aiming for a price closer to my target.  I'm hoping that Bob sees that I'm serious about getting a deal done and will come up slightly to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $930,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $930,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $930,000. We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I would have preferred a higher price, $930,000 is a good outcome. It's significantly higher than John's offer and ensures a successful sale. I'm willing to compromise a little to secure the deal with Bob."
