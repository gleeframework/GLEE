"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to meet you partway while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $2,050,000. Can you consider this offer?",2050000.0,Bob,4,
