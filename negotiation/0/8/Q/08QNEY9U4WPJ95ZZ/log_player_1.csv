"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a high price ($2,300,000) sets a strong anchor. Even if this price is rejected, it gives us significant room to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a final price well above our minimum ($1,500,000). 
* **Confidence:**  The message projects confidence in the product's value, which can influence Bob's perception.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains open to negotiation, inviting Bob to engage in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is a significant increase from his perceived value, it's still below our target range. We have plenty of room for negotiation and rounds left.  Rejecting now signals that we believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your perspective, Bob. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,800,000 undervalues its potential.  I could consider a price of $2,100,000. This reflects a willingness to meet you partway while still acknowledging the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** We're lowering our price by $200,000 but justifying it by emphasizing the product's value. This shows flexibility while reinforcing our position.
* **Meeting Halfway (Approximately):** The new price is closer to the midpoint between Bob's offer and our previous ask, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Language:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $1,800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $2,050,000. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Offer:** $2,050,000 is a strong offer. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value and a good return for us.
* **Momentum Shift:** Bob is now the one suggesting meeting ""halfway."" This could indicate he's reaching his upper limit. 
* **Time Value:**  While we have rounds remaining, securing a deal now avoids potential for further negotiation or Bob walking away. 

Overall, accepting $2,050,000 balances risk and reward favorably at this stage."
