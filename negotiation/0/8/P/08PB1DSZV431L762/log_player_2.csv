{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $100?  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling $115 is a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
