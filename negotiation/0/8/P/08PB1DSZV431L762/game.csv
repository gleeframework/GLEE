,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm really interested in the product, though. How about $100?  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $130?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your offer, but $130 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm feeling $115 is a fair price.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $115 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125? This would be a good price for both of us and allow us to finalize the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're still a bit higher than I'd like.  Let's split the difference and close this out at $120.  That would be a great deal for both of us.",120.0,Bob,6,
