"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. While it seems like a good product, $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is too low for me.  This product is worth a lot to the right buyer.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?",120.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand the product has value, but I'm on a bit of a budget.  Could you do $90?  That's a fair compromise, I think.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to get at least $100 for this.  That's my absolute bottom line. Take it or leave it.",100.0,Alice,5,
