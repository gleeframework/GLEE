Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $10,000, aiming for a higher price with Bob first allows us to potentially maximize profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $9,500 is a strong starting point. It's considerably lower than its value to you ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Value Proposition:** The message highlights the product's value, subtly encouraging Bob to consider the potential benefits even though it's slightly above his perceived value. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can adjust her strategy in further negotiations."
