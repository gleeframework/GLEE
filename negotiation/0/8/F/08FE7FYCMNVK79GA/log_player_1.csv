Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for $22,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond its price."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and creates the impression that the product might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm planting a seed of doubt in Bob's mind and prompting him to consider potential benefits he might not have factored in. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum. While it's a step closer, I have room to negotiate. I'll counter with an offer closer to my bottom line but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is significantly below its value. I could meet you halfway at $17,000."", ""product_price"": 17000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway (Seemingly):** This creates an illusion of compromise and fairness, potentially making Bob more receptive. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer is still comfortably above my $15,000 minimum and leaves a small margin for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $14,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob's offer of $14,000 is now above my absolute minimum of $15,000. Accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or further protracted negotiations."
