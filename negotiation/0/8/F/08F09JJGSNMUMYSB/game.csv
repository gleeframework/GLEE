"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,500? It's still a great value for you, and it allows me to cover some of my costs. Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. How about $9,500? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is still not quite meeting my needs. I'm willing to come down a little more, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price. How about $10,000? This offer is closer to your target price while still allowing me to recoup some of my costs. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit far from my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. How about $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $9,000 simply doesn't work for me. I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  I'm willing to drop to $9,750.  This is a good compromise for both of us, allowing you to get a good deal and me to get a reasonable price. Let me know what you think.",9750.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still looking to get as close to my target price as possible. How about $9,200? I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9200.0,Bob,8,
