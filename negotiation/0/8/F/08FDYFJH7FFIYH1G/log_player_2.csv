It's always worth exploring negotiation before committing to a price.  $999,000 is a good starting point, but there's room to potentially get a better deal."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price.  This will give us room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that works for both of us."

While $950,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still more than I'd like to pay. I'll counter again to try to get closer to my target price."

I'm increasing my counteroffer slightly, but still trying to stay under $950,000. Hopefully, this will be closer to a price Alice is willing to accept."

Alice is coming down in price, but I'm still hoping to get it a bit lower. I'll counter again to try and close the gap."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 930000}

I'm going to try one more time to see if we can meet in the middle. I'm increasing my offer slightly, but I'm still hoping to save some money."

Alice is getting closer to my target price, and we're running out of rounds.  While I'd prefer to pay less, $935,000 is a good deal compared to buying from John."
