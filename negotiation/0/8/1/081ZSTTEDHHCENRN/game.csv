"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better offer anywhere else.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a compromise that I think you'll find reasonable.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $975,000? That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, $975,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll offer it to you for $1,025,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your patience.  I can tell we're getting close to an agreeable price. How about $1,000,000?  That's a fair offer and I think it's a good deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept from John, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum, so I'll offer it to you for $1,005,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1005000.0,Alice,7,
