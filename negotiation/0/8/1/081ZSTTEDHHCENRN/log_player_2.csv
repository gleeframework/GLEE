Round 3

Round 5

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I've already mentioned that $1,000,000 is the minimum I'm willing to accept from John, and I'm not sure I want to go any lower. I'll give you one last chance to meet me at my minimum, so I'll offer it to you for $1,005,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,005,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,005,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

This is a good point to accept the offer.  Here's why:

* **Alice is firm:** She has repeatedly stated that $1,000,000 is her absolute minimum. Her latest offer is just slightly above that, signaling she's unlikely to budge further.
* **Time is running out:** You have only a few rounds left, and continuing to negotiate might irritate Alice and risk losing the deal.
* **Savings are significant:**  You're already saving $195,000 compared to John's price. Pushing for a slightly lower price isn't worth the risk of losing the deal altogether."
