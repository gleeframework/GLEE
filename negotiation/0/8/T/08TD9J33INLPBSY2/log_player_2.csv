**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. By rejecting this offer, you put yourself in a position to get a better deal. Alice might counter-offer with a lower price, or you can proceed to buy from John for $8,000."
