"Alice, $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $85.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that 120 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try 100? It's a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $100 is still a bit high for me. I'm really looking for a price closer to $85. How about we meet at $90?",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go all the way down to 90. How about we meet at 95? It's a small compromise from my original offer, but still reflects the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,5,
