Send your offer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair.  What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value, but I believe the product's unique qualities warrant a higher price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,300,000?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Reasoning:** Bob is steadily decreasing his offer.  It's unlikely he'll significantly increase it in the remaining rounds. Accepting his current offer would be a significant loss compared to John's guaranteed offer.  It's time to cut losses and secure a sure sale with John."
