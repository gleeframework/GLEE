Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit above your minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $1,150,000 is still significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) but leaves room for him to feel like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other buyers creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly. 
* **""Exclusive Opportunity""**:  Framing the offer as exclusive adds perceived value.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price.  You'll need to decide if you're willing to go lower or if you'd rather move on to John, your guaranteed sale."
