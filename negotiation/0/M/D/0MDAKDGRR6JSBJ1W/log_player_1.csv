"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a substantial profit.  This price leaves room for negotiation, but still reflects the value I place on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is a decent profit, I believe I can do better.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show I'm willing to compromise, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit.  This price is a good midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me and likely a fair price for Bob.  I'll take it!"
