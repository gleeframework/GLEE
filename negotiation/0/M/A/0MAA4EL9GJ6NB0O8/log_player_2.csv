"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is better than John's price, it's still above Bob's maximum value. He has room to negotiate and should try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a moderate counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to his maximum value while still leaving room for further negotiation. This approach shows a willingness to compromise while demonstrating Bob's commitment to getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,500 is a fair price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250.  Let's try to make this work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still above what he wants to pay.  He's still willing to negotiate, hoping to get a lower price. It's worth seeing if he can get closer to his target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit too much for me. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a fair price considering my budget and your minimum. I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to negotiate, but this time he's only lowered the price by a small amount.  This shows Alice that he's serious about getting a deal but also understands that she needs to make a profit.  He's hoping that Alice will accept this offer, as it's close to her minimum and still within Bob's budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $13,100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has been negotiating for a few rounds, and while Alice is willing to compromise, the price is still above his maximum value.  He's already spent several rounds trying to get a better price, and there's no guarantee he can get any lower. At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John for $12,000, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price and saves time and effort on further negotiations."
