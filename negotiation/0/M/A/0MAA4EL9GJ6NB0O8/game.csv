"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $12,000 to you. Let's see if we can make this happen! ",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500, which is a fair price considering my maximum budget. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $12,500 is a fair price, it's still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $13,250.  Let's try to make this work.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $13,250 is still a bit too much for me. How about we settle on $13,000? It's a fair price considering my budget and your minimum. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $13,000 is still a bit below my minimum.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  How about $13,100? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",13100.0,Alice,5,
