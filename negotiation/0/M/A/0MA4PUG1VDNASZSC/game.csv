"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can make this work.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $13,250? Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me.  How about $13,000?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $13,100, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",13100.0,Alice,5,
