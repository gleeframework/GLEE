Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm willing to come down to $13,100, but that's my final offer. If you're not interested, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.

Bob should choose to buy the product from John.  Alice is not budging much further, and he's already at a point where he can get the product for $12,000 from another seller.  There's no point in continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point."
