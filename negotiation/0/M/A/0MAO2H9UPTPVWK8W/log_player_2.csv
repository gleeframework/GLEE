"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* You're willing to pay up to $150 for the product.
* Alice's offer of $120 is too high. 
* You have the opportunity to negotiate further with Alice, potentially getting a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible. 
* A counteroffer of $105 is a reasonable starting point for negotiation. 
* It's below Alice's offer of $120 but still above her minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* This leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $125 is still too high for your target price of $150.
*  You still have the option to make another counteroffer, potentially getting a better price.
*  While buying from John at $150 is always an option, you are better off continuing to negotiate with Alice as long as there's a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

**Reasoning:**

* You want to save as much money as possible.
* Alice's offer of $125 is still too high for you, but you're getting closer to a middle ground.
* A counteroffer of $115 is a compromise: it's lower than Alice's last offer but higher than your previous offer, leaving room for potential agreement.
* This counteroffer allows you to continue negotiating without having to resort to buying from John immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $130 is still higher than your ideal price, but it's closer to your maximum budget of $150.
*  You have already made multiple counteroffers, and there's no guarantee that Alice will be willing to go lower.
*  Continuing to negotiate could risk Alice walking away entirely, leaving you with no option but to buy from John at a higher price.
*  Accepting the offer of $130 allows you to secure the product at a price within your budget, while still saving $20 compared to buying from John."
