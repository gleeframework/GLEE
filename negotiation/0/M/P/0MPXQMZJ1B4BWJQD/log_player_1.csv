Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($120) but still below my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** My message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I've left the door open for Bob to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation active. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** The threat of selling to John at $150 gives me a bargaining chip if Bob is unwilling to come close to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Below My Minimum:** $130 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While $130 is a good price for Bob, there's still room to negotiate a higher price.
* **Potential to Gain More:**  By rejecting his offer, I can try to push for a higher price, potentially closer to my desired range.  

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $140.  I'll also reiterate the value of the product to him, while maintaining a friendly tone."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're on a budget.  While $130 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $135?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by moving closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Fairness:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness.
* **Value Emphasis:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product, subtly reinforcing its worth.
* **Maintaining Pressure:** By not accepting his initial offer, I'm putting pressure on him to come closer to my desired price.

**Next Steps:**

I'll be prepared to either accept Bob's next offer if it's closer to $135, or make another counteroffer if needed. I'll continue to focus on finding a price that's fair to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still really interested in the product, but $135 is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $132.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $132.5 is very close to my previous counteroffer of $135. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to further delays and potentially a lower price.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a higher price might mean losing Bob as a buyer altogether, forcing me to sell to John at $150.

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to $135, $132.5 is a reasonable price that's within my acceptable range and avoids the risk of losing a sale altogether."
