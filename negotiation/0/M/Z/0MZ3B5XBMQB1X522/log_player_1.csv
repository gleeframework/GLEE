Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $14,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,500.  Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,500 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,250? I'm confident this price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $13,000 is a good price, especially considering the possibility of further negotiation being less favorable. It's also significantly better than selling to John for $12,000."
