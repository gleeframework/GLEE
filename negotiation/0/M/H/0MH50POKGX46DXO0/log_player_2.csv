Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}

I'm offering $7,500, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and still within my budget. This should give Alice some room to negotiate while also demonstrating that I'm serious about getting a good deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still not willing to pay $8,600. I'll keep negotiating and see if I can get closer to my budget of $8,000. With 5 rounds left, I have time to try and get a better deal."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is very close to my budget, it's still higher than what I would like to pay. I'm willing to risk it and continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8300} 
```

I'm offering $8,300, which is just slightly lower than Alice's last offer.  This shows that I'm willing to meet her halfway, but still trying to get a slightly better deal. With only two rounds left, I'm pushing to get as close to my budget as possible."

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

It's getting late in the negotiation, and Alice's offer is still above my budget. While I could try one more counteroffer, there's no guarantee she will accept it. It's safer to buy the product from John for $8,000 to ensure I get the product within my budget."
