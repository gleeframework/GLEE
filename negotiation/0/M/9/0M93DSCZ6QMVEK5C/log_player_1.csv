Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm asking for $20,000. It's a unique item, and I'm confident it will meet your needs perfectly. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $20,000, we can gauge Bob's interest. If he accepts immediately, we know we could have potentially gone higher. If he rejects it, we can always negotiate down, knowing we have John as a backup buyer at $15,000. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. It's crucial to be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price to reach an agreement that benefits both parties."
