Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a sample offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):**  You have a strong BATNA because you have John willing to pay $1,200,000. This is your safety net.
* **Bob's Perspective:** Bob values the product at $800,000. He'll only accept an offer at or below that price.
* **Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** The ZOPA exists between $800,000 (Bob's maximum) and $1,200,000 (your minimum and John's offer).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, knowing you have John as a backup. However, being too aggressive might make Bob walk away immediately.

**Offer to Bob**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers.  I'm open to discussing this further if you have any thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Opening:** The offer is significantly above Bob's valuation, giving you room to negotiate.
* **Value-Based Language:** The message emphasizes ""unique value"" and ""significant benefits"" to justify the high price. 
* **Openness to Discussion:** The tone remains collaborative, encouraging Bob to counter-offer and engage in negotiation.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening move. Be prepared to:

* **Receive a Counter-Offer:**  Bob will likely counter with a lower price.
* **Negotiate:**  Be willing to come down slightly, but hold firm closer to your $1,200,000 minimum. 
* **Walk Away if Necessary:**  If Bob won't budge above $800,000, you're better off selling to John."
