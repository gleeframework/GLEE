{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $900,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for your business.  Let's discuss!"", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'll try to negotiate a higher price with Bob, as it's still worth more to him than selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you and ensures I get a price closer to the product's true value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $750,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I believe Bob values the product enough to go higher, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference again and go with $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it ensures I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 800000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet John's price of $800,000, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. I'm not trying to lowball you, but I do need to make a business decision. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting my minimum price, and it's better than selling to John. I'm also avoiding further rounds of negotiation, which could lead to a lower price or a deadlock."
