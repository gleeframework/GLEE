"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  I believe its value to you is significant, and I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  My initial offer is $900,000. This reflects the product's unique qualities and potential for your business.  Let's discuss!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me. While I'm open to negotiating, I need to ensure I receive a fair price for this unique product.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves room for a good profit for you and ensures I get a price closer to the product's true value. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $750,000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference again and go with $800,000? This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product, and it ensures I get a reasonable return on my investment.  Let's make this happen!",800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm afraid I'm at my limit. I'm willing to meet John's price of $800,000, but I think this is a fair price for both of us. I'm not trying to lowball you, but I do need to make a business decision.",800000.0,Bob,6,
