Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $8,000 for it. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I still believe $8,000 would be a fair price for this product. Could we please stick to that?

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob seems firm on $8,000. Accepting his offer avoids further negotiation and secures the same amount I'd get from John."
