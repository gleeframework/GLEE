"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?

``` 

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first.  While $1,150,000 is a good price, it's still above Alice's value. There's room for both of us to benefit."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is too low. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

$1,100,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to negotiate a bit more before I consider buying from John."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still not quite enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000

It's getting close to John's price. Alice is getting closer to my desired price. It's in my best interest to accept the offer now."
