"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,050,000 is too low. Let's split the difference - I'm offering the product for $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,075,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,075,000 is still not quite enough.  I'm willing to come down to $1,090,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's in both our best interests to reach an agreement.  Let's make this happen.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
