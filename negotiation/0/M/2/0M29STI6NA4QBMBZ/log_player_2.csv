"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value to you, I propose a price of $10,000. This offer is exclusive to you and represents an exceptional opportunity to acquire this high-quality item at a competitive rate. I look forward to your consideration. If you have any questions or need more information, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or be prepared to buy from John. There's a chance to save $2,000 by not immediately accepting."
