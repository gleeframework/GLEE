"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,500 is a bit lower than I'd hoped, I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This price still allows me to make a fair profit, and I believe it's a great value for a product like this.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make an offer of $8,750. Can you meet me at this price?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $8,750 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but only to $9,250. This would be a final offer from me. If you're not able to meet this price, I will be selling to another buyer.  What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
