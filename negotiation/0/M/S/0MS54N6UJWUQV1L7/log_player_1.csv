Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

``` 

While Bob's offer is still significantly lower than what Alice values the product at, it's not completely unreasonable.  Alice should reject this offer and see if she can push for a higher price.  She still has a strong position as John is willing to pay her full asking price."

Alice should reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to her desired price, she can still do better. John is willing to pay her $10,000, and there's a good chance she can get a price closer to that if she continues negotiating with Bob."
