# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,100,000. It's a unique and highly sought-after item, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000 and saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John.  It's a good deal for you."
