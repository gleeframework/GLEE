Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my previous offer and your latest one. My counteroffer is $10,500. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is very slowly coming down in price.  At this rate, it's unlikely the negotiations will result in a price significantly better than John's offer of $10,000. It's time to cut your losses and go with the guaranteed good deal."
