"That's a bit high for me. I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. I can meet you halfway at $13,000. Would you be interested in that price?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me. How about $10,000?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad you're willing to negotiate further. However, $10,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to accept. I can offer you a compromise at $14,000. It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum, and I think you'll find it's a good deal.",14000.0,Alice,5,
