"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point because it's a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $800,000, but it leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate as the product is worth $1,200,000 to him, and this price is still within his budget.  

This strategy aims to get the highest possible price while keeping the negotiation open for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not as high as I'd like. I have 8 more rounds and the potential to get a better deal. I believe I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $1,200,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer by $50,000 from Bob's previous offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a price closer to my desired value. It also leaves room for further negotiation in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my ideal price, I still believe there's room to push for a higher price.  With 6 rounds left, I'm not willing to settle for a price significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,000,000. I think I can continue to negotiate and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 940000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer again, this time to $940,000. This is a compromise from my previous counteroffer and a slight increase from Bob's last offer.  This demonstrates flexibility while also showing that I'm not willing to drastically reduce my price. The goal is to find a middle ground and close the deal within the remaining rounds."
