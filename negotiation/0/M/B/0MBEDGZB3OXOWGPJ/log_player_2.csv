"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for less than $1,000,000, since Alice values it at $800,000. There's room for negotiation. It's worth trying to get a better price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation and avoids being seen as too aggressive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  While $950,000 is closer to your desired price, you can likely still get a better deal. It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than your previous offer, showing Alice that you're serious about buying the product, but still lower than Alice's current offer, signaling that you're willing to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $940,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $940,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate down to $940,000. At this point, you have to decide if you're willing to risk further rounds of negotiation. You're only $60,000 away from your ideal price point. There's always a chance Alice could come down further, but there's also a chance she could walk away or you might run out of rounds.  It's a risk vs. reward situation.

**Here's why accepting is a good decision:**

* **You're close to your ideal price:**  $940,000 is within your acceptable range and much lower than John's offer.
* **You're likely to save time:**  Further negotiation might not yield a significantly better price, and you're already halfway through your rounds.
* **You could lose the opportunity:**  Alice could change her mind, or another buyer might appear.  

While it's tempting to keep negotiating, the risk of losing a good deal outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
