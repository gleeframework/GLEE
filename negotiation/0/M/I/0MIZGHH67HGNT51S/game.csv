"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $600,000.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $600,000 is quite a gap from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $950,000?  This offer reflects my understanding of the product's true value.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. Would you consider $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to find a fair price, and I respect that. While $775,000 is closer to where I'd be willing to negotiate, it's still a significant gap from my perspective. How about we try $875,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while recognizing the value of this product.",875000.0,Alice,5,
