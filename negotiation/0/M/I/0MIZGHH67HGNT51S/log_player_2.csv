Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product.  $600,000 is quite a gap from my initial asking price. To find a middle ground, how about we consider $950,000?  This offer reflects my understanding of the product's true value.

How about we try $875,000?  This demonstrates my willingness to compromise while recognizing the value of this product.

Alice is unlikely to come down significantly from her current price. It's better to secure the product from John at your target price of $800,000 rather than risk Alice not budging further."
