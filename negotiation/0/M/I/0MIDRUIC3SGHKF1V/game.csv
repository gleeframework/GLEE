"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still not willing to sell it for that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a high-quality product at a competitive price.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While I agree it's a good product, $850,000 is still a little steep for me. Could you do $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget. However, I'm not willing to go down to $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers and offer it to you for $825,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
