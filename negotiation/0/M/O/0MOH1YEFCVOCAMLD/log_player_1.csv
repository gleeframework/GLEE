"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my minimum asking price of $120. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $107.50 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round, aiming to push towards my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to compromise, $107.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $112.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 112.5}
