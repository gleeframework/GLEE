"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $115.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay.  I'm happy to pay $105 for the product. Let's see if we can agree on that.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $105 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll be happy with the product. Let's close this deal!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest and your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm open to compromise, $107.50 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's try $112.50. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a win-win for both of us.  Let me know what you think!",112.5,Alice,5,
