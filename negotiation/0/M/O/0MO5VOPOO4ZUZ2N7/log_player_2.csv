It's far too expensive at $18,000.  Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:

While $14,000 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his target price."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still over his budget.  There's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower price, so Bob should continue negotiating. He might be able to get a better deal, or he might want to explore buying from John if the negotiation stalls."
