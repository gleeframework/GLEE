(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

You want to save money, and $90 is more than your maximum price.  It's best to try and negotiate with Alice."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested but $90 is a bit out of my price range.  How about $75? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest! $75 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $85. Let's meet in the middle, how does that sound? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You are trying to get the product for as cheap as possible.  While $85 is getting closer to your maximum, you can still try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $85 is still a bit too high for me. Let's try $80. That's my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 80}
