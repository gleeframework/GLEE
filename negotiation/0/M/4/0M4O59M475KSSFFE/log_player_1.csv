Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to counteroffer. It also acknowledges the value of the product to him, which might make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. However, I can only pay $90 for the product. Let me know if this works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is more than selling to John, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100 by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $95? This would still be a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target."", ""product_price"": 95}
