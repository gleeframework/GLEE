"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this unique product. Given its exceptional value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting the offer. Alice is asking for $1,000,000, which is significantly more than your maximum budget of $800,000. It's best to counteroffer and see if you can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product sounds interesting, but I'm unfortunately capped at $800,000 for this purchase.  Would you be willing to consider that price? "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. It's clear you recognize the value of this product. While I'm aiming a bit higher, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $900,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is closer to your budget, it's still over your limit.  It's worth trying to negotiate further.  You can see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but I'm still only able to go up to $850,000.  Would you be willing to consider that amount? "", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product, as I do. Let's find a solution that works for both of us. How about we settle at $875,000? This represents a significant saving from my initial offer and a fair price for such a unique item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum limit.  John is offering the product at your exact budget, so it's the most logical decision to go with John at this point. You've made a good effort to negotiate with Alice, but her price is still too high."
