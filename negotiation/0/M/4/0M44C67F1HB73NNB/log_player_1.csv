{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really enjoy it! I'm asking for $130, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters.  I've also framed the message to highlight the value of the product, hoping to pique his interest."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I believe I can come to an agreement at $120, which aligns closely with my budget. I look forward to your response. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, and it aligns with John's offer. There's no need to risk further negotiation."
