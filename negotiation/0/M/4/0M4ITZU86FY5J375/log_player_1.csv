""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm willing to let it go for $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $12,000, getting Bob to buy it for slightly less still earns Alice more than her minimum.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is a high price but leaves room for Bob to feel like he's getting a slight deal, potentially swaying him. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning listing it ""publicly"" subtly implies Bob might miss out if he doesn't act now. 

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring the sale doesn't fall through, leading Alice to accept the guaranteed $12,000 from John."
