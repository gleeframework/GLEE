"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first at a price of $16,000. I believe it holds significant value that will benefit you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $8,000.  There's no reason to accept it at this point.  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $16,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your perspective. However, $16,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. Could you meet me halfway at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your maximum threshold of $8,000. You can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to counter again, potentially reaching a mutually agreeable price."
