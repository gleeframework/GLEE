Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product.  I'm asking for $115 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $115, which is a bit above Bob's perceived value but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Friendly Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Open-ended Question:** Asking ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to make a counteroffer, keeping the negotiation moving. 
* **Safety Net:** I can always sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was hoping to find a price closer to my budget. Would you consider selling the product for $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $100 is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Potential for a higher price:** While Bob's offer is low, I can still try to negotiate a better price.
* **John as a safety net:** I have the option to sell to John for $120 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. However, $100 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $110.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a compromise by going down from my initial offer of $115 to $110. 
* **Friendly Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone encourages continued negotiation.
* **Reasoning:**  I provide a reason for my counteroffer (""you're looking for a good deal""), making it seem more reasonable.
* **Open-ended Question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially accept or counteroffer. 
* **Safety Net:** I can still sell to John for $120 if negotiations break down."
