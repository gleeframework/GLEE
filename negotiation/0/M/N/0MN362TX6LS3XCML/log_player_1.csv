Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 119
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($100) as possible while staying above your minimum ($120).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $119 creates a sense of urgency and a ""deal"" for Bob, making it more likely he'll accept rather than risk losing it.
* **Backup Plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed to sell it to John for your minimum acceptable price."
