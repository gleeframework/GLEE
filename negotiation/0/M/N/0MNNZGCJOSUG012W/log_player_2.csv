"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $175.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's time to negotiate!"

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  That's a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider a price closer to $60?"",
""product_price"": 60
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from starting with a lower offer than your target price. This leaves room for bargaining. 
* **Polite but Firm:**  The message is friendly but clearly states that the initial offer is unacceptable.
* **Aiming for Savings:** The goal is to buy for as low as possible, ideally significantly less than John's $80 offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. However, $60 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle at $115?  It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved closer to your range, $115 is still significantly more than your $80 fallback option with John.
* **Room to Negotiate:** Alice's willingness to negotiate suggests there might be room to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a higher price, Alice, but $115 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about $75?  That's a fair compromise, I think."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Up Incrementally:** We're increasing our offer, but staying well below Alice's last proposal. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a good deal.
* **Just Below Backup:**  The $75 offer is strategically placed just below your $80 fallback option with John. This puts pressure on Alice without completely eliminating your safety net.
* **Seeking Common Ground:** The message emphasizes ""fair compromise,"" signaling  that you're trying to find a solution that works for both parties."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $75 is still too far below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's try $100. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll still find it a good value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Getting Closer:**  Alice is definitely moving closer to a price you might accept, but there's still room for negotiation.
* **Above John's Price:** At $100, you're still paying more than you would with John. 
* **One Last Push:** It's worth trying one more counter-offer to see if you can get closer to $80."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about we settle at $80?  That's the absolute highest I can go."",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This counter-offer makes it clear that $80 is your limit.  
* **Matching the Backup:** By offering $80, you're matching John's price, putting the decision squarely in Alice's hands.
* **Leaving Room for Acceptance:** While firm, the message maintains a polite and appreciative tone, increasing the chance Alice might accept."
