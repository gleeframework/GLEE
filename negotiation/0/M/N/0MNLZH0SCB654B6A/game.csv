"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This accounts for the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
