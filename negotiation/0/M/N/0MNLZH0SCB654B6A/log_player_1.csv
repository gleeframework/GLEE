Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me.  Given my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This accounts for the product's worth while still offering you a competitive price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but $1,250,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear it's going to be a long negotiation to get him close to a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  It's not worth the risk of losing a sure sale."
