"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product.  I know you recognize its value, so I'm starting the negotiation at $1,900,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This allows room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible when you make concessions later.
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $1,900,000, we anchor the negotiation at a high point. Even if this initial offer is rejected, it sets a frame of reference that may lead to a more favorable outcome.
* **Confidence:**  A strong opening offer conveys confidence in the product's value. 

We'll adjust our strategy based on Bob's response in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate the opportunity to purchase your product. Given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant amount, we're aiming higher.  We have ample room to negotiate and still come out significantly ahead of selling to John for $1,200,000. We'll counter in the next round to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While $1,500,000 is a generous offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000. I believe this reflects the product's worth while still acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1750000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We've made a significant concession from our initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Ground:**  We're still well above both our minimum and Bob's offer, aiming for a price that reflects the product's value.
* **Justification:** By reiterating the product's value, we're reinforcing our position and encouraging Bob to consider a higher price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but given my financial situation, I am unable to meet the price of $1,750,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly interested and negotiating seriously.  His counter-offer of $1,600,000 is getting closer to a point where we might accept. However, we're still in a strong position with plenty of rounds to spare. Let's push a little further before considering accepting."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,675,000. I think this is a very fair offer, considering the true value of this product. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 1675000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Smaller Concession:**  We're reducing our concession size to signal that we're nearing our bottom line.
* **Meeting Halfway:** This offer is close to the midpoint between the previous two offers, showing a willingness to compromise but also holding firm on value. 
* **Direct Question:**  Ending with a direct question encourages a response from Bob and keeps the negotiation moving forward."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. After careful consideration, I would like to counter with a price of $1,625,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,625,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,625,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $1,625,000 is a significant profit over our minimum and a good return on the negotiation.
* **Time Value:**  We're past the halfway point in the rounds. While we could potentially squeeze out a bit more, there's a risk Bob will walk away.
* **Opportunity Cost:** Holding out for a slightly higher offer from Bob means potentially losing out on a guaranteed $1,625,000.  

This offer represents a good balance between maximizing profit and minimizing risk."
