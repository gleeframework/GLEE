"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. I'm confident I can get at least $80 from John, so I'm willing to take some risk to try and get a better price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to keep negotiating, hoping to reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85.  This is still above my minimum of $80, but it shows some flexibility and willingness to compromise. I hope this will be enough to incentivize Bob to accept, as it's likely closer to his valuation of the product than my initial offer."
