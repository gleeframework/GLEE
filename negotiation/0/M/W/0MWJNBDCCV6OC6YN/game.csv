"Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,035,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a significant step towards a successful agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1035000.0,Alice,5,
