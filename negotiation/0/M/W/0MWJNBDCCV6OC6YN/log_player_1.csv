Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer of $950,000. That's far too low for me. I believe I can get a better price, especially since I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.  I will counteroffer Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $950,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see something closer to my initial offer. How about $1,050,000?  This is still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,025,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable with it.  I believe I can get a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob. Plus, I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000 if things don't work out. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $1,035,000. This is a fair compromise, and it's a significant step towards a successful agreement.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1035000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit away from a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is the absolute highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  While Bob's offer of $1,030,000 is getting close, it's still below what I need to feel comfortable with. I've only got a few rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity to sell to John for a much higher price."
