Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1500000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1200000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","Since Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is equal to the minimum price I'm willing to accept, I'll choose to sell the product to Bob.
