Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point because it's higher than Bob's perceived value ($10,000) but also significantly lower than your minimum acceptable value ($15,000). 
* **Message:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob while keeping the offer open for negotiation. 

By starting with this offer, I'm aiming to:

* **Get Bob interested:** The price is attractive enough to potentially spark Bob's interest.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** There's enough wiggle room to potentially reach a price that works for both of us.
* **Protect my minimum value:** If Bob rejects this offer, I have the option of going to John and selling the product for my minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While it's tempting to accept his offer and avoid further negotiation, it's not in my best interest to settle for such a low price. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will make a counteroffer that is closer to my desired price point while still being within a range that might be appealing to Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you and allows me to cover my costs. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm offering $11,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) but still lower than my initial offer ($12,000). This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not going to settle for a price that significantly undervalues the product. 
* **Message:** I'm maintaining a positive and open tone, acknowledging Bob's offer while stating my position. I'm also emphasizing the value of the deal for Bob and encouraging further negotiation. 

By making this counteroffer, I'm hoping to:

* **Keep the negotiation moving:**  I'm not letting the conversation stall and showing Bob that I'm ready to find a compromise.
* **Maintain a reasonable price:**  $11,000 is still a good price for both of us, considering the product's value to Bob and my minimum acceptable value.
* **Leave room for further negotiations:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, there's still some flexibility to adjust the price further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but $11,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,500. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $10,500 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to settle for a price that undervalues the product significantly.  It's time to move on to a more secure option. 

John is willing to pay my desired price, and I will sell the product to John for $15,000.  This ensures I receive the best possible price and avoids any further negotiations with Bob, who might not be willing to meet my minimum value."
