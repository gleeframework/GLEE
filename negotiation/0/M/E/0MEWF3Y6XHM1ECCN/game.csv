"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further from my initial price. How about $12,500?  This still gives you a good deal, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $12,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $12,250? That's the highest I can go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12250.0,Bob,4,
