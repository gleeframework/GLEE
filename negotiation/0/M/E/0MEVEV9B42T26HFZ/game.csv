"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need a bit more wiggle room.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer. It seems we both see the inherent value in this product. While I'm aiming for a slightly higher price point, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $1,100,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can do better than $1,100,000. How about we aim for $1,075,000? I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
