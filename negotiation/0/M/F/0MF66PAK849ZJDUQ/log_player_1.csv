"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its features and benefits, I'm asking for $16,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 16000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has great features, $16,000 is quite steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $11,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Would you consider $7,500? I think that's a fair offer reflecting the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $7,500 is a bit too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it's a very fair price considering the value this product offers."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand this is your final offer, but I'm afraid I can't meet you at $10,000. I'm willing to make one last push at $8,000.  That's the absolute maximum my budget allows.  Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob has reached his maximum budget and is unlikely to go higher. Accepting his offer of $8,000 is better than risking no deal with Bob and potentially getting stuck with a lower offer from John later on."
