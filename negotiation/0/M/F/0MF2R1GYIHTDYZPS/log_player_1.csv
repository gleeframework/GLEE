"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. My asking price is $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $100, which is above Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Friendly Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to build a positive rapport. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm not being overly aggressive and showing willingness to negotiate.  

**Strategy:**

* I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate. 
* If he rejects, I can adjust my offer slightly lower in the next round.
*  If he accepts, I've made a good starting profit. 
* I'm always aware of the option to sell to John for $120 if the negotiation with Bob drags on or becomes unproductive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  How about $85?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $85 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe I can still get a better price from Bob or John. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain control of the negotiation and potentially get closer to my desired price.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, aiming for a price closer to $100.
* I'll keep John as a backup option in case the negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $85 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $95? That's still a great deal for a product like this."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm making a counteroffer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining some leverage in the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:**  I'm reminding Bob of the value of the product to encourage him to accept my offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm trying to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. 
* If Bob accepts, I'll have a successful negotiation. 
* If he rejects, I'll continue to negotiate, keeping John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm really interested, but I can't go higher than $90.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $90 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Closing in on Target:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.
* **Risk of Selling to John:**  While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I want to exhaust all options with Bob before resorting to that.

**Strategy:**

* I'll counteroffer Bob with a price slightly lower than my previous offer, aiming for a price closer to $100.
* I'll be prepared to accept John's offer if the negotiation with Bob doesn't lead to a satisfactory outcome."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $92?  That's a fair price for both of us, and I think we can close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price slightly lower than my previous counteroffer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm focusing on a ""fair price"" and a successful closure to encourage acceptance.
* **Remaining Firm:**  I'm still above my minimum acceptable price of $120, but demonstrating flexibility.

**Strategy:**

* I'm aiming for a deal that's reasonably close to my target price.
*  I'm gauging Bob's willingness to meet me halfway. 
* If Bob rejects, I'll consider the value of John's offer and decide if I should sell to him or continue with Bob."
