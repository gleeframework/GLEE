"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $11,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $12,500?  This reflects the true value of the product.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, $12,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $11,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. Can we meet at this price?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, $11,500 is cutting it very close to my bottom line. I'd be willing to accept $12,000, but that's my final offer.  It's a fantastic deal for a product of this quality.",12000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that $12,000 is your bottom line, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a new counteroffer of $11,800. I'm willing to stretch a bit, but I need to stay within my means. Can we meet at this price?",11800.0,Bob,6,
