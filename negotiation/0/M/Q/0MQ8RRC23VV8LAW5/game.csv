"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. ",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the value this product holds, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we settle at $1,150,000? It's a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you consider $1,250,000? This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. ",1250000.0,Alice,5,
