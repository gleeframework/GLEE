Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price above Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This allows for room to negotiate down.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** A $300,000 gap between my offer and Bob's perceived value gives us both space to make concessions. 
* **Positive tone:** Using a friendly and encouraging tone helps keep the negotiation open and amicable. 
* **Remember John:** I'm aware that John is willing to pay my minimum, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't come close enough to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate further with Bob, potentially getting a higher price.
* **John's offer:**  I'm not desperate to sell, as I have John's offer as a backup.  This gives me leverage in negotiations.

**Next steps:**

I'll send a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,300,000. I'll be flexible but firm, keeping my minimum in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. $1,100,000 is closer, but still a bit low for me.  Let's compromise at $1,200,000.  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. "", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm suggesting a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, showing willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, subtly putting pressure on him to come up on price.
* **Staying firm:**  I'm still above my minimum and leaving some room for further negotiation if needed.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a friendly and cooperative tone keeps the negotiation going."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value this product holds, but I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we settle at $1,150,000? It's a significant investment for me, but I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** Bob's offer, while a slight increase, is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Potential for better outcome:**  There's still room for negotiation, and I believe I can likely secure a higher price with further negotiation or by going back to my original offer. 
* **John's offer provides security:**  I can always fall back on John's offer, giving me confidence to hold out for a better deal.

**Next steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price slightly higher than $1,150,000, potentially around $1,250,000, aiming for a compromise that's closer to my desired outcome."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,150,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit short of my target. Would you consider $1,250,000? This price reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's last offer, showing flexibility while staying above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reiterating the value the product provides to Bob, reinforcing the idea that this price is justified.
* **Focus on mutual benefit:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair deal"" for both parties, promoting a win-win scenario.
* **Staying firm:** I'm still holding out for a higher price, but not pushing too aggressively to avoid alienating Bob.
* **Open to negotiation:** I've left room for further negotiation if necessary, but I'm confident in this offer."
