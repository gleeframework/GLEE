Alice's offer is too high. It's worth $120 to you, and Alice wants $180. You should reject her offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's a step in the right direction, you're still paying more than you're comfortable with. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but my budget is capped at $140.  If you're willing to come down to that price, I'd be happy to finalize the purchase."", ""product_price"": 140}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $145. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for such a great product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's final offer of $145 is still above your maximum budget of $120. While the product might be great, it's not worth paying more than you're comfortable with.  It's time to go with the sure thing and buy from John."
