Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,280,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000.

Alice is clearly signaling this is her final offer.  While I could try to push for a slightly lower price, the potential savings are minimal compared to the risk of her walking away. Accepting at $1,280,000 secures a good deal."
