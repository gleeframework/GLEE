Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer and understand the value of the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $2,000,000 price point. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, I still need to stay within my budget. I am prepared to offer $1,400,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

While Bob is moving closer to my price, it's clear he's unlikely to meet my minimum. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000 which is more than Bob is currently offering and avoids further negotiation."
