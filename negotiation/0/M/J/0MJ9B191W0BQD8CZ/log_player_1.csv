I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,700,000. This is a price higher than what it's worth to him, but I believe it's a fair starting point given that it's lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm confident I can get a price closer to my minimum given John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I consider fair.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering Bob's offer with a price of $1,550,000. This is still higher than what the product is worth to him, but it's closer to my minimum acceptable price and is a good compromise given John's offer.  I hope Bob sees this as a reasonable price and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum.  I'm confident I can get a better price by selling to John."
