Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I've already discounted the price significantly from my initial offer. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $100?

**Reasoning:**

While Alice is coming down on price, she's still significantly above our maximum budget.  At this point, we're risking her digging in and us losing the opportunity to buy from John at $80.  It's time to cut our losses and take the guaranteed good deal."
