Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to you, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant return you stand to gain."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $925,000 allows for some negotiation downward while still staying significantly above your minimum acceptable price.
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and the ""significant return"" helps justify the high price to Bob.

This strategy aims for a win-win situation. Bob gets the product he values highly, and you secure a price significantly higher than your backup offer from John."
