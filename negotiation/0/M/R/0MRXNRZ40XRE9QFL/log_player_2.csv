"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be a valuable asset to your company. It's worth $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount considering its value to you, and it would be a mutually beneficial transaction. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and significantly cheaper than buying from John."
