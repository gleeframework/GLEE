"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, but leaving room for negotiation.  I know Bob values the product at $1,500,000, so I'm confident he'll see this as a good deal.  I'll see how he responds and adjust my strategy from there."

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $1,150,000 is still too low.  I'm confident I can squeeze out a bit more, and I'm not willing to settle yet. I'll counteroffer again."

It's getting down to the wire, but I'm still hoping to squeeze out a bit more.  I'm confident that Bob will accept this price, as it's only a little more than his last offer and we both know that it's more profitable for us to reach a deal than for me to sell to John."
