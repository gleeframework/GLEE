"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll make a counteroffer of $11000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $11000. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10500 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit, so I'll make another counteroffer. I'm willing to meet you at $11200, but I think I can do better than that. I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal - I'll include a free premium service package that's normally worth $2000. So, the total price would be $11200 for the product, plus the $2000 service package, totaling $13200. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate the extras you're throwing in, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $10800 for the product, and I'll take the premium service package as part of the deal. Can you consider this offer?",10800.0,Bob,6,
