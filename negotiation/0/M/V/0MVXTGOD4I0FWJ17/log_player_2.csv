You're trying to save as much money as possible, and Alice's offer is still higher than your ideal price.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer allows you to try and negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $11,000? It's a small compromise for a product you'll find valuable.

While $11,000 is closer to your ideal price, it's still higher than what you're aiming for.  Rejecting and making another counteroffer gives you another opportunity to negotiate and potentially secure a better price."
