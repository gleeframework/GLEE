"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is above Bob's perceived value of $8,000, but significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, highlighting the value of the product for Bob. 

**Strategy:**

This opening offer is a good starting point. It gives Bob a chance to accept the offer if he sees value, and allows for negotiation if he doesn't. I'm leaving room to negotiate and hopefully meet somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum price of $15,000. I'm not desperate for a sale, and I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay my asking price. 

**Strategy:**

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer. This will show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not going to settle for a price far below my minimum. I have 8 more rounds to potentially reach a deal with Bob, so I'm not in a rush."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a great deal on a valuable product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $11,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer and shows flexibility.
* **Message:** I acknowledge Bob's offer and explain my reasoning for a higher price. I'm emphasizing the value of the product and using language like ""fair"" and ""great deal"" to make it appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer maintains my negotiating position while showing willingness to compromise. The lower price could sway Bob, and if not, it leaves room for further negotiation in the coming rounds. I'm aiming for a deal that benefits both of us while staying within my minimum value threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $11000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9500 for it. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who values the product at my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to push the price closer to my desired value.  By rejecting this offer, I can counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my last offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a strong position. I still have 6 rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about $10,500? It's a compromise from both of our last offers, and it allows you to get this valuable product at a great price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's desire for a good deal and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm framing the offer as a ""compromise"" to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a strategic move to potentially close the deal. By making a considerable reduction, I'm putting pressure on Bob to accept.  However, I'm still above his last offer, and I have the safety net of John's offer if Bob continues to be unwilling."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to pay $10000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000. I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who values the product at my minimum.

**Strategy:**

I'm going to continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to push the price closer to my desired value. By rejecting this offer, I can counteroffer with a price slightly lower than my last offer, showing flexibility while maintaining a strong position. I still have 4 rounds to try and reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While $10,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still a bit away from my ideal price. To show you I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to come down to $10,250. It's a fair compromise that gets us closer to a deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm lowering my price to $10,250. This is a small compromise from my previous offer, signaling my willingness to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm reiterating my appreciation for Bob's interest and framing the offer as a ""fair compromise"" to make it more appealing.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer is a calculated move to potentially push Bob towards acceptance. The price is still above his last offer, but it's a significant reduction from my initial price. If Bob still hesitates, I still have 3 rounds to potentially reach a deal before resorting to John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9800 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping you'll meet me at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up in his offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum of $15,000.  I'm not desperate to sell and have a guaranteed buyer in John who values the product at my minimum.  With only two rounds left, I don't believe I can reach a mutually agreeable price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  This ensures I receive my desired value and avoids risking a deal with Bob that would leave me with a significantly lower profit.  While it's disappointing to not reach an agreement with Bob, it's a strategic decision to maximize my earnings."
