"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would be a great addition to your collection. Given its high value and quality, I propose a price of $100 for it. I understand its worth to you might be higher, but I hope this offer aligns with your budget while ensuring a fair transaction for us. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget ($120).** You are willing to spend no more than $120. 
* **You can do better:** You have the option to counter-offer Alice and potentially get a lower price. There's room for negotiation since the product is worth $80 to Alice.

By rejecting, you open the opportunity for a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
