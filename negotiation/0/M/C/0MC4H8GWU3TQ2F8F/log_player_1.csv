Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product, $100 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. This is a fair price for both of us, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
