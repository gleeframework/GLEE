{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is more than Bob is willing to pay, but it's still significantly lower than your minimum value of $15,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** This offer allows for some back and forth, giving you the opportunity to adjust the price based on Bob's response. 
* **It shows good faith:** By offering a price lower than your minimum, you're demonstrating you're open to negotiation and a mutually beneficial deal.

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and use it to determine my next move, keeping in mind my $15,000 minimum and the potential to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and significantly lower than my initial offer of $12,000. 

I'll proceed to the next round and send Bob a counteroffer. I want to see if he's willing to move closer to my asking price, and I'm prepared to walk away if he doesn't.  The option of selling to John for $15,000 is always on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,000 is simply too far below my minimum asking price. I'm willing to come down to $11,000 to meet you halfway. Let me know if you're willing to work with me at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer is strategically designed to:

* **Show flexibility:** While I'm not accepting Bob's initial offer, I'm demonstrating a willingness to negotiate and adjust my price.
* **Stay above my minimum:**  $11,000 is still above my $15,000 minimum, ensuring I don't lose out on a valuable deal.
* **Gauge Bob's commitment:**  By offering a price that is closer to my initial offer, I can gauge Bob's seriousness and whether he's willing to meet me halfway.

If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll consider selling to John for $15,000.  I need to weigh the potential of further negotiation with Bob against the certainty of a quick sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $10,500. Can we meet in the middle at $10,750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to accept Bob's offer. Here's why:

* **Close to my minimum:** While $10,750 is still below my ideal price, it's very close to my minimum of $15,000. 
* **Potential for further negotiation:** Bob seems willing to negotiate, and there's a chance I could potentially push for a slightly higher price in the future. 
* **Risk of losing a sale:** If I reject Bob's offer, I risk him walking away completely, leaving me with only the option of selling to John.

Therefore, accepting this offer allows me to secure a sale quickly while still getting a price that's reasonably close to my minimum."
