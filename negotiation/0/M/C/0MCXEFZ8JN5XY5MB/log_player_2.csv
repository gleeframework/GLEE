"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $11,500.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get a better deal by counteroffering.  $11,500 is still too high for him, and he has room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product but $11,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now.  Would you be open to $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still aiming for a bit higher price to make this work for me.  How about $11,000? This would still represent a good deal for you, as the product is worth $12,000 to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $11,000 is closer to his desired price, he can still try to negotiate further.  There are several rounds left, and he can potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,750.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to me.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $10,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $10,900? It's a fair compromise that benefits us both, and it allows me to move forward with the sale.  Let's close this deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Bob should accept Alice's offer.  $10,900 is a good price for him, as it's lower than what he'd pay John.  While he might be able to squeeze out an even lower price, the risk of failing to reach an agreement with Alice and having to buy from John at a higher price is not worth it."
