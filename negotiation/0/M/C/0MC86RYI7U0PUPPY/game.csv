"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $12,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $16,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's try to reach an agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
