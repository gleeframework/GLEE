"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are trying to save as much money as possible, and $14,000 is still above your budget. You have the option to counteroffer and see if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget, but I need to make a bit more than $12500 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. You should reject her offer and continue negotiating to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $13125? This way, you get a good deal and I can continue negotiating. Let's try to make this happen! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You've negotiated with Alice for a few rounds now, and while she's coming down in price, it's still not quite within your budget.  Since you have the option to buy from John for $12,000, which is within your budget, it's the most logical choice at this point. You're saving yourself further negotiation and ensuring you get the product at your desired price."
