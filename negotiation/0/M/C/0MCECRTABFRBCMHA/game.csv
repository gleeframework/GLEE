"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $14000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12500 for the product. Let me know what you think.",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget, but I need to make a bit more than $12500 to make this worthwhile for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13250? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let me know what you think.",13250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $13250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $13000.  I'm serious about buying this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $13125? This way, you get a good deal and I can continue negotiating. Let's try to make this happen!",13125.0,Alice,5,
