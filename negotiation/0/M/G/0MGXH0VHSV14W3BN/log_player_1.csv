Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's worth. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""its value,"" I subtly imply the product is worth the asking price.
* **Alternative Option:**  By mentioning listing it publicly, I subtly remind Bob that he might lose the opportunity to a competitor.
* **Polite and Open:** The tone is crucial. I want to keep the conversation open and non-confrontational, encouraging Bob to counter-offer if he's not immediately sold.

While I have a guaranteed buyer at $8,000, there's a chance Bob is willing to pay a premium to secure the product quickly and without competition."
