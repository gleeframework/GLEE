Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was hoping we could find a price that's a bit more reasonable. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I'll try to negotiate further with Bob."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $850,000 is simply too low for me to consider.  I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still represents a significant value to you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price. Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to come down from your initial price. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $875,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

While $875,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer! I appreciate your continued effort to find a price that works for us.  However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. How about we split the difference and go with $887,500? This would be a win-win, ensuring you get a great deal and allowing me to make a decent profit."", ""product_price"": 887500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I'd ideally like a bit more, $880,000 is a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation to stall. It's above my minimum, and we're close to the end of our allotted rounds."
