"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This would allow me to make a reasonable profit while still offering you a great value for your investment. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $920,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me in the middle at $910,000?",910000.0,Bob,4,
