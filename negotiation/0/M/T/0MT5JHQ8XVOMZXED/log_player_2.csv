"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John, so there's no reason to accept Alice's offer of $100.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much as possible. Offering $90 is a reasonable starting point, as it's below Alice's offer and still leaves some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's acceptable price of $120, it's still higher than Bob's last counteroffer of $90.  There's still room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. $95 is a compromise between Alice's latest offer of $110 and Bob's previous offer of $90. It shows Bob is serious about buying the product while still aiming for a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's limit, there's still a chance for negotiation. Bob is only $5 away from his acceptable price with John, so it's worth pushing for a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but still wants to save money. Offering $100 is a compromise, as it's closer to Alice's offer of $115 and also within Bob's acceptable range for a good deal. This counteroffer shows Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to get the product at a lower price than John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has only 3 rounds left. Alice's offer of $110 is only $10 more than Bob's last counteroffer of $100. It's risky to continue negotiating, as there's a chance Alice will not budge further, and Bob will be forced to buy from John at $120. Accepting Alice's offer is the safest option, as it secures the product within Bob's price range and avoids the risk of having to pay more to John."
