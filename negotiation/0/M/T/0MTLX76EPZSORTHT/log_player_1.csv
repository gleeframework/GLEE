"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,100,000 feels fair. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm aiming high initially to establish a strong bargaining position. This leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""potential value,"" I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's worth to him without directly revealing my knowledge of his valuation.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative. I'm inviting Bob's feedback and signaling a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a significant amount, it's still considerably lower than both my initial asking price and Bob's perceived value.  Rejecting this offer signals that I'm serious about getting a price that reflects the product's worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, but not at such a steep drop."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I believe $900,000 undervalues the potential this product offers.  To find a middle ground, I'd be willing to let it go for $1,025,000. This feels like a fair compromise considering its value proposition."", 
""product_price"": 1025000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I've made a significant concession from my initial offer, signaling a willingness to negotiate.
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Middle Ground:**  The new price is a substantial move towards Bob's offer, aiming to find a compromise that benefits both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we try $975,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob's willingness to meet in the middle demonstrates a genuine interest in closing the deal. 
* **Time Value:**  Prolonging negotiations carries the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away. Accepting now secures a favorable outcome."
