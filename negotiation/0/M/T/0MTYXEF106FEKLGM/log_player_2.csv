"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a significant discount, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product for $13,500, which is less than your $15,000 maximum budget and significantly less than John's $15,000 offer. Accepting Alice's offer saves you the most money."
