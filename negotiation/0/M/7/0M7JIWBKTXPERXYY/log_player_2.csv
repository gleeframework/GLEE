"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I am pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm confident we can reach a price that benefits both of us.  To start the negotiation, I propose a price of $1,350,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still above my ideal price.  I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,350,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'd like to offer you $1,200,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit and allow me to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is significantly below my minimum. This product holds immense value, and I'm confident it can bring you even greater returns. How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,275,000 is closer to my ideal price, and it's still a good deal for me compared to buying from John. While I'd prefer to pay even less, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John isn't worth it at this point."
