"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $800000. I believe that's a more reasonable price for this asset. Let me know if you're willing to meet me in the middle.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest!  While I appreciate your offer, $800000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1200000. This reflects the unique value of this product, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1200000, but I still think that's a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to propose $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
