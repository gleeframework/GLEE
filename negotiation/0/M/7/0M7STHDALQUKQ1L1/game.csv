"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While that initial offer is significantly lower than I could consider, I understand there's room for negotiation.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000?",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, we are still quite far apart.  I can appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but that number is still much higher than I can do.  I could consider a price closer to  $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm seeing a gap here between what we both consider reasonable.  I'm willing to come down further, but I need you to move up significantly. Would you be willing to consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
