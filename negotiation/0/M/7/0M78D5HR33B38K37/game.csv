"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $80. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this great product.",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $95? That's closer to what I had in mind.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, I'm still a bit above $95. How about we try $105? I think that's a fair price for this product, and it's still a good deal for you.",105.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I think we're getting bogged down.  I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers at $100 even.  That's the best I can do.",100.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob! However, I'm not willing to sell for $100. I'm willing to make one more concession, so how about we try $115? It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price for this product.",115.0,Alice,7,
