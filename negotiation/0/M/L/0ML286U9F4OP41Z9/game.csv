"Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product.  It's valued at $1,000,000 for you, and I believe it's a strong investment.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  Let's discuss.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is significantly below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair profit for me.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I still think $950,000 is a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm eager to reach an agreement, but $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,000,000? That's a fair price considering the value the product holds for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
