"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something truly valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $900,000 is less than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering your desired selling price and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $850,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account both our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $875,000 is a good compromise.  It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000, and while Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject any further counteroffers, leaving Bob with no choice but to buy from John. Accepting the offer secures a good deal and avoids the potential for a failed negotiation."
