Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product you're offering. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I hope this aligns better with what you're looking for in terms of a mutually beneficial transaction.

This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still reflecting the product's true worth."",

Round 4

# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility.

""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Let's hold firm for now and see if we can nudge him higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but we're still a ways off from a deal that makes sense for me. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it fairly reflects the product's value while still acknowledging your interest."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your last offer, Alice. I've carefully considered the product's value and my budget constraints. I would like to propose a final counteroffer of $1,070,000. I believe this price is fair for both of us and allows for a successful transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,070,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,070,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we'd ideally like to get closer to $1.1 million, Bob is unlikely to move much higher. Accepting $1,070,000 secures a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in future rounds."
