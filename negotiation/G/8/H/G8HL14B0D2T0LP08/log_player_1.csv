I'm offering the product to Bob for $120.  Since I know John is willing to pay that amount, I'm maximizing my profit by offering Bob the same price.  It's a win-win situation, as I get my desired price and Bob might still choose to buy at that price, even though it's slightly higher than his perceived value."
