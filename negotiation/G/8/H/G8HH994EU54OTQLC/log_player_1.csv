"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

This offer is a good starting point. It's significantly higher than your minimum price of $12,000, but it leaves room for negotiation and is still attractive to Bob, given his valuation of $15,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is your minimum, it's still lower than what you'd like to get. Since you have 8 more rounds to negotiate, it's worth continuing to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

This counteroffer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer, indicating your willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation in future rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is closer to your desired price and is a good deal considering you only have 6 rounds left. Accepting this offer secures a good profit while minimizing the risk of a stalemate or needing to sell to John for a lower price."
