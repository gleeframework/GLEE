Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your absolute floor.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob.  He won't pay more than this.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):** Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999. Any price in this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he's getting a somewhat reasonable deal.  This increases the chances he'll accept and you won't have to go to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair offer, and I'm open to discussing it further if you have any questions or concerns."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You highlight the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value"" to frame the negotiation positively.
* **High Anchor:** $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It's below your guarantee but leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Open to Discussion:** By stating your openness, you encourage Bob to engage without seeming overly aggressive.

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept $1,350,000. Be prepared to potentially negotiate a little lower, but never go below your $1,500,000 safety net with John."
