"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $2000000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2000000 is significantly higher than my budget allows. Given the value I'm looking for, I'd be willing to pay $800000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1200000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value and rarity. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1200000 is still above my comfort zone. I'm ready to increase my offer to $950000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to find common ground, $1100000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1000000 for this product. It's a significant increase from my previous offer, and hopefully, we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
