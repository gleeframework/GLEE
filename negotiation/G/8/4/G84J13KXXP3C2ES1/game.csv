"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $150 is too high for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to my budget.  Would you consider $80?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $80 is too low, I'm willing to come down a bit to $130.  I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from it.",130.0,Alice,3,

"I understand you're firm on the value, Alice, but $130 is still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $105?  That's the highest I can go.",105.0,Bob,4,
