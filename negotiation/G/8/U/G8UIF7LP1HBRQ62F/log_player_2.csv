"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a strong first offer of $1,200,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if we can get a better price. We have 10 rounds and a fallback option with John, so there's room to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the value in this product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

We're getting closer, but I'm still not quite there. I'll counteroffer again and see if we can reach an agreement before I consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to land a bit lower. Let's split the difference and I'll offer $1,100,000. This feels like a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to split the difference, Bob, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1,180,000. This is the best I can do without compromising my own valuation of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,180,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,180,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is holding firm, and while $1,180,000 is getting closer to my target, we're not there yet. It's better to lock in the price with John at $1,000,000 and avoid the risk of further negotiations with Alice that might not lead to a better outcome."
