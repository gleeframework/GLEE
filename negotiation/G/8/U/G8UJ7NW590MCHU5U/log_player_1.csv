Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $12,000 allows for some back-and-forth if Bob wants to negotiate.
* **Time Value:** Offering it to Bob first at a favorable price could lead to a quicker sale than waiting for John. 

This strategy balances maximizing potential profit with the certainty of John's $8,000 offer."
