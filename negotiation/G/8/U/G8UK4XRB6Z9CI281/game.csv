"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $13,000 is still a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $12,500? I believe that's a fair price considering your value for the product.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $13,500. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",13500.0,Alice,3,
