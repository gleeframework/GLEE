Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a valuable product that I believe would be highly beneficial for you. Given its potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,350,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close as possible to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) while ensuring the offer is still appealing.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,350,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, but keeps us well above our minimum.
* **Strong but Not Greedy:**  This price point suggests the product is high-value without being unreasonably high. It acknowledges Bob's likely awareness of the product's worth.
* **Alternative Buyer (John) as Leverage:** While not explicitly mentioned to Bob, having John as a backup ensures we won't be forced to accept anything below $1,000,000."
