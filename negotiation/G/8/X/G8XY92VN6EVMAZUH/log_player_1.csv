"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
$5,000 is far too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price from Bob or John. I'm going to counter Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000? This would give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $6,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would be a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,500 is better than $5,000, it's still far below what the product is worth to me. I'm going to counter Bob's offer again.  I'm willing to negotiate but need to ensure I get a price closer to my minimum acceptable value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
