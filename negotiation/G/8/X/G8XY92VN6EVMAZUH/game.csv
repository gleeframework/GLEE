"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what it's worth to me and still a good value for you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $5,000 is simply not enough for me.  Let's split the difference â€“ how about $9,000? This would give you a good deal and allow me to get closer to my asking price.  What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $6,500? That's a significant increase from my last offer and would be a good deal for me.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $6,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away happy. Let's make this happen!",8500.0,Alice,5,
