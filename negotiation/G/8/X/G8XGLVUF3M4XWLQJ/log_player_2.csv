You can do better than $14,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $13,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $13,500? Let's make this happen!

You're still closer to your goal of $13,000, and it seems like Alice is willing to negotiate.  Let's try one more counteroffer to see if we can meet in the middle."
