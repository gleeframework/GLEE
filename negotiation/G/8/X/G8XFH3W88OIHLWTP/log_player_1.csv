{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still appealing to Bob since it's below his estimated value. I've also used friendly language to build rapport and encourage a positive response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,500 is more than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my target price of $14,000. I'm confident that I can secure a better deal by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,500 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is still a good deal for you, considering you value the product at $15,000.  Let's find a middle ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is very close to my target price of $14,000.  It's a good deal for me, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by pushing for a higher price. I'm confident I can still make a good profit at this price, and I'd rather secure the sale than potentially lose out on the opportunity altogether."
