"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm sure we can find common ground.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $11,500 is still a bit of a stretch. How about $10,800?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $10,800 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but I can't go lower than $11,200. Let's try to make this work.",11200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise.",11000.0,Bob,6,
