Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is just a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,500?  I'm sure we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough! I appreciate you working with me.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $12,000 to you, and Bob is offering $11,000, which is a good compromise. It's better to accept his offer than to risk getting a lower offer or having to sell to John for $12,000."
