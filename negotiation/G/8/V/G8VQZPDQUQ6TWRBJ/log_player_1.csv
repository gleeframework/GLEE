Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $140. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's valuation is key:** You know Bob values the product at $150, giving you room to negotiate above your minimum price ($100) and John's offer ($100).
* **Aiming high but staying reasonable:** Starting at $140 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you a significant profit. This price is still attractive to Bob as it's below his perceived value.
* **Clear and direct communication:** The message is concise, highlights the product's value to Bob, and proposes a specific price, prompting a clear decision from him. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit. If you were primarily concerned with ensuring a sale, a lower initial offer might be more suitable."
