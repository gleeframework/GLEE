"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $100 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $95. Let me know if this works for you or if you'd like to make a counteroffer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good price, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Since he has the option to buy from John for $80, rejecting the initial offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend no more than $80 on this product. I'm happy to buy it from you for that price. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 80}
