"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,100,000.  This is a good starting point because it's less than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also signals that I'm serious about getting a good price for my product."

```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum price, I'm not yet ready to sell at that price.  I'm going to counter with a higher price in the next round.  I want to see if I can get closer to my desired $1,000,000."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  I've been negotiating with Bob for several rounds, and it seems unlikely he'll meet my desired price.  John's offer is a good deal, and it's better than risking another round with Bob.  I'd rather have a guaranteed sale and be done with the negotiation."
