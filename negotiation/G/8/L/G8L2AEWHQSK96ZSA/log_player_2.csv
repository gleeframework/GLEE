"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which I believe would greatly benefit you. Given its value and potential impact on your needs, I propose a price of $10,000 for it. This offer is tailored to provide you with significant savings compared to the market value of $12,000 while still allowing me to recover a substantial portion of the product's worth. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is less than her stated value, you know you can get the product for $8,000 from John. Rejecting this offer opens the door for a better deal, either from Alice in a counter-offer or by sticking with your option to buy from John."
