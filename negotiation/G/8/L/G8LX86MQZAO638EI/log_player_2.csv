``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer:** $130
* **Your maximum budget:** $150
* **John's price:** $150

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could try to negotiate further with Alice, there's no guarantee she'll go lower, and you risk losing the deal altogether."
