Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need at least $1,000,000 (your value from John).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. 
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):**  Any price between $1,000,001 and $1,199,999 works for both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA, leaving room for potential negotiation but maximizing your potential profit.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You start by highlighting the product's value, setting a positive tone.
* **High Anchor:** $1,150,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA.  
* **Justification:** You provide a brief reason for the price (""fair price considering the significant benefits"").
* **Open to Negotiation:**  While firm, the tone leaves room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher within the ZOPA. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is paramount, a slightly less aggressive opening price might be preferable."
