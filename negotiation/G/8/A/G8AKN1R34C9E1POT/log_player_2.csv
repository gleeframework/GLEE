"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly below its market value.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal by negotiating.  He has a higher budget and Alice clearly wants to sell the product.  There's room for both sides to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,250,000.  This still gives you a substantial profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's work together to make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1250000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000, which still gives you a significant profit.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still in a good position. Alice is willing to negotiate, and he can likely get a price closer to his target of $1,250,000.  Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation going and gives him more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
