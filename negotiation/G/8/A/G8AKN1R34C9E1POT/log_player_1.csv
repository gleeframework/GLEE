Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1250000.  This still gives you a substantial profit, and it's a price I'm comfortable with.  Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's close to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal by continuing the negotiation."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which still gives you a significant profit.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's split the difference and I'll pay $1300000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'll accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a bit more, $1,300,000 is a good price and it's likely I won't get a better offer from Bob.  It's important to secure a sale and I'm confident I can make up for the difference with other ventures."
