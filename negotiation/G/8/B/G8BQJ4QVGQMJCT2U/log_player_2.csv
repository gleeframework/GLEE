Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $760,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a price that's reasonable for the product's value. I'm counteroffering at $820,000. This is my final offer for this round.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your final offer for this round, but I'm still a bit away from that number.  To be fair to both of us, how about we settle at $790,000? This shows I'm willing to move closer to your price."", ""product_price"": 790000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to move closer to my price, but $790,000 is still a bit short of my target. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to try to reach a deal. I'm counteroffering at $815,000. This is my last offer, and I hope we can finalize the sale at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $815,000.

This is a tough one, but at $815,000, we're getting close to Alice's likely bottom line.  Pushing further risks her walking away, and while we have rounds left, we're better off securing a reasonable deal now than potentially ending up with John's offer."
