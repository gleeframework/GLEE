Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it holds significant value for you, and this price reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Secure a Significant Gain:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, selling at $14,500 is a considerable profit compared to John's $12,000 offer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between ambition and the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
