"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $9,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum price point. It's best to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I'm interested in the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $7,500. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've got to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $8,500 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target price, it's still above his maximum of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  I'm still a little high, but I can offer $8,250. This is my final offer, as I'm happy to go with John at this point if we can't reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about being willing to go with John if we can't reach an agreement. I'm not willing to go below $8,750, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle of our last two offers. How about $8,625? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,625. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,625
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  While Alice is getting closer to his price point, it's still above his maximum of $8,000.  He's already stated his final offer, and with only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely he'll get a better price from Alice. It's better to lock in the $8,000 price from John."
