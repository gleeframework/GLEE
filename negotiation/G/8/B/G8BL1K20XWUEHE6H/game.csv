"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Could you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is simply too low.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000. This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to secure a fair price for my product.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
