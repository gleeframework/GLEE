Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'll find very valuable. I'm happy to offer it to you for $9,500."", ""product_price"": 9500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  Would you consider $9,000?  I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $9,000 is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $8,750. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reasoning: While I could push for a slightly higher price, accepting $8,750 is a significant profit above my minimum ($8,000) and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in further rounds.
