{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. I think this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This is a starting offer that's slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. It leaves room for negotiation but still allows me to make a profit.  I'm hoping Bob will accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if he doesn't."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my goal of $10,000."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for coming down in price. I appreciate your flexibility. I'm still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to pay $8800 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While he's getting closer to my minimum, I'm still not comfortable selling for that low of a price. I want to see if I can push him a bit higher with a counteroffer."
