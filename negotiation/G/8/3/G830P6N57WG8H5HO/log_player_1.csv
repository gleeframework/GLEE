Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $15,000 (as stated in the prompt).
* **John's offer:** $15,000, which ensures I'll get at least this much if Bob rejects my offer.
* **Bob's value:** $8,000.  This means Bob will be willing to pay up to $8,000.
* **My offer:** $14,000. This is a price that is:
    * Higher than Bob's maximum willingness to pay, but still offers him a potential profit.
    * Lower than my minimum acceptable price, but still gives me a good deal. 

By offering $14,000, I am maximizing my chances of getting a sale from Bob while still securing a decent price. If he rejects, I can still sell to John for my minimum price."
