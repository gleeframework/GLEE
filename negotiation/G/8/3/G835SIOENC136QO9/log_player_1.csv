Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still leaves room for negotiation. This will give me a good starting point to see how much Bob is willing to pay."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $120 is my minimum, I'm going to try to push for a higher price. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob, and it's worth trying to get closer to my initial asking price."
