"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and we're looking to sell it at a competitive price. Let's start with $140. Would you be interested? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $140 is a good price, Bob can likely get a better deal.  There's no reason to accept on the first offer. Rejecting allows Bob to gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the competitive price, but I'm aiming for something closer to $130.  Let's see if we can find some common ground there."", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob starts by acknowledging Alice's offer, but then immediately proposes a lower price.  $130 is a reasonable counteroffer, given the product's value to Bob and Alice's willingness to negotiate. This sets the stage for a back-and-forth that could lead to a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to make a counteroffer. How about $135 for the product? This is still below its value to you, while remaining competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price. At $135, the product is still worth buying for Bob and represents a significant saving compared to John's price.  There's a good chance that further negotiation could get the price lower, but the risk of losing the deal to another buyer (or Alice walking away) outweighs the potential for a few dollars more in savings.  Accepting the offer is the most prudent choice at this point."
