Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10200. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,200 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let's split the difference this time."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that we're still a bit apart, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway this time. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. This is a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Although Alice is coming down in price, Bob has only a few rounds left. It's unlikely Alice will go lower enough for him to save a significant amount of money compared to John's price. It's better to secure the product at his desired price point rather than risk a deal falling through."
