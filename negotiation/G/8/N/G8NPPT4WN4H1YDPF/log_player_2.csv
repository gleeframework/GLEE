"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. We have room to negotiate and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Could you do it for $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

We are starting the negotiation significantly lower than Alice's opening offer but leaving us room to negotiate upwards towards a price that works for both of us."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, but $90 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to a price we find acceptable, we can still try to negotiate a little further. We are aiming to get the price as close to $90 as possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice. How about $95?  That's a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

We are nudging the price closer to our target while still acknowledging Alice's attempts to find a middle ground. This offer is close to the midpoint between our last offer and her counteroffer, signaling that we are willing to compromise but still want a good deal."
