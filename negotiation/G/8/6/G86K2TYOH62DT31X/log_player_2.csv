"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think would be perfect for you. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm offering it to you at a very competitive price.  I'm asking for $9,500. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below what you'd be willing to pay and well above what I'd sell it to someone else for.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Bob's goal is to save money.**  Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's, it's still higher than Bob's maximum value for the product.
* **Rejecting allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, Bob opens the possibility of Alice lowering her price further to make a deal."
