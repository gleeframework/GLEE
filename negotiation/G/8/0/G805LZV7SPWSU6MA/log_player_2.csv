"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you.  I'm asking for $10,000, which reflects its true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

``` 

While $10,000 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price. Alice is starting high, and you have the fallback option of buying from John for $12,000. By rejecting this offer, you encourage Alice to come down in price."
