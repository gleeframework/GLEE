"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to reject Alice's offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  $12,000 is over your budget, and you can potentially get the product for cheaper."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $9,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within the range of what I'm willing to pay.  We'll see if she's willing to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's counteroffer is still above my budget.  Since John is willing to sell for $10,000, it makes more sense to buy from him and avoid further negotiation."
