I understand your perspective on the price, but this product holds significant value, and I need to recoup a reasonable amount.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1,200,000?

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's higher than what John is offering and still above my minimum value.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and this is a good compromise."
