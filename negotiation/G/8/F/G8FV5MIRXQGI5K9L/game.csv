"Bob, I have a truly unique product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm asking for $1500000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $900000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I understand your perspective on the price, but this product holds significant value, and I need to recoup a reasonable amount.  How about we split the difference and meet at $1200000? This would still give you a good deal, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable paying $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900000 and $1200000, so I'll offer $1050000. Can you consider this offer?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
