Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its true value."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since Bob values the product at $15,000, there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($10,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $14,000 leaves a small buffer for potential counter-offers from Bob while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong but Fair:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, justifying the price while maintaining a collaborative tone.

By starting high but leaving room for negotiation, Alice maximizes her chances of getting the best possible price from Bob."
