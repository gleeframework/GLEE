Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer. While $100 is better than nothing, I can likely do better by continuing negotiations or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see it in action. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While I'm running out of rounds, I'm not willing to settle for $100. I can still get a better price by continuing to negotiate or by selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm going to make one last offer at $105. This is a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to go lower.  If you reject this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 105}
