,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is simply too low. The product is worth more than that, and I'm sure you'll agree once you see it in action. How about $110? It's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your response, Alice. While I understand the value of your product, I would like to stick to my original offer of $100. I believe this is a fair price given my budget constraints.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to get the feeling we're not going to be able to agree on a price. I'm going to make one last offer at $105. This is a fair compromise, and I'm not willing to go lower.  If you reject this, I'm going to have to move on to another buyer.",105.0,Alice,5,
