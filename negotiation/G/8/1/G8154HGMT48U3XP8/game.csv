"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $925,000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $1,075,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
