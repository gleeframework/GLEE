"Alice, your product is great but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $8,500 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit to meet you halfway. How about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you want a fair price, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you at $8,750, which is a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair.  $8,750 is closer, but it's still a bit below where I need to be.  To make this work, I'm willing to come down to $9,250. This is a significant compromise from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer.  I'm prepared to go up to $8,900, which is a significant increase from my last offer.  This is my final offer, let's get this deal done.",8900.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $8,900 is closer, it's still a bit too far off for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $9,100. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",9100.0,Alice,7,
