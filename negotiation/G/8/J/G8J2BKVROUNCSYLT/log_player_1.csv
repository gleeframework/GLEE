"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a good starting point because it's higher than my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) but leaves room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is still a good deal and I'm not sure if I can get a better price with further negotiation.  The risk of going through more rounds and potentially ending up with John's offer of $8,000 isn't worth it to me."
