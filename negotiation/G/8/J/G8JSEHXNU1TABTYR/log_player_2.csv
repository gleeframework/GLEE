You're still better off trying to negotiate with Alice. There's a chance she might be willing to come down a bit further, and you can still get a better price than from John."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to your desired price, you only have three rounds left. It's unlikely you'll be able to get her lower than $9,550 in that time. Buying from John guarantees you the product at your maximum price."
