"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $60 for it.  What do you think?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. How about we meet in the middle at $90? It's a fair price for a unique product like this.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for countering Alice. I understand the product is special, but $90 is still a bit more than I hoped to spend. Could you do $75? That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $75 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $85? It's a fair price for a product like this, and I'm willing to make a deal.",85.0,Alice,5,
