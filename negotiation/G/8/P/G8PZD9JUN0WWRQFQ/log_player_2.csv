"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since the product is worth no more than $8,000 to you, accepting Alice's offer of $9,500 is not a good option. Buying from John for $8,000 is the best option if you cannot negotiate a lower price with Alice. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and attempting to negotiate a lower price is the best immediate action."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

``` 
While Alice's offer of $8,200 is closer to your limit, it's still above your target.  It's worth trying to negotiate further."
