(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price.  There's a good chance Alice will be willing to come down a bit to secure the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best possible price.  He's offering $1,250,000, which is halfway between his maximum price and Alice's minimum price. This shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a significant saving."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,350,000 is still within Bob's budget and represents a significant saving compared to buying from John. While further negotiation is possible, the risk of Alice walking away or continuing to haggle for too long is a consideration. Accepting the offer secures the product at a reasonable price and avoids potential delays."
