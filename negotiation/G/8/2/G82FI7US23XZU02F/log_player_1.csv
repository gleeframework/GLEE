"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1100000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,100,000 is still less than what I want, and I think I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to $1,150,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000?  It's a fair compromise and still leaves room for both of us to be happy."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $1100000, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Can you consider my offer again? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

At this point, Bob is unwilling to budge much further.  While $1,100,000 is a decent amount of money, it's not worth the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with nothing.  John is a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000, and it's time to take the sure thing."
