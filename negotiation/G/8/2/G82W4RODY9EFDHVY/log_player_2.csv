"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and a significant profit for me. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum value ($1,500,000).**  You need to negotiate a lower price. 
* **There's potential for a better deal.** You can counteroffer and try to get the price down closer to Alice's value ($1,200,000).
* **Buying from John is not a good option.**  He's selling at your maximum, so you'd get no savings."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000, which is still a good deal for both of us. Let's split the difference and make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your budget ($1,350,000).** 
* **It's a good deal for both of you.** Alice is getting a profit, and you're saving money compared to buying from John. 
* **Further negotiation might be possible, but it's not worth the risk.**  You could potentially get a lower price, but you could also risk losing the deal altogether."
