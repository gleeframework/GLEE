"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe aligns perfectly with your needs and expectations. Given its exceptional value and quality, it is worth $1,500,000 to you. I am offering this remarkable opportunity to you at a special price of $1,350,000. This offer is designed to provide you with an attractive savings of $150,000 compared to its market value, while ensuring a fair return on my investment. I trust that you will find this proposal compelling and look forward to discussing the details further with you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is overpriced:** While she claims the product is worth $1,500,000 to you, your maximum valuation is less ($1,500,000 or less).
* **John provides a fallback:** You have the option to buy from John at your maximum price limit. 
* **Negotiation potential:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that her price is too high. This might lead her to propose a better deal closer to her own valuation of $1,200,000. 

By rejecting the offer, you keep the door open for a better deal without risking losing the product entirely."
