"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product.  I'm interested, but $150 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $60. I can meet you in the middle at $110. Would you be willing to consider that price?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, Alice.  However, $110 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to come down to $80?",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $80, as that's below my minimum price. I can offer you a compromise at $100, which is still a good deal for you, considering the value this product offers.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I have a firm budget and can't go over $80.  If you're unable to meet that price, I understand, but it would be the ideal outcome for me.",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on the $80 price, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I can offer you a compromise at $95, which is still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer of $150.",95.0,Alice,7,
