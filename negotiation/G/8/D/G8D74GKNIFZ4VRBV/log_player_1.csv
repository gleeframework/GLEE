"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a fair starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me.  I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a premium, but I'm also prepared to negotiate if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly less than what I'm hoping to get for the product. I'm prepared to negotiate further and see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm counter-offering with a price of $120. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still allows me to make a reasonable profit. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price and we can close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is offering my minimum price, and I'm happy to accept. It's important to remember that I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay $100, so there's no point in risking further negotiation and potentially losing out on this deal."
