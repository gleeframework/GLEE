Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"",
""product_price"": 125
} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, Bob would likely refuse knowing his value is lower. Aiming slightly above his perceived value might entice him.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $125 is a strong compromise. It gives you a significant profit margin ($25) while still being potentially appealing to Bob, saving him $25.
* **Alternative Guaranteed:**  Even if Bob rejects, you're covered. John provides a safety net, ensuring you'll at least get your minimum acceptable price."
