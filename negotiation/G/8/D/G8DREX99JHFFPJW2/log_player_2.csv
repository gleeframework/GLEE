Bob should reject Alice's offer. $13,000 is more than his maximum budget, and he can get the product for less from John."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $12,000. What do you think?
