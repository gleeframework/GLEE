Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and potential.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still thinking more along the lines of $1,250,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to be confident that I'm getting a good deal.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is inching closer, we're still significantly above John's offer. There's room to negotiate, and it's unlikely Bob will walk away over $75,000 if he's truly interested."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to anchor the price lower, but his increments are decreasing. We need to signal that we're firm but willing to make smaller concessions.  We're still far enough above John's offer to justify continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this gap. What if we agree on $1,260,000? That's a significant movement on my end and demonstrates my commitment to getting this done."",

Round 8
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely push for a bit more, Bob's offer is now only $60,000 away from our last counter.  The risk of him walking away and the diminishing returns of further negotiation make this a reasonable point to accept. We're securing a $235,000 profit over John's offer."
