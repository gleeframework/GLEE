"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds your maximum budget of $120. You're better off rejecting the offer and going with John, as you're still getting the product within your budget."
