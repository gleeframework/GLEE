"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $920,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot.",920000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $920,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair price for both of us.  Let's reach an agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $875,000 is a good price, but I was thinking more along the lines of $915,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. Let's see if we can find a sweet spot. I'm also keeping in mind that I have another interested buyer who is willing to pay $800,000, so I want to make sure we can reach an agreement soon.",915000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $915,000 is still too high for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $895,000.  This is a good compromise that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's finalize this deal.",895000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $895,000 yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's try $907,500. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. I'm still keeping John's offer in mind, so let's move quickly.",907500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. This is a fair price, and it will allow us to finalize this deal quickly.  Let's avoid going back and forth any further.",900000.0,Bob,8,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and my original offer of $920,000. Let's try $910,000. This is a fair price that should be acceptable to both of us. I'm running out of patience, though, so let's make a decision soon.",910000.0,Alice,9,
