Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below John's price ($119) leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly."
