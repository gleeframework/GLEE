"Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $160 for it. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $160 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to pay $80 right now.  Let me know if that works for you.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $120? That's the lowest I can go.",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $120 is still outside of my budget. How about $100?  That's a fair price for both of us, I think.",100.0,Bob,4,
