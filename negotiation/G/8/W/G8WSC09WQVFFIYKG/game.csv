"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm looking for a serious buyer. I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $1800000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer. What are your thoughts?",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I think the price is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1400000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1400000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1600000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1300000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to me and the market price.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1300000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1500000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I think this is still a fair price considering the product's value to you and the initial price I offered.",1500000.0,Alice,5,
