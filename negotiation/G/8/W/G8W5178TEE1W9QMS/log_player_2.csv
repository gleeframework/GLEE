"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $140. I think it's a great deal for you, given its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $140 is within your budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $120, meaning there's a potential $20 saving opportunity. You can aim for a price closer to $130 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit steep for me. Could you do $125?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:** This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price while still leaving room for further negotiation.  It positions you closer to your target price while acknowledging Alice's initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice meeting you in the middle at $130 is a good compromise. You're saving $10 from her initial offer and $20 from John's price. It's unlikely further negotiation will yield significantly better results."
