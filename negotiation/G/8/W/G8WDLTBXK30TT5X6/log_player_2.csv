"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  I'm willing to negotiate, but I have a backup plan with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $8,000."",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Counter:** Starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price sets the stage for negotiation.  It signals that I'm serious about buying but need her to come down considerably.
* **Strategic Lowball:** While $8,000 is quite a bit lower than my $10,000 maximum, it leaves room for me to move up in subsequent rounds.
* **Time Consideration:** I have multiple rounds, so there's no need to be overly aggressive right away. This gives Alice a chance to counter, and we can hopefully find a middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too High:** While Alice moved towards my initial offer, $13,000 is still above my budget and John's offer.
* **Room to Negotiate:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to settle. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better price. 
* **Aiming for Below $10,000:** Ideally, I want to get Alice to come down below $10,000 so I get a better deal than John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, but $13,000 is still more than I'm comfortable spending.  Could you do $9,500?"", 
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** I'm increasing my offer to show Alice I'm willing to negotiate, but not by much. 
* **Below Budget, Above John:** This offer stays below my $10,000 budget while still leaving me some potential profit margin compared to John's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help me gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be. If she rejects it outright, I may have to concede a bit more in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing you're serious about this product, and I want to make a deal.  However, I need a price that reflects its value.  Let's try $11,500. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer Bluff:** Alice often use ""final offer"" as a negotiation tactic. I don't believe this is truly her final offer.  
* **Still Above Budget:** $11,500 is still more than I'm willing to spend, especially since I have John's offer as a backup.
* **Calculated Risk:** I'm willing to take the risk of losing the deal with Alice by rejecting this offer. I believe she'll be more willing to negotiate in later rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I understand this product is valuable, but I have a budget I need to stick to. I can't justify going higher than $10,000. That's my absolute limit."",
 ""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm setting a firm limit at my maximum budget. This shows Alice I'm serious but also limits my potential losses.
* **Transparency:**  By being open about my budget, I'm hoping to encourage Alice to be more realistic with her expectations.
* **John as Leverage:**  Alice knows I have John's offer. By sticking to $10,000, I'm implicitly telling her that going any lower isn't worth it for me."
