"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value of $10,000, but I believe it's a reasonable starting point.  I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm not willing to sell for $8,000, which is below my minimum value.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000.  This is still a good profit margin for me, but it's closer to Bob's offer, showing some willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping this will entice him to come up a bit."
