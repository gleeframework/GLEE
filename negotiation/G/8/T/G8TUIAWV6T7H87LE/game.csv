"Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your confidence. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I see that you're standing firm at $15,000. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this might be more acceptable to you.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $13,000 is still too low. Let's compromise - I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget.  What do you say?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I believe that a price of $13,500 would be fair for both parties involved. It's slightly above my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion will be considered favorably.",13500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $13,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  I think that's a fair compromise that gives us both something to be happy about. Let's finalize this deal, I'm sure you'll be glad you did.",14250.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully, and I believe a price of $14,000 would be a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product.",14000.0,Bob,8,
