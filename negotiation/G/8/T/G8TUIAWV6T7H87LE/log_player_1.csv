Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth more than that to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 17000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product and appreciate your confidence. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $12,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'd prefer to try and maximize my profit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $12,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down to $15,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the true value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 15000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that you're standing firm at $15,000. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we could reach an agreement closer to my budget. I would like to propose a price of $13,000 for the product. I hope this might be more acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

$13,000 is still lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I have more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get a better price.  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, but I'd prefer to try and maximize my profit.  I'll counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $13,000 is still too low. Let's compromise - I'm willing to drop my price to $14,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while also being within your budget.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. I believe that a price of $13,500 would be fair for both parties involved. It's slightly above my initial offer but still within my budget constraints. I hope this suggestion will be considered favorably. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $13,500 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not enough.  I'm getting closer to my desired price, and I only have a few rounds left. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get Bob to agree to a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm still not quite there at $13,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $14,250?  I think that's a fair compromise that gives us both something to be happy about. Let's finalize this deal, I'm sure you'll be glad you did."", ""product_price"": 14250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've been considering your offers carefully, and I believe a price of $14,000 would be a fair compromise between our positions. I hope this aligns better with your valuation of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is very close to my counteroffer of $14,250. With only two rounds left, I'm confident that I won't be able to get a significantly higher price. Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit, and it's likely that the next round will only lead to further negotiation without a guaranteed outcome."
