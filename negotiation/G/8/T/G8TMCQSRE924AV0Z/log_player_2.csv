{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $75.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate and a fallback option of $100 with John.  Rejecting Alice's offer gives you more leverage to potentially get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a counteroffer of $60 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $75, showing your intent to negotiate. This gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured, while still potentially securing a good deal for you."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $70 is better than $75, it's still higher than your ideal price. You have several rounds remaining and a backup option with John. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to continue negotiating for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a pattern of adjusting her offers slightly. Since her last offer was $72, a counteroffer of $68 shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price. This also gives Alice room to counter without feeling pressured. You are nearing the middle ground and with 4 rounds left, the pressure is starting to shift a bit towards Alice."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $74 is higher than your previous counteroffer of $68. Although you are nearing the middle ground and time is running out, you still have 3 rounds left and a backup option with John.  Rejecting Alice's offer keeps you in the negotiation game."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 70} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a pattern of adjusting her offers, and with only 3 rounds left, you need to start moving closer to a possible deal.  A counteroffer of $70 is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing your willingness to compromise. It also puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or risk losing the deal.  If she rejects, you will have one more round to negotiate before you need to make a decision about John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $76. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $76
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $76 is higher than your previous counteroffer of $70.  With only one round left, it is unlikely that she will budge further.  While you could make one last counteroffer, it is likely to be rejected, leaving you with no deal and having to buy from John.  It's better to save time and avoid further negotiation by accepting John's offer of $100.  While not your ideal price, it's the best option at this stage."
