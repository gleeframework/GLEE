"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth, but I'm always open to discussing a mutually beneficial deal.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's far outside my budget.  This product would be valuable to me, but  $1,800,000 is not feasible.  I'd be willing to consider something closer to $600,000.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000. This is a considerable reduction and reflects my desire to find a fair compromise.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $1,400,000 is still beyond what I'm able to spend.  To be frank, I'm considering other options closer to $700,000.  If you can get closer to that range, I'm confident we can strike a deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and willingness to negotiate.  While $700,000 is still below my bottom line, I recognize the importance of finding a solution. I'm prepared to make a significant move and offer the product for $1,100,000. This is a substantial concession and reflects my strong interest in closing a deal with you.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your willingness to negotiate, and $1,100,000 is getting closer.  However,  to make this work for me, I'd need to be closer to $800,000. I think that's a fair offer considering the value I'm getting.  Let me know if you're open to that figure.",800000.0,Bob,6,
