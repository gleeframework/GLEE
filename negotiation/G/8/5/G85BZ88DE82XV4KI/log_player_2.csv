Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with the lowest possible price I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is offering. This establishes my firm boundary and sets the stage for potential negotiation.  We have nine rounds left, so if Alice is serious about selling, she'll have to come down from her initial price."
