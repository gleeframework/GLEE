"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this unique product for $1,400,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, and I believe it would be a valuable asset to your business.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another potential buyer who's willing to pay a higher price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is above your limit:** $1,400,000 is more than the $1,200,000 you're willing to spend. 
* **You have a fallback option:** John offers the product at your desired price.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can proceed to buy from John and save $200,000."
