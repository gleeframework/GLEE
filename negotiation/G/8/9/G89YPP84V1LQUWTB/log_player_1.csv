Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 but leaves room for negotiation. It also ensures that I'm getting a good price for the product while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm counter-offering Bob at $975,000. This is a compromise that shows I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves some room for potential profit.  It also ensures that I'm getting closer to my target price without risking losing the deal to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Bob's offer is very close to my desired price.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $975,000, the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal to John outweighs the benefit of trying to squeeze out a few extra thousand dollars.  I'm going to accept Bob's offer."
