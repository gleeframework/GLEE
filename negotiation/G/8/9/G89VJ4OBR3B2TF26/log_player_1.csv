"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

I'm starting high, aiming for my ideal price.  This will set the tone and let Bob know I'm serious about getting a good deal.  If he rejects, I can adjust my offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. While it's tempting to accept given the risk of losing him, it's still significantly below my minimum value. I'll counteroffer to try and find a middle ground before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit from my initial asking price, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum value. This shows flexibility while also demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum value, it's still not enough. It's risky, but I'm going to keep negotiating and see if I can reach a more favorable price. I have 6 rounds left, and John is still an option if this doesn't work out."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm continuing to be flexible but firm. I'm lowering the price again, but it's still a significant profit for me.  This is a compromise that could potentially get Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $980,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $980,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better deal. While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I have 4 rounds left.  There's still room to negotiate, and I'm not ready to settle for something that doesn't feel fair."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1020000} 
```

I'm coming down a bit more, acknowledging Bob's increased willingness to pay.  This is a significant compromise, but I'm hoping to close the deal before I run out of rounds. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I've reached a critical point. We're down to our last two rounds and I'm getting closer to my minimum value. However, Bob is still only offering $990,000. I'm confident I can get closer to my ideal price with John, and I'm not willing to risk losing the deal with him.  It's time to move on and sell to John."
