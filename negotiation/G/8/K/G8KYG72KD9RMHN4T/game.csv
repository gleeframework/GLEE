"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this amazing product to you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to make a fair offer of $1,200,000. I think this is a great starting point, and I'm open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has a lot of potential, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me right now.  How about we bring the price down to $800,000 and go from there?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,000,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
