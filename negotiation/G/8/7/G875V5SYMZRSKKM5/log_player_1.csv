Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on the price. I can do $100, but that's my absolute limit. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100.

**Reasoning:**  Bob has reached his maximum price and is unlikely to go any higher.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than to continue haggling with Bob and risk getting less."
