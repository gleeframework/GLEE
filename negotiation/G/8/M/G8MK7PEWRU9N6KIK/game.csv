"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,050,000? It's a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $1,025,000?",1025000.0,Bob,4,
