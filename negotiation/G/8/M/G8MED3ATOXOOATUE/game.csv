"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $900,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, especially considering its long-term potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This offer reflects its real worth.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be upfront -  $950,000 is simply too low for a product of this caliber.  I'm willing to make one final concession to show my commitment to this deal. Let's settle at $1,000,000 even.  This is my absolute best offer.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your concession, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $1,000,000, which is $975,000. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product if we can meet at this price.",975000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close, but I need you to understand the value of this product.  My final offer is $990,000.  This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer, as I have other potential buyers.",990000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $990,000. I'm willing to meet you at $980,000, but I think I can do better than that. I'm willing to go up to $985,000, but no further. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and the potential return on investment.",985000.0,Bob,8,
