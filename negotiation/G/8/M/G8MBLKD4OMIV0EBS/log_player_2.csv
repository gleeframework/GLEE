"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is lower than the price John is offering ($1,500,000).  This means accepting Alice's offer saves Bob $100,000.  Even though Bob values the product at $1,500,000, he's still able to get a good deal by accepting Alice's offer."
