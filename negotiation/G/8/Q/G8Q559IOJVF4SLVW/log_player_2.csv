# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product, which I believe will greatly benefit your needs and expectations. Given its high value to you, I propose a price of $10,000 to ensure it's within your budget while maximizing my return on investment. If you're interested, we can proceed with the transaction right away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer ($10,000) is lower than your maximum budget ($12,000).**  This means you're saving money compared to buying from John.
* **You are still getting a good deal.** The product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so you are paying $2,000 more than its value to her.  This is a reasonable profit margin for Alice and a good price for you."
