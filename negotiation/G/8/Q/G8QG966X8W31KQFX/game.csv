"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000.  It's a substantial investment, but I believe its value to you will far exceed the price. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
