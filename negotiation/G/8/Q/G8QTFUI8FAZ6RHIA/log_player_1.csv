Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you a chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find this offer compelling. I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $1,100,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a substantial profit above your minimum ($800,000).
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** This price indicates you understand the product's value to Bob without seeming overly aggressive or leaving too much money on the table. 
 
**Important:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or potential willingness to pay. If you had more insights into Bob, you could adjust your offer accordingly."
