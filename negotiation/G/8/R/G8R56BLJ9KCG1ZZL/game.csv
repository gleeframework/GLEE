"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $105, which is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to my original price. Let me know if that works for you!",105.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. I'm still a bit tight on budget.  How about $100? That's fair for both of us, and I can get it from you without having to go elsewhere. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,4,
