"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great deal for you at a price of $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have room to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still above her valuation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:**  A low counteroffer helps us understand how much she's willing to budge.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Even if she rejects this offer, we have space to meet in the middle over the next few rounds. 

By starting lower, we increase our chances of getting a better deal in the long run."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $130. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice met us halfway, the new offer of $130 is still above our ideal price range. We know she's willing to negotiate, so we'll continue the process by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $115?"",
""product_price"": 115
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly from $110 to $115 to show Alice we're willing to move towards a compromise.
* **Staying below the midpoint:** This offer keeps the price below the midpoint between our initial offer ($110) and her counteroffer ($130), aiming for a final price closer to our target.
* **Still room for negotiation:** This offer leaves some space for further negotiation if Alice is not yet ready to accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $125. I'm willing to make another concession, though. I can offer it to you for $125. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $125, which is a reasonable price and within our acceptable range (below $150). It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. Accepting at this point secures us a good price."
