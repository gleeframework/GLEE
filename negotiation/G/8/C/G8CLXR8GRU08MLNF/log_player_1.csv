Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

This offer is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), but it leaves some room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn a larger sum than John's offer. I'm aiming to find a middle ground where Bob sees value in purchasing while I still achieve a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to secure a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

I'm lowering my price from $1,400,000 to $1,300,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still keeping the price above Bob's initial offer.  My hope is to find a compromise that is mutually beneficial."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'm still hoping for a better deal, Bob's offer is getting too close to his initial valuation ($1,000,000).  There's a high risk of further negotiation leading to a final price that is too low.  It's time to cut my losses and secure the guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000."
