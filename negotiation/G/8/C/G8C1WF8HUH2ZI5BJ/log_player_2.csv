Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Since the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's maximum price, but it's still higher than what he wants to pay. There are still a few rounds left, and Bob can continue to negotiate. By rejecting the offer, Bob can continue to push for a lower price. There's still potential for a good deal if both parties continue to compromise."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to Alice's last offer. This counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a lower price.  With only a few rounds left, Bob needs to strike a balance between getting a good deal and avoiding a potential stalemate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting dangerously close to Bob's maximum price. There's only one round left, and it's highly unlikely that Alice will budge much further. While it's still possible to try and negotiate a lower price, the risk of a stalemate or a last-minute rejection is too high.  Buying from John ensures that Bob gets the product within his budget, even if it's not the absolute lowest price possible."
