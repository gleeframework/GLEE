"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase my product.  Given its value and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $20,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product, reflecting its value to me. I believe this is a fair price, considering the benefits it offers. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $20,000 reflects the true value of this product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $17,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $17,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $13,000. It's a fair price that reflects the value I place on the product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $13,000 significantly undervalues the product and the benefits it brings.  I'm willing to consider a price of $15,500, which is my final offer. This is a very reasonable compromise considering its true worth.",15500.0,Alice,5,
