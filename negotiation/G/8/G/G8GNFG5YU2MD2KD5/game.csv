"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $900000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1100000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit above my budget, so I'd like to make another counteroffer. I'm willing to pay $950000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the value it would bring to me, and I hope you can consider it.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're still trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $1050000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to make one more concession, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable going above $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, so I'm making a counteroffer of $1025000. I hope this is something we can agree on.",1025000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1025000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm offering the product to you for $1100000. This is my final offer, and I hope you can see the value in the product and make a decision.",1100000.0,Alice,7,
