{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer aims to:

* **Maximize profit:** $1,000,000 is a good starting point, significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** It gives Bob some room to counter-offer, keeping the negotiation open.
* **Be friendly:** Maintaining a positive tone can encourage Bob to be more cooperative.

**Important Note:**  The negotiation strategy should be adapted based on Bob's reaction and any information available about his negotiation style."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1000000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'm willing to negotiate further, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I understand your position.  While $850,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to compromise.  Let's meet in the middle at $925,000. This reflects the significant value this product holds for you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 925000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer shows I'm willing to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Value proposition:** I reiterate the value the product holds for Bob.
* **Maintain positive tone:** A friendly tone encourages further negotiation.

This counteroffer aims to secure a price that's closer to my desired profit margin while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $925000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $900000?  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and allows you to make a solid profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is very close to my desired price and significantly better than selling to John for $800,000.  While I could continue to negotiate, the risk of losing the deal altogether is high.  Accepting Bob's offer secures a good profit and ensures a sale."
