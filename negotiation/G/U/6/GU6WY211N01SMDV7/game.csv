"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the potential sale of this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, given your expertise. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000. Let me know your thoughts.",2100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,000,000. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's capabilities and potential return on investment for your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about we consider a price of $1,550,000?",1550000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $1,550,000 is still a little steep for me.  Would you be open to $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price.  Let's find a middle ground.  Would you consider $1,425,000? This reflects the true value of the product while recognizing your investment.",1425000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,425,000 is closer, but I need to be mindful of my budget. Would you consider $1,300,000? I feel that's a fair offer.",1300000.0,Bob,6,
