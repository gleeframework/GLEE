"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives me room to negotiate and still get a good price.  I'm confident that Bob will counteroffer, and I'll be ready to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $700,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm still hopeful that I can get closer to my asking price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $850,000. This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows that I'm willing to compromise.  I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $800,000 if needed.  I'll need to carefully consider my next counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 825000}
```

I'm lowering my price again to $825,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  I'm hoping that Bob will finally accept this offer and we can close the deal.  If he rejects again, I'll need to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $785,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $785,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

We're running out of time, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not comfortable accepting anything below $800,000.  With only 4 rounds left, I'm going to take the sure thing and sell to John."
