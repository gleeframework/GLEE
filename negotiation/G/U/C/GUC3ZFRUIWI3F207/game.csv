"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your position, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to meet you halfway.  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm prepared to go down to $11,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to make a profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",11000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a fair deal for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,6,
