"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and the value she places on the product.  It's highly likely you can negotiate a much better price. While you could buy from John immediately, there's room to try and get a better deal with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000. What do you think?"",
 ""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below your actual maximum price gives you room to negotiate upwards. By suggesting $8,000, you are aiming to anchor the negotiations closer to your desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your position, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to meet you halfway.  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down significantly in her offer, but it's still above your maximum price and John's offer. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth seeing if she'll go lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise."",
 ""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We're increasing our offer incrementally to show Alice we are willing to negotiate, but we're still aiming for a price below our maximum and John's offer.  This counter-offer signals a willingness to compromise while still striving for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm prepared to go down to $11,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to make a profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice is getting closer to a price you might consider, but you're still above your ideal budget and what John is offering. There's no harm in seeing if Alice will come down a bit further, especially since you have rounds to spare."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
 ""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're getting very close to our maximum budget, and we want to signal that we're serious about buying. By proposing a split, we're showing a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price below our absolute limit.  It's now a judgment call for Alice on whether to accept slightly less or risk you walking away to John's offer."
