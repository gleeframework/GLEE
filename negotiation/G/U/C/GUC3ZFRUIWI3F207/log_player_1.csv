"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate down while still securing a good profit.  I'm hoping to gauge his interest and start the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell for that price.  I'll counter with a higher price, but one that's still lower than my minimum.  I'm hoping to find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $8,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I understand your position, but I'm willing to come down to $12,000 to meet you halfway.  This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good deal.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit too much for my budget. How about $9,500? That's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not willing to sell for that price. I'm going to counter with a price closer to $12,000 and see if we can reach a compromise.  I'm not yet desperate enough to sell to John, as I believe there's still a good chance of getting a higher price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still below what I need to make this work. I'm prepared to go down to $11,000,  which is a fair compromise for both of us. This allows you to get a good deal, and me to make a profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference and settle at $10,500? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's not my ideal price, it's above my minimum, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  It's unlikely that I'll get a higher price from Bob, and I'm starting to run out of rounds. It's a good deal for both of us and allows me to close the deal without having to sell to John."
