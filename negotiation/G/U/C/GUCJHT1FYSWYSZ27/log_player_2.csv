"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's worth at least $8,000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.  It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $10,000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Alice's offer is tempting, you know you can get the product for $10,000 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in further negotiations."
