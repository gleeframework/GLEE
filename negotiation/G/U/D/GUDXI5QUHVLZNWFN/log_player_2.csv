"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I believe it's worth every penny for you. Let me know what you think!

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your target price.** You want to buy the product for under $10,000, and Alice's offer is $9,500. 
* **You have room for negotiation.** You can make a counteroffer to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is a backup option.**  You're not in a rush, so you can keep negotiating with Alice. If you don't get a satisfactory price, you can always buy from John."

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach a deal!"", ""product_price"": 8500}

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and it gives me some room to make a profit. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

* **You can still negotiate.** You have room to get a better price. There are still rounds left, and you're not in a rush to buy.
