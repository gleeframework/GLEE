{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase [product name] before I open it up to other buyers.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $1,350,000.  I believe this price reflects a fair deal for both of us considering the potential benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:**  You don't want to just throw out a number. Mentioning ""unique value proposition"" and ""potential benefits"" subtly implies the product is worth the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  The price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he's interested, allowing you to potentially secure a deal above your guaranteed price. 
* **Polite and Professional:** The tone is positive and respectful, encouraging a good business interaction even if Bob ultimately declines."
