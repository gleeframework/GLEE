"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $95 is still too high for Bob. It's worth rejecting the offer and seeing if Alice will come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is aiming to get the price down as much as possible while still leaving some room for negotiation. Offering $85 is a reasonable starting point, as it's below Alice's value of $80 but still leaves some room for Alice to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $90 is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than the $85 he offered in the previous round.  Bob can try to push for a lower price by rejecting and making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about buying the product. $87 is a compromise, closer to Alice's value but still leaving some room for her to make a profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's current target price. It's worth rejecting and trying to get closer to $87. There are still rounds left, so there's potential for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 89}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. $89 is a good compromise, closer to Alice's value of $80 but still below Bob's maximum price of $100. This offer shows that Bob is willing to negotiate but also wants to ensure he gets a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $91. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $91
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $91 is still above Bob's ideal price, it's getting closer to his target and is below the $100 he'd pay for the product from John. With only a few rounds left, it's likely Alice won't lower the price further, so Bob is better off accepting the offer and securing the purchase."
