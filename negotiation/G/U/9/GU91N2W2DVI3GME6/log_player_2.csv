Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob. I appreciate your offer. To further align with your budget, I propose a revised price of $925,000 for the product. This still maintains a significant value proposition while addressing your financial considerations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is steadily coming down in price, but we're still a ways off from John's guaranteed $1,000,000 price. There's room to negotiate further, and it's unlikely Alice will walk away from a deal this close to her bottom line."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I feel like we're getting closer. To bridge the remaining gap, I'm willing to increase my offer to $900,000.  I believe this is a strong offer that reflects the product's value to me while respecting your position."",
""product_price"": 900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but in smaller increments to show we're serious while maintaining negotiating leverage.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  By round 6, implying we're nearing a decision adds a subtle pressure without being aggressive.
* **Fairness Emphasis:**  We're still below John's price, so emphasizing ""fairness"" keeps the tone positive while aiming for a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your effort to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the product's unique features and the benefits it provides, I would like to propose a final price of $950,000. This still maintains a reasonable profit margin for us while being competitive with your valuation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has gone back up to her previous offer of $950,000. This suggests she's reached her negotiation limit and is unlikely to budge further.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  We're now at round 7, and further negotiation risks exceeding our $1,000,000 alternative with John. 
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John provides a safe fallback option. Even if we could squeeze a slightly lower price from Alice, the risk and time investment are no longer worthwhile."
