"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives me a reasonable profit, and it's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if you're willing to meet me halfway.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105, which is the lowest I can go. Can you meet me at this price?",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I respect that.  However, $105 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you at $108. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. Let's close this deal!",108.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $108. I'm willing to pay $105, and I think that's a fair price considering the product's value. Can you meet me at this price?",105.0,Bob,6,
