Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000, which is my absolute maximum. I believe this price is fair given the market value and our previous discussions. If you're not willing to accept this offer, I'll unfortunately have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $1,200,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great value for the product's worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
