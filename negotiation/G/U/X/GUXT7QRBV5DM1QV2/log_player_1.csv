Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value while still allowing for a healthy profit for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
