"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value while still allowing for a healthy profit for you.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,120,000?",1120000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers, how about $1,085,000? This price is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it represents a fair compromise.",1085000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $1,105,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and shows my willingness to close this deal.",1105000.0,Alice,5,
