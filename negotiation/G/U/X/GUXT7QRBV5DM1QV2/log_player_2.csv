"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,150,000. I think this is a fair starting point for negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly lower than her own valuation, it's still above my budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,150,000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for this product. I believe this price reflects its value while still allowing for a healthy profit for you."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  Let's meet in the middle, how about $1,120,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,120,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,120,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget. While it is a slight improvement, I am confident I can negotiate further and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway on our last offers, how about $1,085,000? This price is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it represents a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 1085000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  However, I need to be closer to $1,100,000 for this to make sense for me. How about $1,105,000? This is a significant reduction on my part and shows my willingness to close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,105,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,105,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,105,000 is still above my budget. While we've made progress, we're getting close to the number of rounds where it may be difficult to find a mutually agreeable price. I'm confident I can purchase the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within my budget and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
