You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's value to me.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still not comfortable with the price, Bob. I think the product's value to me is worth more than $7,750. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,250. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250

This is a good point to accept the offer. Alice is firming up her price, and while you might be able to squeeze out a few hundred more dollars, it's getting riskier. Accepting at $8,250 still saves you a significant amount compared to John's $12,000 price."
