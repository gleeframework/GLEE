"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your offer of $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and be well worth the investment.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $10,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $9,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",9000.0,Bob,4,
