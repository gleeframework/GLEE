{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really enjoy! I'm asking for $140 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum price of $120 but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to counteroffer.  This strategy aims to maximize your earnings while still leaving room for a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to go down to $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $130 is a decent price, it's still below the $140 you initially offered.  You're willing to negotiate further to see if you can reach a price closer to your target. You're confident you can get a better deal by countering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and go with $135?  That's still a great price for this product, and it's fair to both of us."", ""product_price"": 135}
```"
