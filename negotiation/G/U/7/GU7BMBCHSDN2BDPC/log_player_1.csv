We're getting closer, but $16,500 is still below my minimum. I'll try to nudge him a bit higher in the next round."

Bob is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll make one more counteroffer to see if I can get closer to $17,000."

}

While it's less than I hoped for, accepting Bob's offer at $16,200 is the best decision at this point.  Here's why:

* **Time is a factor:**  We're running out of rounds, and there's no guarantee Bob will go any higher. 
* **Minimal loss:** Accepting $16,200 is only a $800 difference from my last offer and a much better deal than selling to John for $15,000.
* **Relationship building:** Accepting might lead to a positive business relationship with Bob in the future."
