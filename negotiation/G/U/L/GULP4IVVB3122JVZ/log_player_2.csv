"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the substantial benefits you'll reap from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,150,000 is a good starting point, it's still above his ideal price. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and a backup option with John. It's beneficial to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product, given its value to me.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is a significant drop from my initial asking price.  This product offers tremendous value, and I believe $1,100,000 is a fair compromise that reflects its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save money and is aware of the backup option with John. Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is closer to Bob's ideal price, but he can likely still get a better deal by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and potentially allows Bob to secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my comfort zone.  I'm willing to pay $1,075,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement within this range."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,090,000. I believe this price point reflects the value proposition while acknowledging your perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,090,000 is within Bob's budget and is only $40,000 above his last counteroffer.  Given that there are only 5 rounds left and Bob's backup option with John is $1,200,000, it's  in Bob's best interest to accept this offer to secure the product at a reasonable price. Continuing to negotiate carries the risk of the deal falling through and Bob having to pay a higher price from John."
