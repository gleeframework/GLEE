Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price closer to Bob's perceived value ($150) than my minimum ($100). This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The $130 offer signals that I'm open to negotiation, but not desperate to sell at a low price.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Knowing I have John as a backup buyer at $100 gives me leverage. I won't accept any offers below that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product. I would like to propose a price of $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is my absolute minimum. I know he values the product at $150, so there's room to negotiate a better price. I'll counter-offer to see if I can reach a more favorable outcome before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not accepting it outright. Splitting the difference between his last offer ($100) and my previous offer ($130) is a common negotiation tactic.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  By countering, I'm showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but not willing to give in completely. 
* **Backup Plan:**  I still have the option to sell to John for $100 if Bob remains unreasonable, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $105 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:** Bob's offer of $105 is more than my minimum acceptable price ($100) and provides a reasonable profit. 
* **Diminishing Returns:**  Continuing to negotiate might only yield small increments above $105. It's not worth the risk of losing Bob entirely. 
* **Time Value:**  Reaching a deal now means I secure the sale and avoid potentially lengthy negotiations."
