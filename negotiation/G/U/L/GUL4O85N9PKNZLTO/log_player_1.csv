Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. It's in excellent condition and I believe it would be a great investment for you. I'm offering it to you for $100."",
""product_price"": 100
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($120) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $100 leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, potentially allowing you to earn even more. 
* **Above Minimum:** $100 ensures a profit above your minimum acceptable price ($80).

This strategy aims for a win-win situation: Bob gets a product he values for a good price, and you maximize your earnings."
