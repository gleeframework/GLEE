Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a great deal for me.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

I'll reject Bob's offer.  $1,050,000 is too low for me, and I still have 8 rounds to work with.  I'm confident I can get a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fantastic price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 1100000}

Round 4

I'm still confident I can get a better price.  While $1,075,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle yet.  I have 6 more rounds to work with."
