"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,150,000. It's a steal considering its value to you! I'm confident we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While the price is below Bob's maximum, it's still higher than Alice's minimum. There's room for negotiation to potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $1,050,000?  That's still a good profit for you, and a great deal for me."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,050,000 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which is still a fantastic price for a product worth $1,200,000 to you. Let's meet in the middle! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a better price than the first round, there's still room to negotiate.  Bob's counteroffer in round 2 showed his willingness to pay around $1,050,000, and Alice's counteroffer is only $50,000 closer to his goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I'm still aiming for a lower price.  Let's split the difference and go with $1,075,000.  This is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1075000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you. I'm willing to come down a little more to $1,090,000.  This is a fair price for both of us. It's a significant discount from my initial offer, and still a great deal for you considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,090,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,090,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While it's not his ideal price, it's a fair deal.  He's already shown his willingness to pay around $1,075,000, and Alice is now only $15,000 above that.  It's unlikely he'll get a significantly lower price, and he risks losing the deal altogether by continuing to reject offers."
