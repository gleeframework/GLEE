"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great opportunity to get your hands on a high-quality product at a competitive price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can get the product for $10,000 from John, so there's no reason to pay more.  The next step is to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,750. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John. Alice's offer is still higher than what John is offering, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will result in a lower price from Alice. It's better to secure the product for a price he's comfortable with."
