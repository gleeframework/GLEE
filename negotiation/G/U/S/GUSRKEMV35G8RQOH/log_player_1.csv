Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That price is a little too high for me, how about $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
 ""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $70 is quite a bit lower than I'm hoping for.  Would you consider $130?"",
 ""product_price"": 130
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you meeting me closer to the middle, but $130 is still a bit much for me.  How about $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 
 
While I could counter again, getting $90 is a reasonable outcome at this point. Bob is unlikely to go much higher, and I'd rather secure the deal now than risk him walking away."
