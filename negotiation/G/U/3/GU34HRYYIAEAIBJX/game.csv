"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work.",11500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this.",12500.0,Alice,3,
