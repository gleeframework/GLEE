{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal and I know you'll appreciate its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, acknowledging the product's value to both of us.  This allows for negotiation and gives Bob a sense of getting a deal. I'm also keeping John in mind as a backup option, giving me some leverage during the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $11,500. Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is close to my minimum, I'm not ready to sell yet. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $11,500 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,500.  This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can agree on this."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still not quite there, but I'm willing to go up to $12,200.  Let's split the difference and finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,200 is very close to my minimum of $12,000, and it's higher than what John is offering. This is a good deal for me, and I'd rather sell it to Bob and get a little bit more."
