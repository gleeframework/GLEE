Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its significant value.  My initial offer is $1,400,000. This price allows for some flexibility, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the flexibility you're showing, but I'm looking to get this product at a price closer to $1200000.  I'm willing to offer you $1250000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $1,250,000 is better than Bob's initial valuation, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to Alice.  She wants to maximize her profit, and selling to John guarantees her the minimum she's willing to accept.  

However, she's not giving up on Bob yet. Alice will counteroffer in the next round, aiming to get closer to her desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,250,000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering $1,350,000. This represents a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is getting closer, but Alice is still aiming for a higher price. She's not quite ready to accept, but wants to continue negotiating. She sees the potential to get a better price and feels she can still influence Bob with some strategic counteroffers."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer. $1,300,000 is still a bit below what I need to ensure a worthwhile deal for me.  Let's split the difference.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product. However, $1325000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1280000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,280,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,280,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to Alice's minimum, it's still significantly less than what she could get from John. She's not ready to close the deal yet, and she still believes she can convince Bob to pay a higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. $1,280,000 is still not quite enough for me to consider closing this deal.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway on our last offers.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1290000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

The time is running out and Bob's offer is still below what Alice considers a fair price.  She's also reached a point where she feels she's done all she can to negotiate with Bob.  With only a few rounds left, the risk of not closing a deal with Bob is too high.  Selling to John guarantees her the minimum she's willing to accept and avoids the risk of losing a better deal altogether."
