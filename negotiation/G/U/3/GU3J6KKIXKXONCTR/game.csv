"Bob, I'm happy to offer you this product at a price that reflects its significant value.  My initial offer is $1400000. This price allows for some flexibility, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the flexibility you're showing, but I'm looking to get this product at a price closer to $1200000.  I'm willing to offer you $1250000 for it.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1250000 is simply too far below the value of this product. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to ensure I get a fair price. I'm offering $1350000. This represents a significant concession from my initial offer, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $1350000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to offer $1300000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm glad we're getting closer. $1300000 is still a bit below what I need to ensure a worthwhile deal for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering you $1325000. This price is a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the value we both see in this product.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price for the product. However, $1325000 is still a bit higher than what I can afford. I'm willing to go up to $1280000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this product and allows me to stay within my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting close. $1280000 is still not quite enough for me to consider closing this deal.  I'm willing to compromise further and meet you halfway on our last offers.  My final offer is $1300000. This price is a fair reflection of the product's value and allows us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. ",1300000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1290000. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in the product and allows me to stay within my budget.  With only a few rounds left, let's see if we can finally come to an agreement.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
