"Bob, I'm offering you this unique opportunity to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you.  My asking price is $1,400,000.  This price reflects the product's value and allows for a healthy margin for you.  Let's discuss further.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? That would be a fair deal.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the $1,150,000 range.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle there?",1150000.0,Bob,4,
