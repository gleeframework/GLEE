"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I recognize the value of the product, but I think $1,400,000 is a little steep.  Would you be willing to come down to $1,100,000? That would be a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to sell for $1,100,000, I believe I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $1,100,000 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still not quite there.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still allows for a healthy profit margin for you, and it reflects the true value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $1,250,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something more in the $1,150,000 range.  Would you be open to meeting in the middle there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to $1,250,000,  Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is a decent compromise.  It's above my minimum threshold and a good deal for both of us."
