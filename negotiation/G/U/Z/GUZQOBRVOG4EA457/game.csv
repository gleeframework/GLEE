"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.  This price is still fair considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle,  but I need to be at $1,300,000. This price is still well below what I could sell it for elsewhere, but I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a compromise.  While $1,150,000 is closer, I'm still not able to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway *again* and go down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value, and I believe it will work for both of us.",1250000.0,Alice,7,
