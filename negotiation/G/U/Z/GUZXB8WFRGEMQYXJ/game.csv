"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is a fantastic deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,500 might be a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $9,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we settle at $8,500?  That feels like a fair deal to me.",8500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $8,750. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",8750.0,Alice,5,
