Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. Would you be willing to go down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $90 is still a bit low for me. I can do $110, which is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit above my budget.  How about $105?  That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I can see you're really interested in the product, and I appreciate that! I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I can offer you $107.50. That's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not willing to pay more than $100.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer gives me a chance to see if I can get her to drop her price even further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $107.50 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $102.50, which is my final offer.  Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $107.50. I think it's a great price for this amazing product, and I'm confident you'll love it. If you're still interested, I'm willing to meet you at $105, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum price of $100.  With only a few rounds left, it's more beneficial to cut my losses and buy from John at $100. It's unlikely that Alice will drop to my desired price, and continuing the negotiation risks running out of rounds and having to pay more than I'm willing to."
