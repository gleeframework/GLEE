"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you something truly exceptional. This product represents a unique opportunity, and I know it will be incredibly valuable to you. To start the conversation, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000.  I'm confident this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always wise to start negotiations above your desired outcome to allow room for negotiation. This also establishes the perceived value of the product as very high.
* **Gauge Bob's Interest:**  This initial high offer allows us to gauge Bob's interest and negotiation style. His reaction will provide valuable information for future rounds. 
* **Alternative Option:** Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 gives us a strong fallback position. We don't need to settle for anything less than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the proposed price. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise between the product's value and my financial situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $950,000 is a significant amount, it's still below our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and will try to bring him closer to our target range in the next round. We are still above John's offer, so continuing the negotiation makes sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budgetary considerations. However, the value of this product is truly unique and in high demand. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to revise my offer to $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:**  By significantly lowering the initial offer, we demonstrate a willingness to negotiate and find common ground.
* **Maintain a Strong Position:** We are still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer and our guaranteed sale price with John. 
* **Justification:** We are subtly reminding Bob of the product's high demand and value to justify the price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Alice. While I understand the product's unique value, I must respectfully decline. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000. I believe this price is closer to a fair valuation for both parties involved. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is now above our guaranteed sale price with John. While we could continue negotiating and try to get closer to our initial target, there's a risk that Bob might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a profit above our minimum and avoids the potential of losing Bob as a buyer."
