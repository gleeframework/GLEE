Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $10,000. I believe it holds significant value and would be a worthwhile investment for you."", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Respecting Bob's Valuation:** While I know Bob values the product at $8,000, there's a chance he might be willing to pay a premium if he perceives the product as valuable and scarce.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $8,000, so there's no risk of losing money if Bob rejects the offer. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If I had more information about Bob's negotiating style (e.g., aggressive, passive), I could tailor my message accordingly.
* **Product Demand:** If the product is in high demand, I could justify a higher price."
