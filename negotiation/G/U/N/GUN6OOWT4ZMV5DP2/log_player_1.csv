"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $1,350,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $1,350,000 is close to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still in a strong position. I have 8 more rounds to negotiate with Bob and can still sell to John for a solid profit. I'll counter-offer to see if we can find a middle ground closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm not quite there yet. Let's try $1,400,000. It's a good compromise and still leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,375,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still not enough to meet my target. I've got several more rounds to negotiate, and I'm confident I can get closer to my initial asking price. Selling to John at this point would be a safe option, but I'm still hoping to secure a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $1,390,000.  Let's try to find common ground here, as it's getting late in the negotiation."", ""product_price"": 1390000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $1,380,000 for your product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We are now in round 6, leaving only 4 more rounds to reach an agreement. Bob's offer is now very close to my desired price. Accepting this offer ensures a sale with a good profit, and I'm not sure I can squeeze out much more in the remaining rounds. Additionally, the risk of losing Bob as a buyer and having to sell to John for a lower price is becoming a real possibility."
