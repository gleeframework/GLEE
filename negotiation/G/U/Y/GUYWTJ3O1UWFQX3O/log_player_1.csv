Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my asking price, I'm still hoping for a better deal.  I'll see if I can get him to budge a bit more."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need at least $1,080,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,080,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1,020,000. I believe this price is more in line with what I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $1,020,000 is closer than before, I'm not quite ready to sell at that price. I believe I can still get a better offer. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if Bob is willing to budge further."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to think we might not be able to find common ground. I'm willing to meet you one last time, but I need $1,050,000 to make this deal work for me.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not convinced that $1,050,000 is the best price for me. I'm willing to make a serious offer of $990,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000. Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still not high enough.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a better deal by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
