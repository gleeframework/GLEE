Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a profit.  If Bob rejects, we can then see how high he's willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90. While it's better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering at $130. This is a significant step down from my initial offer of $150, but still higher than Bob's offer and above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to compromise and potentially leads to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  Bob's counteroffer of $85 is too low, and I'm not willing to go any lower than my minimum price. It's better to take the guaranteed $120 from John than to risk further negotiation with Bob, which might lead to a lower price or a prolonged process."
