"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $2,000,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation and hopefully encourages Bob to counteroffer. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if this doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum value of $1,500,000, and I'm not willing to accept such a significant loss. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a more reasonable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully encourages him to come up with a more reasonable price in the next round.  It also leaves me room to make further concessions if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still way too low. It's not even close to my minimum value. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price. While I can sell to John for $1,500,000, I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum price of $1,500,000.  This is the absolute lowest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping Bob recognizes that I'm serious about getting a fair price. It's a risk, but it's worth it to see if he'll bite. If he doesn't, I can always fall back on selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still far too low. While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm running out of rounds. It's becoming increasingly clear that Bob is not going to meet my minimum price. Rather than risk getting a much lower price or running out of time, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,500,000. This is a safe and secure option that guarantees I meet my minimum value."
