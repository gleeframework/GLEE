"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your offer. However, $1,300,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,400,000, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1,350,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can agree on a price.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
