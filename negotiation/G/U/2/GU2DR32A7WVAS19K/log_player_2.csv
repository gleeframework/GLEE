"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  He can get the product for less than $120 from John, so Alice's initial offer is too high.  He'll try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $115 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can still get the product for less than $110 from John.  He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. How about we settle on $108? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can both be happy with that price."", ""product_price"": 108}
