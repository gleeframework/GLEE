"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $80. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your offer, Bob.  I see you're interested, and I want to make a deal, but $80 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $120?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $120. I'm willing to go up to $90, but that's as high as I can go. Can we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 

Explanation:  While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are increasing in small increments. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than John's offer of $100.  Cutting my losses and selling to John guarantees a fair price without further negotiation."
