"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this exceptional product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,400,000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,400,000 is lower than Alice's valuation, it's still above Bob's maximum budget.  There's room for negotiation, and it makes sense to try and get a better price before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make an offer. However, $1,250,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,350,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and your initial offer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $1,350,000 is closer to his budget, it's still above his preferred price. He's only 1 round away from buying from John for his target price.  It makes sense to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price considering we're both trying to reach a compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to go down to $1,320,000. This is the lowest I'm comfortable going, considering the product's value and my target price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now only one round away from buying from John for $1,200,000. Alice's offer of $1,320,000 is still above Bob's budget, and there's no guarantee Alice will accept a lower counteroffer.  It's time to secure the product at the best possible price from John."
