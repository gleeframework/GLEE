"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal.  What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,025,000. Can you consider this price?",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit off from where I need to be.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $1,037,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away feeling good about the deal.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
