"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Can you consider my offer?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I understand your offer, $9,500 is below what I'm hoping for.  I'm willing to come down a little, but I need to get at least $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's keep talking and see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,800 for the product. Can you consider my offer?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $9,800 is still not quite there for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $10,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's finalize this and move forward.",10000.0,Alice,5,
