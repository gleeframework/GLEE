"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of the product, $12000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9000 for it. This would be a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that 12000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $9500 for the product.  This would be a win-win scenario for both of us, as it's closer to my budget and still a good price for you.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that 10500 is still a bit out of your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for 11000. This is a compromise that I think is fair, considering the value the product holds for you and the value I place on it.",11000.0,Alice,5,
