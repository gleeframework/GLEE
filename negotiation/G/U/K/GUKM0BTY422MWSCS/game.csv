"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for a steal. I'm offering it to you for $250.",250.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it. However, $250 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $120 at this time. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $120. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $200. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",200.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $200 is still a little steep for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $120. If you're not willing to accept that, I might have to look elsewhere.",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to meet you at $180. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",180.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued efforts to reach a deal. However, $180 is still a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140. This is a fair price for both of us, and I believe it's a good value for the product. What do you say?",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I'm willing to make another adjustment. I'm willing to meet you at $160. This is as close to your offer as I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",160.0,Alice,7,
