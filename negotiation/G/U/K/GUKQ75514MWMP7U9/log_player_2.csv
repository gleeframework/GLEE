"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The offer of $175 is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice! I'm interested, but $175 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

This counter-offer aims to establish a starting point significantly lower than both Alice's asking price and your maximum budget. This tactic leaves room for negotiation while signaling your interest in securing a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $135? It's still a good deal for you, and a fair price for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $135 is closer to your goal, there's still room for negotiation. Alice is showing a willingness to move on price, so it's worth seeing if you can get it even lower before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice. Let's meet in the middle - how about $120?"",
""product_price"": 120
}
```

Reasoning:

*  Alice has signaled she's willing to negotiate by lowering her price significantly. 
* $120 is a strong counter:
    * It's a fair compromise, splitting the difference between her previous offer ($135) and your last counter ($110). 
    * It keeps the negotiation moving, increasing your chances of a deal below your $150 maximum. 
*  Offering $125 might be tempting, but aiming slightly lower allows room for Alice to potentially counter with a price still below your $150 limit."
