"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While I recognize the value you see in the product, $900,000 falls significantly short of what I can accept.  I'm willing to move a bit on my initial price.  How about we meet halfway at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to move on your initial price. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, which would be $950,000. Could we discuss this further?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence. I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $950,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, I'm willing to accept it under one condition: [Insert a reasonable condition that adds value to the deal for you - e.g., Bob refers another client, Bob pays in a shorter timeframe, etc.].  If that works for you, we have a deal.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not comfortable with adding any conditions to the deal. I'd like to make a new counteroffer. How about we meet at $920,000, and I'll pay in a timely manner? This way, we can finalize the deal without any additional requirements.",920000.0,Bob,6,
