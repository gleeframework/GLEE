"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the product's value, but $11,000 is a bit steep for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is significantly less than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $10,250?  It's a small step closer, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  I'm still quite a bit away from my budget. Would you consider $9,500?  I'm hoping to get this done today.",9500.0,Bob,4,
