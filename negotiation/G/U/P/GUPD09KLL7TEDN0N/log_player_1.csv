Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and it leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above my minimum price of $800,000 but significantly below the product's worth to Bob. This strategy aims to:

* **Start high:** It gives me room to negotiate downwards if Bob rejects my initial offer.
* **Be fair:** It acknowledges Bob's potential gain while still securing a good profit for me.
* **Open communication:** The message emphasizes fairness and encourages Bob to respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

While Bob's offer is higher than what John is offering, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob.  It's worth continuing the negotiation and seeing if we can reach a more mutually beneficial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer. How about we settle at $1,050,000? This allows for a healthy profit for both of us, and keeps the deal within your budget."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we settle at $950,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

$950,000 is a good price, considering it's closer to my minimum price and still a significant profit for me.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Bob walking away or me losing time and ultimately selling to John for less is too high. This offer is a good compromise and secures a strong sale."
