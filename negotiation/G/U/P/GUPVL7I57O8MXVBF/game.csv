"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1200000 is a good starting point, it's still below my desired price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This takes into account your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is my absolute maximum. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1250000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1300000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as I really like the product.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 simply doesn't work for me.  To be honest, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to come down to $1275000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about this deal, let me know if you can meet me there.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1275000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",1200000.0,Bob,8,
