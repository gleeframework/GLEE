"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. This is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, giving him room to negotiate.
* **Leaving Room for Bargaining:**  $1,400,000 is still less than my minimum, allowing for potential counteroffers without me having to go below my bottom line.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to start the negotiation on a positive note."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1400000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to go. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* **Still early in the negotiation:**  I have 8 rounds left to try and close the deal with Bob at a more favorable price. 
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  I can likely make a counteroffer that's closer to my desired price point and still be within Bob's range of willingness to pay."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a good starting point, it's still below my desired price. Let's find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This takes into account your budget while still allowing me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising but not conceding:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but not all the way. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that the product has real value.
* **Highlighting the middle ground:**  I'm emphasizing that $1,350,000 is a ""middle ground,"" implying fairness and a win-win situation.
* **Reinforcing my own value:**  By stating I need to make a ""reasonable profit,"" I'm reminding Bob of the product's inherent worth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1350000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $1250000, which is my absolute maximum. Can you consider meeting me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:** $1,250,000 is still slightly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Room for a counteroffer:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer, there's still room for a counteroffer that would be more profitable for me.
* **Not yet at a point of urgency:**  I have 6 rounds left, and selling to John is always an option if I need to, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept a low offer yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $1,250,000 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  This would allow us both to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer, but still above my minimum:**  $1,300,000 is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Emphasizing compromise:**  I'm highlighting the fact that I'm willing to compromise to meet him halfway.
* **Focusing on mutual benefit:**  I'm framing the offer as a win-win situation, suggesting that a deal at this price is good for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1300000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. I'm hoping we can meet at this price, as I really like the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  $1,200,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Limited rounds remaining:** With only 4 rounds left, I need to be cautious about accepting an offer that is significantly below my desired price.
* **Potential for a higher counteroffer:**  There's still a chance I can get Bob to come up to a more acceptable price.
* **John as a backup:**  Knowing that I can sell to John for $1,500,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't work for me.  To be honest, I'm starting to feel like we're not going to be able to reach an agreement.  However, I'm willing to make one final concession. I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000.  This is my absolute bottom line. If you're serious about this deal, let me know if you can meet me there."", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last offer, putting pressure on Bob to make a decision.
* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:** $1,275,000 is closer to Bob's offer, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.
* **Creating urgency:** By suggesting that we might not reach an agreement, I'm making Bob think that he might lose out on the deal if he doesn't accept. 
* **Focus on the deal's value:**  I'm reminding Bob that I'm making a significant concession, implying the deal is still valuable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your concession, but I'm afraid $1275000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1200000, which is the maximum I'm willing to spend. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only two rounds left, the likelihood of Bob increasing his offer significantly is low.
* **John's offer is better:**  John is willing to pay $1,500,000, which is far more profitable than Bob's offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Avoiding a potential loss:**  There's a risk that Bob might not increase his offer, and I would end up selling to him at a price that is significantly below my minimum. 

It's better to secure the deal with John at a price that meets my minimum requirements rather than risking a lower price with Bob."
