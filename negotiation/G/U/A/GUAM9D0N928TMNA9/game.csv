"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe would be incredibly valuable to you. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course.",1500000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $1,100,000? This represents a significant investment on my end and would be a fair starting point for further negotiations.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,100,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver significant value.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a compromise on my end. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
