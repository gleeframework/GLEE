Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,500,000 is a bit beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product but would need to see a lower price to make it work. How about $1,100,000? This represents a significant investment on my end and would be a fair starting point for further negotiations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a compromise on my end. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a fair transaction for both of us.
