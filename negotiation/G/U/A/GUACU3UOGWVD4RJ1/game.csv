"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is way too high for me. I'm thinking closer to $8,000.  What do you say?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  This product offers a lot of value, and I believe $17,000 is a fair price that reflects its worth.  What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $17,000 is still outside my budget. Could we meet somewhere around $10,000? It's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",10000.0,Bob,4,
