Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my [product name] for $10,000. I know it's worth a lot to me, but I believe it would be a great deal for you. Let me know if you're interested! "", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **The price:** $10,000 is a compromise. It's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me, but still leaves me with a profit. 
* **The message:**  It's friendly and emphasizes the value for Bob.  It doesn't explicitly mention John, as that might make Bob less likely to accept.

**Why this strategy?**

* **Maximizing profit:** This strategy aims to maximize profit by securing a deal with Bob while still getting a reasonable price. It's better to sell for $10,000 than to wait and sell to John for $15,000.
* **Minimizing risk:**  By offering a lower price, I increase the chances of Bob accepting. This minimizes the risk of having to wait and sell to John.
* **Building a relationship:** This strategy also allows for potential future interactions with Bob, as he might be more likely to consider buying from me again in the future."
