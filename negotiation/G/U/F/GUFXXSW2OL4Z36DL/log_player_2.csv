Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price, but $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate us working towards a deal. However, we're still quite far apart in terms of price. I need to see a significant move to justify continuing this negotiation. To be transparent, I have other options for selling this product. So, I'm proposing $1,700,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the value this product offers.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you have other options, and I appreciate the concessions you've made so far.  However, that price point is still a bit too rich for me.  To be completely transparent, I can get this product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  If you're able to come down to $1,100,000, I'm ready to close this deal today."", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
