"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I'm asking for $12,000.  I think it's a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I can only offer $7,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $7,000 is too low, I'm willing to come down to $10,000.  I'm confident you'll find this offer reasonable. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still too high.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price.  There are still plenty of rounds left to work with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  $10,000 is closer, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $8,500? That would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8500}
