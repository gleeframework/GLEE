"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $120. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $175. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
