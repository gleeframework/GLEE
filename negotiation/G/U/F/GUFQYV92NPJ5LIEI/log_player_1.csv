Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's significantly higher than your floor price:**  You're aiming to get as much as possible, and this price is well above your minimum.
* **It's a good compromise:**  It's less than what the product is worth to Bob, giving him a potential profit, but it's also more than what you'd get from John, so you're not losing out. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can potentially increase the price if Bob is willing to negotiate.
