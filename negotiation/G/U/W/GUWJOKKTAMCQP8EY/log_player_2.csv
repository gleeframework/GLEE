"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's try to negotiate a better price with Alice before resorting to John.  Alice's starting offer is quite high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  I'm interested, but I could only go as high as $6,000."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a significantly lower offer ($6,000) to see how much Alice is willing to move on the price. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Expressing Interest:** I'm making it clear that I am interested in the product, but only at a price point that works for me. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even though I'm starting low, I'm leaving room to potentially increase my offer in later rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,000? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired value. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met our target price! There's no point in continuing the negotiation or going with John, as we've achieved the best possible outcome."
