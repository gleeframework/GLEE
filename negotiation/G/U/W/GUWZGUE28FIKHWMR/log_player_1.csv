Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is a fair price given the value we both see in it, and it gives us both room to profit. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise that leaves both of us with a profitable deal. Let's see if we can close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
