"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a reasonable offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I see the potential in this product, $1200000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $1000000 for it. This is a fair price given the value we both see in it, and it gives us both room to profit. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you a price of $1100000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1100000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to go up to $1050000.  This is a fair compromise that leaves both of us with a profitable deal. Let's see if we can close this out.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1050000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer you a price of $1080000. This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value and potential. What do you think?",1080000.0,Alice,5,
