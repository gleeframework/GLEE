This is a good time to accept Alice's offer.  Here's why:

* **Price is right:**  You're getting the product for $918,750, saving you $281,250 off John's price and a significant amount off Alice's initial offer. 
* **""Final offer"" signal:**  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  While she might be bluffing, there's a risk she won't budge further, and you'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John.

It's always tempting to try and squeeze out a little more, but in this case, the risk outweighs the potential reward."
