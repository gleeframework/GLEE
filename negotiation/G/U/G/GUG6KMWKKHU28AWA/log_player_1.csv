"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'll reject Bob's offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $13,000 is too low. I'll counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $13,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $15,500?  Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $15500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $14000? I think that's a fair price for this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Bob's offer again.  $14,000 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to continue negotiating. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $14,000 is still too far below my desired price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need at least $14,500 to make this deal work. Let's find a common ground so we can both be happy with the outcome."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $13500? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can agree on this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd like to get more, Bob's offers are getting too low, and I'm concerned that we won't reach an agreement that's fair for me.  John's offer guarantees me my minimum value, so it's the best option for me right now."
