"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be very valuable to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $10,000. This is a great deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option with John for $12,000. There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower her price further, getting you a better deal."
