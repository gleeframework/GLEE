Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,200,000.  Let me know your decision."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially a much higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin if he's willing to pay a premium.
* **Anchoring Bias:**  By starting with a high number, you might anchor Bob's perception of the product's value, making him more amenable to a price higher than $800,000. 

**Important Note:** This is a starting point. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters your offer. You can always decrease the price, but you can't increase it once offered."
