Round 2

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this, I believe it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice has come down in price, her ""final offer"" of $825,000 is still more than John's offer of $800,000.  It makes more financial sense to go with the guaranteed lower price from John at this point."
