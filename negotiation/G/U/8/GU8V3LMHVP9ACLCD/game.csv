"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $900,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $700,000 for the product.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price. Let's try to find a compromise. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal. However, $750,000 just doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $825,000, but this is my final offer. If you're serious about acquiring this, I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
