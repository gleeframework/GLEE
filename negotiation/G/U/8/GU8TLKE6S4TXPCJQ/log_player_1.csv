Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $175. This gives Bob a bit of room to negotiate, but still leaves me a profit margin.  If he rejects, I'll see how low he's willing to go before I consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  While I'd prefer a higher price, it's not worth risking further negotiation.  Accepting his offer ensures I get the desired $150."
