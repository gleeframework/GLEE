"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to John's price, Bob can likely get a better price by counter-offering.  Since Alice is willing to sell for $10,000, there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I do value the product, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about we split the difference and settle on $10,500? This would still leave you with a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. How about we settle on $11,250? This is still a great deal for you, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's not the absolute lowest possible price, it's a good compromise.  Here's why:

* **Saving Money:**  $11,250 is still $750 less than buying from John.
* **Further Negotiation is Risky:**  Alice is already close to her minimum price. Continuing to negotiate could result in her walking away or offering a price closer to $12,000.

Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a decent price without risking a worse outcome."
