"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have the product you're interested in. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a better price than John's $150, you can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  You're willing to pay up to $150, so there's room to haggle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. How about $100? I'm really interested in the product, and I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $130. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is still better than John's price, you're still willing to pay less. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice. There's still room for compromise, and you could potentially get the product for closer to your desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $115. That's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I can do $125, but that's as low as I can go. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to make a profit on this sale. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $125 is a good deal for you. It's less than what you were willing to pay John ($150) and also less than your previous counter-offer ($115).  While you could continue to negotiate, there's no guarantee Alice will come down further.  You've reached a good compromise and should accept her offer."
