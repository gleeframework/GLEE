"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $800,000, and I'm willing to make a concession to get the deal done quickly.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being flexible. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This would be a win-win for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that I think is fair considering the value it brings to you and the original price I was looking for.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is still a little outside my budget. I'm happy to go up to $825,000. This is a reasonable offer, as it's closer to my maximum budget and still leaves you with a healthy profit.",825000.0,Bob,4,
