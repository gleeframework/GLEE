"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $100. This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",100.0,Alice,5,
