"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and encouraging to keep the negotiation open.
* **Leaving room for counteroffer:** The price is not too high to deter Bob from making a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **$90 is too low:**  While it's better than Bob's initial perceived value, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Room for negotiation:** I can still make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more profitable agreement.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Knowing John is willing to pay $150 allows me to be more assertive in negotiations with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible. However, $90 is simply too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $105?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:** I'm offering a price that's halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Positive and encouraging message:** I'm keeping the tone friendly and reminding Bob of the value of the product.
* **Staying above my minimum:**  $105 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but it leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go as low as $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $95 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. While it's closer, I'm not yet ready to accept it.
* **Room for a final counteroffer:**  There's still room for me to make a final counteroffer in the next round, potentially securing a price closer to my desired range.
* **John's offer is the backup:** I'm confident that I can reach a better deal with Bob, but John's offer is a safety net if negotiations fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $95 is still a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $100. This would be a good price for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product very valuable.  This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm stating clearly that this is my last offer to create urgency and pressure Bob to accept.
* **Slight compromise:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to reinforce my position. 
* **Setting the stage for a potential deal:** By making this my final offer, I'm hoping to close the deal in this round.  If Bob rejects, I'm prepared to move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:** With only 4 rounds left, I'm getting close to my deadline.
* **No more room for compromise:** $92 is too far below my minimum acceptable price.  Further negotiation would likely just waste time.
* **John's offer is secure:** I have a guaranteed $150 from John, which is significantly better than the current offer from Bob.

I'm choosing to sell to John to secure the best possible price and avoid the risk of losing out on a better deal."
