{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $95.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation by offering a price slightly above Bob's perceived value but significantly below your minimum. It opens the door for further negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $85 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't sell for less than $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and I'm happy to continue negotiating.  While I understand you're looking for a lower price, $85 is unfortunately still below my minimum.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. Would you be willing to consider $90? "", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $87.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $87.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.  I've already gone through a couple of rounds of negotiation, and I'm not sure how much further Bob is willing to go. It's better to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $100."
