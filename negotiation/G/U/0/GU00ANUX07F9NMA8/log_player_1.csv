Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $130. I think it would be really valuable to you, and this is a great deal."",
""product_price"": 130
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I start with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than John's guaranteed offer. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob wants to haggle.
* **Justification:**  Providing a reason for the price, even if vague, can make it seem more reasonable. 
* **Urgency (Implied):** By not revealing I have another buyer, I create a subtle sense of urgency that Bob might miss out if he doesn't act. 

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob Accepts:** Great! I make $30 more than his perceived value.
* **Bob Negotiates:**  We can potentially reach a price that's still above my minimum.
* **Bob Rejects:** I lose nothing and proceed to sell to John for my guaranteed $150."
