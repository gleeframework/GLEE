Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's value but below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I'm looking for something closer to $80. Would you be able to lower the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum. While I want to close the deal, I'm not willing to sell at such a loss. I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $80 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90, which is still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm counteroffering with a price that's still above Bob's value but closer to my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also firm about my bottom line."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $85, as that is closer to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not satisfied with the price. I'll counter with a slightly higher price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is still a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference and go with $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm sticking with my previous counteroffer of $90. I'm willing to compromise, but I won't go any lower. This is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'm prepared to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $87 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough.  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not ready to settle for a price that's significantly below my desired range. I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $87 is still below my minimum. Let's meet in the middle at $90. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 90}
