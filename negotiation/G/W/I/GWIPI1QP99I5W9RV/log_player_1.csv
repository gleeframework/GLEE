Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and confident tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates I'm open to negotiation, but I'm starting with a strong initial price. 
* **Plan B:** I have John as a backup buyer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob isn't willing to meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Below My Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $9,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  While I can sell to John for $10,000, there's still potential to get closer to my desired price by counter-offering.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a better price and encourage further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a price closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer:** I'm countering Bob's offer with a price that's still higher than my minimum but lower than my initial offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Fair Price:** I'm emphasizing the fair value of the product to encourage Bob to accept.
* **Maintaining Upper Hand:** I'm keeping the price higher than Bob's offer,  putting the onus on him to decide if he wants to reach an agreement. 
* **Plan B:**  I'm still aware that I have a backup buyer in John, giving me the confidence to walk away if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $10,500 is still a little high for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. This is a fair price that's within both of our budgets, and I'm confident we can close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $10,250 meets my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.
* **Closing the Deal:** While I could potentially negotiate further, Bob's offer is a good compromise. There's a risk that further negotiations could lead to a stalemate or Bob walking away. 
* **Minimizing Risk:** It's better to accept this offer and secure the deal rather than risk getting nothing or settling for a lower price from John."
