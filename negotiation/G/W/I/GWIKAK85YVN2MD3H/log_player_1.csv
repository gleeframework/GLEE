Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a unique product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. Would you be interested in purchasing it for $20,000?"", ""product_price"": 20000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for offering the product. I appreciate the value you place on it, but I am only able to offer $15000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe the product is worth more than $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not able to let go of the product for that price.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $17,500? It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that."", ""product_price"": 17500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Let's try $16000 as my final offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $16,000 is close to my minimum threshold. There's a good chance we won't reach a higher price in subsequent rounds, and I don't want to risk losing this sale altogether."
