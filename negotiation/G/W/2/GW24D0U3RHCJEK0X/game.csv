"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the product's value, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects my budget and the product's potential.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product has significant potential, and I'm confident it will bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $900,000.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from this deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
