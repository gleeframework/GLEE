{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $14,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,000 creates a sense of urgency and potential gain for Bob. It's a significant markup from his perceived value ($12,000) but still attractive compared to your alternative buyer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While you've set a strong initial price, there's some flexibility if Bob tries to negotiate a slightly lower price, keeping you above your minimum."
