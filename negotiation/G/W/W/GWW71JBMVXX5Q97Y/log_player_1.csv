"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value to see if I can get closer to my desired profit.  I'm hoping to leverage the fact that Bob values the product at $80 and might be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $120 is above Bob's valuation, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still aiming for a profit above my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise, especially considering he initially rejected my offer of $175."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $140 is above my minimum acceptable price.  It's also getting close to John's offer, and I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a better price from Bob in the next round."
