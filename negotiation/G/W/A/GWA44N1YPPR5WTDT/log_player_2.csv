"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  I think that's a fair offer considering its value to me."",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  I'm starting significantly lower than Alice's asking price ($12,000) and my maximum budget ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Justification:** By explaining that the price is based on my perceived value of the product, I'm signaling that I'm serious but also that I have a limit.
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:** I want to reach an agreement with Alice if possible, but I'm also prepared to walk away and buy from John for $8,000 if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, Bob. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down significantly, $9,000 is still above my $8,000 maximum.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Her willingness to meet ""halfway"" suggests there's more flexibility in her price. 
* **Alternative Option:** I have the safety net of buying from John at $8,000 if the negotiation doesn't go my way."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we settle at $7,000? That's a significant increase from my last offer and a good deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer to $7,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate but staying below my maximum budget.
* **Highlighting Mutual Benefit:**  I'm framing this price as a win-win, offering Alice a good deal while saving myself money.
* **Applying Pressure:**  Alice now knows I'm serious and getting closer to my limit. She has to decide if she'll accept a lower price or risk losing the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I think I can do a bit better than $7,000. How about we meet at $8,500? That's still a good deal for you, but it's getting closer to my minimum price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reached the Limit:** Alice is now only willing to go down to $8,500, which is still above my maximum budget of $8,000. 
* **Better Alternative:** I have the option to buy the product from John for $8,000, which is a better deal than Alice is offering.
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** Further back-and-forth is unlikely to result in a price I'm willing to pay. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed option."
