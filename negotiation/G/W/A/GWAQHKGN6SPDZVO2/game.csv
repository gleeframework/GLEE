"Bob, I appreciate you making an offer and recognizing the value of this product.  While I'm looking for a price closer to $2,000,000, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000 if we can close the deal quickly. This offer stands for the next 24 hours.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your effort to find a price that works for both of us. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This is a significant concession on my part and reflects my desire to see this deal through. However, I need you to meet me halfway. What are you prepared to offer?",1600000.0,Alice,5,
