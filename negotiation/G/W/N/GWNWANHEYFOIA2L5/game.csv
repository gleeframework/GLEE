"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit higher than I was hoping for. How about $95? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be fair for both of us.",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I have to make a profit, and $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'd like to pay.  How about $105? This would be a good price for both of us, and we could finalize the deal.",105.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, and $105 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet at $115?",115.0,Alice,5,
