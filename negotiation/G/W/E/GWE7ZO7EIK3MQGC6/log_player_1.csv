{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is my minimum, I believe the product is worth more.  I'm going to try and get a better price from Bob before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12,000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500 to see if we can find common ground. This product really is exceptional, and I think it's worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 13500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12750. I think this is a fair price for a great product like this. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $12,750 is getting closer to my desired price. It's worth taking that offer and closing the deal. While I could try to get a bit more, the risk of losing the sale to another buyer or going through more rounds of negotiation isn't worth it at this point."
