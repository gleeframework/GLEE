"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12000. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product, but I need to make sure it's within my budget.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $12000 is my absolute minimum, I'm willing to come down a bit to $13500 to see if we can find common ground. This product really is exceptional, and I think it's worth the investment.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12750. I think this is a fair price for a great product like this.",12750.0,Bob,4,
