"Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is far above your maximum budget of $12,000.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, but still within a range that might be appealing to her if she's motivated to sell.  This gives me room to negotiate further if she rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is still above my budget.  While it's closer than her initial price, I believe there's still room to negotiate a lower price. I'll reject her offer and try again with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price slightly, indicating she might be willing to negotiate. My counteroffer of $11,500 is still below my absolute maximum of $12,000 but demonstrates my willingness to meet her halfway.  This leaves room for another counteroffer if necessary."
