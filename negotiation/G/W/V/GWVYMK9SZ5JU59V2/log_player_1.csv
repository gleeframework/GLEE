Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 18000} 
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $18,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a decent profit if Bob accepts. I also believe that if Bob is truly interested, he might be willing to pay a premium for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm not willing to sell at that price. I will make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000} 
```

I'm offering $15,000. This is still a good profit for me and it's closer to Bob's offer, making it more likely for him to accept. I believe this is a fair compromise and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's latest offer is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still not quite there. I'm also not sure if he's willing to go any higher. To avoid further haggling, I'm going to sell the product to John for $12,000. This ensures I get at least my minimum price and avoids any potential risks of further negotiation."
