"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $130 is a good price, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice. There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it for closer to my $150 limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you consider $125? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $135. I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $135 is closer to my target, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so I'll try another counteroffer to see if I can get it lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. How about $130? It's closer to your initial offer and a good price point for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go back to my initial offer. I'm willing to make another concession and offer $137.50. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you and my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $137.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $137.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate but seems firm on not going lower than $137.50.  This price is within my budget and getting closer to my ideal price.  It's time to accept the offer and avoid the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal or needing to buy from John at a higher price."
