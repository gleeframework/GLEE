"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,000,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to make an offer, but I'm afraid $850,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counter with a price of $950,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  Let's try to find a compromise that works for both of us. ",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900,000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'll meet you at $925,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
