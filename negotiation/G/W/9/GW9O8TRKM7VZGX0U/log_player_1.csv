Send your offer to Bob.","```json

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value. I could be flexible to $900,000. This feels like a fair compromise."", 
""product_price"": 900000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about $750,000? I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is slowly increasing his offer, indicating interest. We're still below John's offer, but we have room to negotiate further and potentially secure a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're getting closer! I'm seeing the value you place on this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  How about we settle at $850,000?"", 
""product_price"": 850000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your flexibility. To be honest, I have another offer at $800,000. If you're able to match that, I'm ready to close the deal today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has now matched John's offer. There's no strategic advantage in continuing to negotiate or waiting for a potentially higher offer from Bob. Accepting now secures the $800,000 and avoids the risk of Bob lowering his offer or walking away in subsequent rounds."
