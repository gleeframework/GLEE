Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,450,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering the value it holds for you.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're already making a profit above your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to negotiate down to a price he's happy with, while also ensuring you don't sell too low.
* **It shows confidence:** Starting at a higher price demonstrates your confidence in the value of the product. 

Remember, you can always adjust your price based on Bob's response and the progress of the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is still above your minimum, it's significantly lower than your initial offer. It's worth trying to push for a better price, especially since the product is worth more to Bob.  By rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer, you can see if you can reach a compromise closer to your initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000, which still leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a good strategy because:

* **It shows flexibility:** You're willing to compromise from your initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **It's a reasonable compromise:**  You're not going too low, but also not holding out for your initial price.
* **It emphasizes finding a win-win:** By mentioning ""room for both of us to be happy,"" you emphasize the collaborative nature of the negotiation.

Remember, the goal is to find a price that works for both of you. By being reasonable but firm, you can increase your chances of closing the deal at a profitable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit far from your new offer. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,375,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,375,000 is a reasonable compromise. It's significantly higher than John's offer of $1,200,000 and still allows you to make a profit. While you might prefer a slightly higher price, continuing the negotiation could risk losing Bob as a buyer altogether. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and maximizes your potential earnings."
