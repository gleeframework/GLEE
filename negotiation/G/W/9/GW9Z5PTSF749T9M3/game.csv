"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $8,000. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $10,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,200. This is the lowest I can go without losing money on the deal. What do you think?",8200.0,Alice,5,
