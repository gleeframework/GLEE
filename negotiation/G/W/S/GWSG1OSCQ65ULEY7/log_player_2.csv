"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm willing to let it go for $14,000, a fair price that I think you'll agree is a great deal. Would you like to make it yours? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling for $14,000, which is less than John's price of $15,000.
* **You're still within your budget:** Even though you'd prefer to pay less, $14,000 is still within your $15,000 limit. 

Therefore, it's more advantageous to accept Alice's offer to save $1,000."
