"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $18,000 is way above Bob's budget of $10,000.  It's definitely worth rejecting and trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $12,000. My revised offer is $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price point.  Bob is willing to negotiate further to try to get a better deal. There are still multiple rounds available, and it's worth pushing for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $13,000?  This is my final offer."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to push the price down, but I'm not comfortable going below $14,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. My final offer is $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $13,500 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Since this is her ""final offer"",  it's likely Bob won't be able to get a lower price from her.  Accepting this offer is the best choice for Bob, as it's still significantly cheaper than buying from John, and he's saved $4,500 from Alice's initial offer."
