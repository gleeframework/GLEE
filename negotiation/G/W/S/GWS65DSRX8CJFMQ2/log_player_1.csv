Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to $100 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $80.
* **John as Backup:** We have a guaranteed sale at $100 if Bob declines.

Offering the product at $95 creates a tempting situation for Bob. He gets a $5 discount from what you value it at, and it's a better deal than losing out entirely."
