"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm very interested in the product, but my budget is around $800,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $900,000. I can offer it to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
