"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",150.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  While it seems like a great product, $150 is a bit outside my budget. Would you consider $100?",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $130, which is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, if I do say so myself!",130.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we split the difference and do $115?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like the way you think, Bob! Splitting the difference is a great idea. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $125. It's still a great deal, and I'm willing to compromise. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,5,
