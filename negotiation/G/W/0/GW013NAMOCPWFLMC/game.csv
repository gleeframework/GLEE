"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $130 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit to $115. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $107.50 is closer, but I'm still a bit far off from where I need to be. Let's try $112.50. I think this is a fair compromise and allows us both to get a good deal.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for coming down a bit. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $110. That's a fair compromise in my opinion.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer! How about we split the difference and settle on $111? This is my final offer, I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",111.0,Alice,7,
