"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a mutually beneficial deal. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll find it a fair price, considering its value to you is $800,000. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,000,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is more in line with your budget.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
