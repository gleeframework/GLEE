Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product,  $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $800,000, which is the maximum I can afford.  This price is fair considering the value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial transaction. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
