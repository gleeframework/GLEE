"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $20000 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $18000. It's a fair price considering its value and rarity. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18000 is still too high for me.  I'm sticking to my original offer of $10000. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on.",10000.0,Bob,4,
