Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice. However, $140 is still more than I'm looking to spend. How about we split the difference again and settle at $110?

You have three options:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate that offer, but it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $105, but that's my absolute limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering. Accepting Bob's current offer of $105 is a $45 loss compared to John's guaranteed $150.  It's time to cut negotiations with Bob and secure the guaranteed sale."
