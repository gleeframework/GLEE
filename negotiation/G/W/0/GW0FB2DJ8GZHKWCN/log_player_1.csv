Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. I'm willing to part with it for $95. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $100, you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product for more than $100 is pointless, as Bob will definitely refuse. Offering it at exactly $100 leaves no room for negotiation and potential profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $95 is a price that is likely to be tempting for Bob (as it's significantly less than his perceived value of $80) while still netting you a profit above your minimum. 
 
This strategy aims to strike a balance between making the offer attractive to Bob and maximizing your potential earnings."
