"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,500,000. I'm willing to pay a premium, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can we meet in the middle at $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,800,000 is closer to what I have in mind, the value this product brings is truly exceptional. How about we settle at $2,100,000? This reflects its true worth while acknowledging your interest.",2100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that the product has value, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,800,000 to $2,100,000, so I'll offer $1,950,000. This is my final offer.",1950000.0,Bob,4,
