Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This product is truly top-notch and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment."", ""product_price"": 9000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit above that price point. I'm thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchasing the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
At this point, Bob is offering $8,500, which is a reasonable profit above my minimum price. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk losing him as a buyer if I push further.
