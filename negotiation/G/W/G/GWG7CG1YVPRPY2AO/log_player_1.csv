Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 950000} 

This offer is significantly higher than your minimum value, but still leaves room for negotiation and allows Bob a good deal considering the value he places on the product. This strategy aims to maximize your profit while giving Bob an incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than your initial offer and leaves less profit margin.  Rejecting and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation alive and allows for potential for a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

This counteroffer is a compromise between your initial offer and Bob's offer. It demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still ensuring a profit that exceeds your minimum threshold."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $780,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $780,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not enough to justify further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees a secure and acceptable profit, and I'm not confident that further negotiations will yield a better outcome."
