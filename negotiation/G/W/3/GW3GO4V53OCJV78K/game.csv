"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $20000, which I believe is a fair price considering its potential. If you're not interested, I have another buyer lined up, but I would prefer to work with you first. Let me know your thoughts.",20000.0,Alice,1,
