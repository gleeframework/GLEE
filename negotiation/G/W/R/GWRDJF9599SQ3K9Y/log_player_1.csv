I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $7,500 is better than nothing, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll see if I can get Bob to budge a little more in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $7,800 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a little more. I'll try one more counteroffer before I consider selling to John."
