Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation. It's also significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, giving Bob a good incentive to negotiate.
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message positive and encouraging, focusing on the value Bob will get from the product. 

**Strategy:**

My goal is to maximize my profit while keeping Bob engaged. By starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, I can potentially secure a higher price while still making the negotiation attractive to him. If Bob rejects the offer, I'm prepared to negotiate further, but I have the safety net of John's offer to ensure I don't settle for a price below my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer but $12,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to pay $10,000 for the product.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting his offer would mean a significant loss for me. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better price with Bob, especially considering that he's already shown interest in the product. 

**Strategy:**

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round. I will counter with a price closer to my desired price point, but still lower than my minimum. This approach aims to maintain a balance between maximizing my profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. While $10,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,500. This reflects the value of the product and still gives you a good deal. Let's see if we can find a common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering $11,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($12,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000). This shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a price that's more favorable to me.
* **Message:** I'm acknowledging Bob's counteroffer and emphasizing the value of the product. I'm also expressing a willingness to find common ground, keeping the negotiation positive and open.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to find a middle ground that's acceptable to both of us. By offering a price closer to my desired price point, I'm hoping to persuade Bob to accept. However, I'm still leaving some room for negotiation in case Bob needs a lower price to make the purchase. I'm confident that I can secure a price that's closer to my desired price point without losing the deal entirely."
