Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm thrilled to offer you this unique product! It's worth a considerable amount to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. I'm starting with an offer of $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need a price that aligns better with my budget. How about we try something around $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is better than John's offer, I'm still aiming for a higher price. Bob is clearly interested, and we have 8 rounds remaining. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer but still above my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. Let's split the difference. How about $1,050,000? That's still a substantial discount from my initial offer and a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, but I'm still hoping for a bit more. We have 6 rounds left, so there's time to negotiate further. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer than my previous one, but still above Bob's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I'm happy to continue negotiating with you.  $950,000 is a good offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. How about $1,000,000? This seems like a fair compromise, given the significant value this product holds for you. "", ""product_price"": 1000000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, this product would be valuable for me, and $1,000,000 is very tempting.  How about we meet in the middle at $975,000, and we can close the deal? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting very close to my minimum price. I'm confident I can't get a higher price from Bob, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely. Accepting this offer is the best option at this point."
