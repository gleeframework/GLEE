"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm still aiming higher than Bob's offer. There's room to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $12,000 is too low for me. How about we settle on $15,000? It's a fair price that reflects the true value of this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, but I'm still a bit concerned about the cost. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $12,000, which would be $13,500. Would you be willing to accept that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While I could push for more, accepting $13,500 is a solid deal. It's significantly more than my minimum and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
