"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to make a fair offer of $850,000, a 6.25% premium over its true value to you. This is a limited-time offer, and I'm open to negotiations, but I'm not willing to go below $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum:** You're willing to spend up to $800,000, and her offer is $850,000.
* **You have a fallback option:** You know John will sell you the product for $800,000.

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price. She's stated she won't go below $800,000, but there's a chance she might meet your price rather than lose the sale. If she doesn't budge, you can always buy from John."
