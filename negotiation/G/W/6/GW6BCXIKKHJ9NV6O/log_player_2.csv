"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially get the product for a lower price by continuing to negotiate with Alice.  He has room to negotiate as he's willing to pay up to $12,000 and Alice is willing to sell for as low as $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 is a good starting point.  It's a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $10,000, but it's still above Alice's minimum acceptable price of $8,000. This gives Alice some room to negotiate, but also shows Bob is serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,500 is closer to Bob's target price, it's still not the best deal.  He can likely negotiate further with Alice.  Bob's counteroffer of $9,000 was close to Alice's minimum acceptable price, and she rejected it, which means she's willing to lower her price slightly. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can try to reach a compromise closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly to $9,500.  This shows that he is serious about buying the product from Alice, but is still pushing for a better price. This counteroffer is a good middle ground between Bob's previous offer of $9,000 and Alice's current offer of $10,500."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to Bob's maximum, but it's still not a great deal.  Considering the time and effort spent negotiating, it's likely that further negotiation won't get Alice to drop much lower.  At this point, buying from John for $12,000 is a more efficient and predictable decision.  It avoids further negotiation and ensures a quick purchase."
