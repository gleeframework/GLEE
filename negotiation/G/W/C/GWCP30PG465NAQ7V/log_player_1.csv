Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My minimum acceptable price is $1,000,000.**  I have a guaranteed sale to John at that price, so anything less is a loss for me.
* **Bob's maximum price is $800,000.**  He won't pay more than that.
* **Therefore, the optimal price is somewhere between $800,000 and $1,000,000.** I'm offering $900,000, which is a good compromise. It gives Bob a good deal, but it also ensures that I make a profit.

**Why this strategy is good:**

* **Maximize potential profit:**  I'm aiming for a higher price than Bob's maximum, hoping to get closer to my ideal price.
* **Mitigate risk:** If Bob rejects, I have a guaranteed sale to John, so I'm not taking a huge risk. 
* **Good negotiation practice:**  Offering a reasonable compromise can lead to a successful sale."
