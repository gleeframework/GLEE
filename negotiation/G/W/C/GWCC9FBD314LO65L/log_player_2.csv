{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is way too high. It's time to counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 600000}
``` 

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, dropping the price by almost two-thirds. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying but also that I'm not willing to pay her asking price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'll reject and counteroffer again, hopefully getting closer to a reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly, but still staying well below Alice's price. I'm trying to find a middle ground and see if she's willing to compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is still too high. I'm going to reject and try one more counteroffer before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
```

I'm raising my offer a bit more, trying to get closer to a deal. I'm hoping Alice will see that I'm serious about buying and will come down in price. If this doesn't work, I'll have to consider John's offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Alice's offer is still too high.  I've made several counteroffers and it seems she's not willing to negotiate down to my desired price. At this point, it's more beneficial to secure the product from John at a much lower cost, even if it means ending the negotiation with Alice."
