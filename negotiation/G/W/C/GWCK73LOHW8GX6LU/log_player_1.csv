"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $100.  This is a reasonable starting point, as it's higher than my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While it's my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can do better. I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90.  This is still a decent price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  It also leaves some room for further bargaining if he's not willing to pay that much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While it's only $5 more than what John is offering, it's still a better deal for me than selling to John. It's also worth noting that we've already gone through 4 rounds of negotiation, and there's no guarantee that I'll be able to get a higher price from Bob in the remaining rounds.  It's better to take a sure thing than risk getting nothing at all."
