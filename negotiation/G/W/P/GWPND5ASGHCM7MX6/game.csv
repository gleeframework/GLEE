"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price considering its worth to you is $10,000.",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500, which is still a good deal for you considering your value of $8,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $8,500 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,800. This is still a great price considering its value to you is $10,000.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant at $8,800. How about $8,600? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. ",8600.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,600 is still a bit above your target price, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $8,700. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value to me is $8,000.",8700.0,Alice,5,
