It's becoming clear that Alice is unlikely to budge significantly from her price point.  While we could continue negotiating, we risk the price remaining above our budget, leaving us no choice but to buy from John at $120 anyway.  To avoid potentially wasting more rounds and getting stuck with a worse deal, it's time to cut our losses and go with John's offer."
