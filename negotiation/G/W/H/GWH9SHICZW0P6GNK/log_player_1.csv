Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why not ask for $15,000?**  While $15,000 is the maximum value for me, Bob is only willing to pay $12,000.  There's no chance he'll accept that price.
* **Why $14,000?** This price offers a good compromise. It's a significant profit for me, and it's still within Bob's range of acceptable value.  There's a good chance he'll accept, as he'll be getting a $2,000 discount. 
* **If he rejects:** I'm still guaranteed to get $15,000 from John, so there's no risk in offering a slightly lower price to Bob."
