{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is way too high.  It's above your maximum budget and you can get the same product from John for significantly less. Rejecting the offer allows you to try and negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the maximum price I'm willing to pay, which is the price John is offering. This is a strong starting point for negotiation and puts the pressure on Alice to either accept or make a counteroffer closer to my price."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I will continue negotiating with Alice, aiming to lower the price further. There's still room to bargain, and I don't want to settle for a price that's too close to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still emphasizes that I'm looking for a deal.  It's a reasonable compromise that might be more appealing to Alice than my previous offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, and I'm getting closer to reaching my limit.  However, I'm going to continue negotiating, hoping to get a better deal before I have to buy from John.  I can likely get the price lower with another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer to $1,150,000, which is still lower than Alice's current offer but shows that I'm willing to compromise. This is a last attempt to get a price closer to my maximum budget before considering buying from John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, and we've gone through several rounds of negotiation.  While I could keep trying to get a lower price from Alice, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that she will come down to my price.  At this point, it's more advantageous to buy from John, who is offering the product at my maximum budget, ensuring a successful purchase without further risk of negotiation."
