"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $950,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it, which still leaves you with a healthy profit margin. Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to meet halfway. However, based on the current market conditions and the value proposition of our product, I am unable to accept your offer at $850,000. I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000. This still represents a significant profit for us while considering your budget constraints. I hope this proposal aligns better with your financial plans.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $900,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still a bit more than I can comfortably spend.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000. I believe this offers a fair deal for both of us and ensures a smooth transaction.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. After careful consideration, I am willing to negotiate further. I propose an offer of $890,000 for the product. This price reflects a reasonable compromise between our positions, ensuring a satisfactory outcome for both parties. I look forward to your response.",890000.0,Alice,5,
