"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90.",90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hey Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. How about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $82? I think it's a fair compromise.",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $82 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try $78. This is closer to my budget, and I think it's a fair price considering we're both trying to find a good deal.",78.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $82 is still a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $78. However, I'm willing to make another compromise. How about $81? I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product and the effort I put into it.",81.0,Alice,5,
