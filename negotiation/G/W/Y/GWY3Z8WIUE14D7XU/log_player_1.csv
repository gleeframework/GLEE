Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a price of $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even above its market price."", ""product_price"": 14000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally advisable to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potential concessions. 
* **Anchoring:** By starting at $14,000, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation closer to my desired outcome. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might still be closer to $14,000 than $10,000.
* **Justification:**  While I'm aiming high, I'm providing a reason (""significant value, even above its market price"") to make the offer seem less arbitrary. 

It's important to remember that I have a strong alternative in John, who is ready to buy at my desired price. This allows me to be more assertive in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $10,000 for it. Would you consider adjusting your price accordingly? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is his perceived value of the product, which is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I want to maximize my earnings, accepting a $4,000 loss is not ideal. I'm confident I can negotiate a better deal, especially since I have John as a backup buyer. By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a higher price and am willing to walk away if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true worth. To make this work, I can come down to $13,000. This is a very competitive offer considering the value this product brings."", ""product_price"": 13000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession:** I'm showing flexibility by lowering my price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Smaller Increment:** By reducing the price by $1,000 instead of meeting Bob halfway, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to make a deal and there's limited room for further significant concessions.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value to justify the higher price point. 

This approach aims to find a middle ground while keeping the negotiation moving in a direction favorable to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still feel that $13,000 is slightly too high for me. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12,500. I hope this aligns better with the value you're providing. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $12,500 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. Continuing to negotiate for a potentially small gain ($500) carries the risk of Bob walking away altogether. It's a good business decision to accept a price that's profitable and avoids the potential loss of the sale."
