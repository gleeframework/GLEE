Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm starting with a price of $14,000. This is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation while still reflecting the product's value to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low, and I'm not willing to sell for that price. I'll counter with a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500}
```

I'm offering a price of $12,500. This is a compromise, considering Bob's offer was too low, but still ensures I get a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now at my minimum acceptable price, but I don't see much room for further negotiation.  Selling to John guarantees me my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing a sale by continuing negotiations."
