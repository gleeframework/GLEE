Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I'm confident this product will be a great investment for you.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to be flexible here, but I need to be fair to myself too. $14,000 is my absolute lowest price. This is a great deal on a product you'll benefit from for a long time. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above our target price and John's offer. While Alice is coming down, we need to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However, $14,000 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me at $12,500?  That's a firm offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 12500
}
```

**Reasoning:** 

* **Firmness:**  By saying ""$12,500 is a firm offer,"" we're signaling to Alice that this is our limit. This can encourage her to make a decision.
* **Middle Ground:** We're splitting the difference between her last offer ($14,000) and our previous counteroffer ($12,000), which shows a willingness to compromise but maintains our position. 
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds. Putting a little pressure by being firm might make Alice more amenable."
