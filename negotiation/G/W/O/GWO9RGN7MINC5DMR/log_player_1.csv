"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}

I'm starting with a high offer, close to Bob's perceived value, but leaving room for negotiation. This will hopefully encourage him to counteroffer, allowing me to gauge his interest and potentially close the deal at a good price."

```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum than my initial offer, it's still below my desired price. I want to try and get closer to my target of $11,000. I have several rounds left, so I can still negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price."
