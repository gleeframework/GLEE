Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $950,000. This is a unique product with incredible potential, and I'm confident it will be extremely valuable for you."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as close to $1,000,000 as possible. Since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price, there's no incentive to go lower.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $800,000.  Offering it slightly below his valuation won't entice him.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit. Bob might counter-offer, but I have the leverage of another buyer.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the best possible price from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing the sale to John."
