*  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to negotiate."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

**Reasoning:**

* I'm starting with a counteroffer that's a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within a reasonable range.
* This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal and encourages her to negotiate.
* We're still early in the negotiation process, and I have plenty of rounds left to adjust my offer if necessary."

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* We're in the latter stages of the negotiation with only 3 rounds remaining.
* Alice's offer of $83 is getting closer to my target price of $75, and it's a significant savings compared to buying from John. 
* While I could continue to negotiate, accepting the offer minimizes the risk of a stalemate or a failed negotiation. 
* With 3 rounds left, I can still potentially get a slightly better price if Alice decides to counteroffer again."
