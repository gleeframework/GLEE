Round 3
Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $725,000.

Alice has met your limit. It's unlikely she'll go any lower, and John's offer is the same. Take the deal with Alice."
