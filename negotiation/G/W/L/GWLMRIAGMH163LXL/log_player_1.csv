Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is above my budget.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and allows us to make a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is significantly below what I believe the product is worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true value and the substantial returns you'll gain from it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to pay $1,550,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives us both a reasonable outcome. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is now quite close to my acceptable range, and while I could push for more, there's a risk he'll walk away. Accepting $1,550,000 ensures a profit and avoids potentially losing out on both Bob and John."
