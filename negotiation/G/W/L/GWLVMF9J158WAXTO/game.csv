,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that 150 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering you the product for 130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really benefit from having this product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a little high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $100. It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to get the product within my budget.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're sticking to your original offer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for 125. It's still a good deal for you, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings.",125.0,Alice,5,
