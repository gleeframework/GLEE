Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While $700,000 is lower than my initial offer, it's not quite where I need to be.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000. This price still reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.
