Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your BATNA (Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement):** You can sell the product to John for $800,000. This is your safety net.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects your offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase [product name].  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $950,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while aiming for a significant profit margin.
* **Confident Language:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""fair deal"" emphasize the product's value.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:** Highlighting the ""significant returns"" Bob will gain shifts the focus from the upfront cost to the long-term benefits.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might start slightly lower, but still above your BATNA.
* **Negotiation Style:** Be prepared to justify your price with concrete examples of the product's value. If Bob counters, be ready to negotiate but don't go below your $800,000 safety net."
