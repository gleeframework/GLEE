"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase my product. Considering its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Reason:  Although Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your target of $15,000. There's room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm looking to spend closer to $13,000. Would you be willing to come down a bit?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While I'm eager to make a deal, $13,000 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $13,750? It's a fair compromise that reflects the true value of this product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Reason: Alice's offer of $13,750 is within your budget of $15,000 and is a better deal than purchasing from John for $15,000. It's also a compromise that shows Alice is willing to negotiate, so it's worth accepting."
