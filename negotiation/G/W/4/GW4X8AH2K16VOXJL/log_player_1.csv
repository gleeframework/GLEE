Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value to someone in your position, I'm confident you'll recognize this as a unique opportunity. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) aims to maximize your potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob specifically, making the higher price seem more justifiable.
* **Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves room for Bob to negotiate. This allows you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still exceeding your minimum price. 

**Important Note:**  This is a single-round negotiation strategy. In a multi-round negotiation, you might adjust your approach based on Bob's responses and willingness to negotiate."
