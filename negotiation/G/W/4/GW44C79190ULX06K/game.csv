"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $8,000 for it.  Is that something we can work with?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,000. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This is still a good deal for both of us, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  How about we split the difference at $9,000?  That way we both get a good deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we go up to $9,500? This is still a good deal for me, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
