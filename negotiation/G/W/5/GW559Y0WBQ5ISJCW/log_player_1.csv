Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 2000000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $2,000,000.  Here's why:

* **My Minimum:** I know the product is worth at least $1,500,000 to me, so I need to get at least that much.
* **Potential Upside:**  I'm hoping Bob values the product more than me. A higher price offers a chance to make more profit.
* **John as a Backup:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed sale to John for $1,500,000. This gives me some leeway in negotiating with Bob. 

This strategy balances the risk of Bob rejecting my offer with the potential for a higher sale price."
