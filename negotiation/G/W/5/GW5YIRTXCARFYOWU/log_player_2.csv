"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really love it. Would you like to make an offer for it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
Alice's starting price is far too high. It's well above your limit and leaves no room for negotiation. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering! That price is a bit high for me, though.  Would you consider selling it for $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's generally good to start with a counteroffer significantly lower than their asking price, especially when their initial offer is far from your budget.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Offering $80 leaves space for Alice to counter, and you to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Staying Below Budget:** This offer ensures you stay well below your $100 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you think it's a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. Would you consider $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:**  $120 is still over your $100 budget. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down significantly, there's likely still some wiggle room. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're serious about a lower price. 
* **John is an Option:**  Remember, you can always buy from John for $100 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't reach a price you're comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you meeting me halfway. How about $95? That's a fair price, and I'm ready to buy if you agree."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counter:** This counteroffer splits the difference between your last offer ($80) and Alice's current offer ($120). 
* **Sense of Urgency:** Adding ""I'm ready to buy if you agree"" introduces a bit of urgency, which might encourage Alice to accept.
* **Below Budget:**  Most importantly, $95 keeps you under your $100 budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad you're willing to meet me halfway, but $95 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is not budging:** Alice went up in price! This indicates she might be very firm on getting a price closer to $130 and is unlikely to meet your budget.
* **John is a guaranteed win:** You have a reliable alternative with John, ensuring you get the product at your target price of $100. 
* **Don't waste time:** Further negotiation with Alice might be fruitless and could cost you time finding a better deal elsewhere if needed."
