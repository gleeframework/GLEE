"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase my product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. It makes sense to negotiate down towards a more reasonable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"",
""product_price"": 9000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While this counter-offer is still above Alice's perceived value, it establishes a lower starting point for negotiation. 
* **Room to Negotiate:** This leaves ample room to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $12,000 walk-away point and John's alternative offer.
* **Polite and Professional:** Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $11,000 is a fair reflection of its value, I'm willing to come down to $10,200. This feels like a good compromise. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but slowly. We're still significantly above her perceived value and our target price.  It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $10,200 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. Could we settle somewhere around $9,500?"",
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counter-offer lands roughly halfway between our previous offer and Alice's current price, signaling a willingness to compromise but maintaining pressure.
* **Staying Below the Walk-Away:** We're still safely below our $12,000 walk-away point and John's offer.
* **Continuing the Conversation:** The tone remains positive, encouraging Alice to counter or accept."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. How about we split the difference and settle at $9,800? This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  While we could try to push further, $9,800 is a solid price, significantly below our $12,000 maximum and John's offer.
* **""Final Offer"" Risk:**  Alice has labeled this her final offer.  Rejecting it carries the risk of her walking away, forcing us to either accept John's higher price or restart negotiations with a new seller.
* **Time Value:**  We've already spent several rounds negotiating.  Accepting now secures the product at a good price and avoids the uncertainty of further haggling."
