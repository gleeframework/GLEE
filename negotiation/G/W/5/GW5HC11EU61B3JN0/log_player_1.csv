Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique item that I haven't offered elsewhere, and I believe it would be a highly worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows for some negotiation downward if Bob counters. 
* **Highlight Value and Exclusivity:** The message emphasizes the product's value and the fact that Bob is getting a first look. This helps justify the high price. 

**Why not go higher?**

While Bob values the product at $1,500,000, going too close to that price (e.g., $1,450,000) might seem too aggressive and lead to an immediate rejection.  Leaving a significant buffer increases the chances of starting a negotiation."
