Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $10,000. This is a good starting point as it gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.  I believe Bob might be willing to pay a premium for the product, but I also want to leave myself some room to compromise if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
While $8,000 is my minimum, I believe I can get a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I hope this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept while still giving me a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now below my minimum. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with him, as I could lose even more money. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so that's the best option."
