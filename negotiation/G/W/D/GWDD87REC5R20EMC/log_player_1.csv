Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$1,250,000:** This price is a starting point that allows for negotiation. It's higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and invites negotiation. 

**Reasoning:**

* Starting high is advantageous, but not too high to be immediately rejected.
* Leaving room for negotiation allows for potential profit while still considering Bob's willingness to pay.
* Having John as an alternative buyer provides a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.** Accepting his offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **While John is a backup option at $1,500,000, I'm not ready to sell just yet.** There's potential to negotiate a better price with Bob.

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and try to increase the price.** Even if I don't reach my ideal price, I can still potentially secure a better deal than Bob's current offer.
* **Selling to John is a guaranteed profit, but it's not the most advantageous outcome.** I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,050,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value and my need to cover costs. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$1,150,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise, moving halfway between my previous offer of $1,250,000 and Bob's offer of $1,050,000. 
* **Message:** The message reiterates my understanding of Bob's perspective but emphasizes the product's value and my need to make a profit.

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway shows willingness to compromise, potentially leading to a quicker agreement.**
* **The offer is still above Bob's initial offer, giving me room for further negotiation if needed.**
* **The message maintains a friendly tone, keeping the negotiation open and collaborative.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm confident I can find a product that meets my needs for $1,000,000. However, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for this one if it truly meets my specific requirements.  Let me know if you're willing to come down to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is close to my desired price and significantly higher than his previous offers. Accepting this offer would bring me closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. 
* While I could potentially negotiate further, there's a risk that Bob will walk away, leaving me with the less desirable option of selling to John for $1,500,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Accepting the offer guarantees a significant profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation.**
* **The offer is close enough to my desired price that the potential for a small additional profit during further negotiation is not worth the risk of losing the deal.**
* **Selling to John is a safe option, but it doesn't maximize my potential earnings.**"
