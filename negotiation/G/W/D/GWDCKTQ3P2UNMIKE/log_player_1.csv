Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

Here's why I chose this price:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. This means he has room to pay more than my minimum price of $1,000,000.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering $1,400,000 leaves some space for negotiation. Bob might counter-offer, and we could potentially settle on a price that's closer to his value, but still very favorable for me.
* **John's Value:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I have a guaranteed buyer in John for $1,000,000. This means I can be fairly aggressive with my offer to Bob.

This strategy aims to maximize my profit while still keeping the possibility of a better deal with Bob."
