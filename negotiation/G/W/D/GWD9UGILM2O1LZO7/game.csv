"Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest. I understand your perspective, but $6,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $10,500.  This is a fair offer considering the value this product brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me a bit.  While I do think the product is good, $10,500 is still a bit outside my budget.  How about $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $7,500 is still quite low, but I'm willing to accept $9,500. This is my final offer.",9500.0,Alice,5,
