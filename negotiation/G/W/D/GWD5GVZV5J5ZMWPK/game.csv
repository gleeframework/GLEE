"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your operations. My initial price is $1,000,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let's discuss further.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, considering its value to you and my own budget constraints. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is significantly below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment.  How about we settle on $950,000? This would allow us both to benefit from the deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's split the difference and settle on $900,000. This would ensure a fair deal for both parties.",900000.0,Bob,4,
