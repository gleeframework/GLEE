{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you. I'm asking for $11,500. I'm confident this is a fair price considering its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  My goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $11,500 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate up slightly, but still ensures I get a great deal. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing I have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 with John gives me leverage. I'm not desperate to accept anything less than $10,000."
