My goal is to ensure that both parties benefit from this transaction, and I believe this offer aligns perfectly with that objective.

Please consider my offer carefully, and let me know if you have any questions or require further information. I am here to assist you every step of the way.

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is starting the negotiation at your maximum price. This leaves no room for you to save money. You are better off rejecting her offer and seeing if she'll come down in price.  Since John offers the product at the same price, there's no risk in seeing if Alice will negotiate."
