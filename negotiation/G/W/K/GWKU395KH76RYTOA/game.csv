"Hi Bob, I understand that $15000 might be a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $12500. It's still a great deal considering the product's value and benefits. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9500 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $10750. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal considering the product's value and benefits. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
