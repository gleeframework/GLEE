"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  $500,000 is a good price, but there's potential to save even more.  Let's see if we can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $400,000.  This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, but it's still a reasonable starting point given her initial offer.  Let's see how she responds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Alice has come down to $450,000, which is a good price, but still within my budget. I'd rather not risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate, especially with John's offer looming.  Let's take the deal."
