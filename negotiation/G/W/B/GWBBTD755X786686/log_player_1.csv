``` 

This is my opening offer. I'm starting high, knowing that the product is worth $8,000 to Bob.  I'm hoping to get a good price, but I'm also prepared to negotiate down if necessary.  I'll be watching for his response and will adjust my strategy based on his counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $6,500 is better than nothing, it's still significantly less than what the product is worth to me. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price. I'm hoping to get at least $8,000, but I'm willing to settle for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to get closer to my original price.  How about $8,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's more in line with what I need to get for the product."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $8,500 is closer, I'm still aiming for a lower price. Could we meet in the middle at $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer to get closer to my original asking price, $7,500 is still a decent deal and closer to what Bob is willing to pay.  It's also better than selling to John for $8,000, so I'll accept Bob's offer and close the deal."
