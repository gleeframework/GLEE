"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this excellent product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $22,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to get the product for as close to $8,000 as possible. Alice's initial offer of $22,000 is far too high.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially get a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $22,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is taking a bold step here by making a counteroffer that's considerably lower than Alice's initial price. This strategy is risky but aims to establish a strong negotiation position and potentially get a better deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget limitations, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get for it.  How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is lower than the initial $22,000, it's still significantly higher than Bob's target of $8,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially drive the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $12,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach a compromise."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is slowly but steadily pushing towards his desired price point.  He's demonstrating flexibility by increasing his offer from $10,000 but staying well below Alice's offer. This counteroffer is designed to keep the negotiation going and potentially reach a mutually agreeable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $12,000 is still a bit too low for me to feel comfortable. How about we split the difference again and settle on $15,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's desired price point, $15,000 is still outside of his comfortable range. Bob can continue to negotiate, hoping to get the price down further. He has enough rounds remaining to explore lower offers and potentially reach a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to go up to $13,000. This is my final offer, and it's the most I can afford.  Let me know if you're willing to accept it."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his limit, but he's still trying to negotiate. He's making a clear statement that this is his final offer, hoping to put pressure on Alice to accept. The offer is $2,000 higher than his previous offer, showing willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget constraints."
