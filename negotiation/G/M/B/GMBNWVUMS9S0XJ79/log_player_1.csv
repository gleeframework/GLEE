Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth and my budget.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","This is a good offer and getting very close to my absolute floor. It's time to decide if I want to push for a bit more or take the guaranteed offer from John. 

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Bob might still be willing to go a bit higher, it's unlikely to be significant at this point. Accepting John's offer for $1,500,000 guarantees a strong profit without the risk of Bob walking away.  It's always possible Bob would have gone higher, but sometimes a sure thing is the best option."
