"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, I'm hoping to find a price that works a little better for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our initial offer and your counteroffer. I'll offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a very competitive price, and I think it's a fair compromise. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,3,
