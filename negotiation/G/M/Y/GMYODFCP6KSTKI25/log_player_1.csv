Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a valuable piece and I believe this price reflects its worth.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but significantly lower than my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message emphasizes that I'm open to discussing the price.
* **John as Leverage:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so I'm not desperate for Bob's deal. 
* **Strategic Thinking:** I'm aiming to find the highest price point where Bob is still willing to buy, while ensuring I get closer to my target."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $950,000 I'm aiming for.
* **Negotiation Potential:** I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards. I'm not desperate to sell at this price, as I have John as a backup.
* **Strategic Counteroffer:** I can counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than Bob's, signaling my willingness to compromise. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain leverage and try to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $925,000.  This would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous offer and Bob's.
* **Positive Language:** I'm using positive language (""feeling good"") to emphasize that I'm trying to find a solution that benefits both of us.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  My counteroffer is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, demonstrating my willingness to negotiate but not to cave in.

This counteroffer allows me to test the waters and see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway. If he rejects again, I can consider either lowering my price further or moving on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $925,000. I'd like to make another offer of $875,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $875,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Limited Negotiation Space:**  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a result closer to my minimum, as he is stubbornly sticking to his price point.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum target price.

Given the circumstances, it's more beneficial to sell to John and secure a guaranteed $1,000,000 than to risk further negotiation with Bob, who is unwilling to meet my price expectations."
