Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's value for the product. This gives me some room to negotiate if he counters. I'm also aware that I can always sell to John for $150, so I'm not risking too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's lower than my minimum value for the product. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm counteroffering at $160.  This is still above Bob's initial offer, but it's closer to my minimum value and gives him a chance to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $140 is better than my minimum price of $150 and is close to John's offer of $150.  This is a good deal for me and I'll accept it."
