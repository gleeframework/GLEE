"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll really appreciate its value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fantastic deal, considering its worth to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is significantly less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and the price John offers ($1,500,000). Accepting this offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
