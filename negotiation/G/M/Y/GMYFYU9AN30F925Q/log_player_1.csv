Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its unique features and benefits, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally wise to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the message doesn't explicitly state why the price is above Bob's perceived value, it emphasizes the product's worth. This aims to subtly shift Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Alternative:**  Bob knows you have an alternative buyer, but the fact that you're approaching him first suggests the product might be more suited to his needs or that you see him as a preferred buyer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  You know your walk-away price is $12,000 (John's offer), which gives you some bargaining power."
