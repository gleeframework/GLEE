"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll see the value it brings.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Opening High:** Starting with a price of $1,200,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than Bob's perceived value.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the value and potential benefits of the product for Bob can encourage him to consider the offer.
* **Room for Compromise:** The initial offer is not too extreme, allowing for both parties to find a mutually agreeable price through negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $500,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000 and far below the initial offer of $1,200,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is not acceptable, it does demonstrate his interest.  There is still potential to negotiate a better price.
* **Maintaining Value:** Accepting Bob's offer would result in a substantial loss for me. It's crucial to maintain my value and pursue a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $500,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:** My counteroffer of $900,000 demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum acceptable price. It's a significant compromise from my initial offer.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  The message emphasizes that the offer is a good deal for both of us, highlighting the potential value and the compromise I've made. 
* **Clear and Concise:** I've stated a clear price point and communicated the rationale behind it, making it easier for Bob to understand and respond."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer Still Too Low:**  $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's closer to my counteroffer, it's not a viable option.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to maintain my position and continue negotiating for a higher price. 
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price from Bob. He has shown interest, and I can continue to present counteroffers that bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This product will be worth more than that to you in the long run, and it gives me a reasonable return on my investment."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This offer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous counteroffer of $900,000 and Bob's current offer of $700,000.
* **Highlighting Value:**  I emphasize the product's value to Bob and remind him that it will be a worthwhile investment. This is an attempt to make him more willing to increase his offer.
* **Finality:** While I'm willing to compromise further, this offer is getting close to my lower limit.  It shows Bob that I am serious about making a deal, but I won't go much lower."
