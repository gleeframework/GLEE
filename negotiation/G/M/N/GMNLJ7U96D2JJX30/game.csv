"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll see the value it brings.  Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $500,000 is simply too far below what this product is worth. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this worthwhile for me.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? I believe that's a fair offer.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $700,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  This product will be worth more than that to you in the long run, and it gives me a reasonable return on my investment.",850000.0,Alice,5,
