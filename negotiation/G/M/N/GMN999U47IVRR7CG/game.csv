"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows both of us to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle at $1,300,000. This price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,300,000 is still a little lower than what I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $1,325,000. This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a valuable asset for your business.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference and finalize this at $1,312,500. This would be a fair compromise and allow us both to close this deal.",1312500.0,Bob,6,
