"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000? This gives us both a fair deal, and I'm confident the product will be worth every penny to you.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,050,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to go down a bit further, but $1,050,000 is still too low.  How about we settle on $1,100,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure you'll find the product to be a valuable asset.  Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still a bit above my target. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,070,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1070000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,090,000. I'd like to make a slightly lower offer of $1,060,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1060000.0,Bob,8,
