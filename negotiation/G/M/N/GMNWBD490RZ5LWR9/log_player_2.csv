"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $90. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  $90 seems a bit steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
``` 

This counter offer aims to:

* **Start low:** Beginning significantly below our maximum allows room for negotiation.
* **Be polite:**  Maintaining a positive tone encourages continued discussion.
* **Show interest:**  We express that the price is the main barrier, not a lack of desire for the product."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $65. How about $77.50? It's a great price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $77.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $77.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is moving in the right direction, $77.50 is still above our target price and too close to John's offer. We'll reject to signal that further negotiation is needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $70? That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're suggesting a price directly between our last offer ($65) and her current one ($77.50). This common negotiation tactic can signal fairness.
* **Firm but Fair:**  We're holding firm to our desire for a lower price while acknowledging her willingness to compromise. 
* **Approaching the Limit:** We're getting closer to our walk-away point ($80 with John).  Alice will need to make a significant move soon if she wants to secure the sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, this time between $77.50 and $70. How about $73.75? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $73.75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73.75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're now in a pattern of diminishing returns. Alice is conceding very small amounts, and we're getting too close to John's price. By rejecting this offer, we signal that the next counter-offer needs to be much closer to $70 to be worthwhile. We risk her walking away, but the potential savings are now minimal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $73.75 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $71, that's my final offer."",
""product_price"": 71
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** We're explicitly stating this is our best offer, putting the pressure on Alice.
* **Small Concession:** We're still showing a willingness to move, but only slightly. 
* **Above John, Below Alice:** Our offer remains more appealing than John's while staying below Alice's desired price point. 

**Outcome:**

This strategy creates a clear decision point for Alice. It's likely our last chance for a discount, but it risks her walking away entirely."
