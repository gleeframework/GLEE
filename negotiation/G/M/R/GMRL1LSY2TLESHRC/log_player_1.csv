"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering its value and the market conditions. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Justifying the Price:** I'm framing it as a ""fair"" price, appealing to Bob's sense of reason and potential for a win-win.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm not pushing for my full $1,200,000 value immediately, allowing for potential counteroffers. 
* **Setting the Stage:** This initial offer sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum acceptable price.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is running out:**  I only have 2 rounds left.
* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price:**  $915,000 is significantly lower than my desired $1,200,000.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  I'm confident that John will buy the product for $1,200,000, securing me a much better deal than Bob's offer.

It's not ideal to walk away from the negotiation, but with limited time remaining and a guaranteed deal with John, it's the most financially sensible option."
