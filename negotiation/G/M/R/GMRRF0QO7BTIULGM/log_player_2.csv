"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's too risky to accept at this point.  Rejecting and counteroffering allows for negotiation and potentially a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that is significantly lower than Alice's initial price but still within a reasonable range. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while also setting a clear boundary.  It's important to leave some room for further negotiation, but also to avoid being overly aggressive in the first counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget.  I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating to try and get a lower price.  While John's offer is tempting, there's still potential to save even more with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has shown a willingness to come down in price. This counteroffer is a compromise, bridging the gap between my previous offer and Alice's current offer.  It demonstrates a commitment to negotiation without completely abandoning my initial goal of a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my maximum budget, but it's still not ideal.  I'm going to reject it and continue negotiating.  There's still a chance to get a better price, and I don't want to settle for a deal that's too close to my maximum limit.  I'm not ready to buy from John yet, as I believe I can still get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate and has shown flexibility in her offers.  This counteroffer is my maximum budget and represents a strong push for a deal.  By offering my top price, I'm signaling my seriousness while also leaving room for a slight compromise if Alice is still hesitant.  If Alice accepts, I get the product at my maximum price.  If she rejects, it's time to consider John's offer as the negotiation might not yield a better result."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is only $25,000 above my maximum budget. This is a small enough difference that it's worth accepting.  Continuing to negotiate might result in a lower price, but there's a risk of reaching an impasse and having to settle for John's offer.  Given that we're nearing the end of the rounds, accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product while staying close to my budget."
