"Alice, your offer is far too high. Given my budget and the product's market value, I'm willing to pay $1,200,000. This reflects a fair price for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product extends beyond typical market valuations. Its unique features and potential warrant a higher price.  I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still too high for me. My initial offer of $1,200,000 remains my maximum, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us given the product's potential and the market value. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I must be candid: if we can't find common ground closer to my previous offer, I'll need to explore other options for selling this product. I'm open to a reasonable compromise, but $1,200,000 significantly undervalues what I'm offering. Let's make this work â€“ are you willing to consider a figure closer to $1,800,000?",1800000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you have a business to run, and I respect your perspective. However, I remain committed to my initial offer of $1,200,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget constraints.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
