"Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find common ground.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm open to finding a solution. To move this forward, could you stretch your budget to $1,300,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the value of the product.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to bridge the gap and get this deal done.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer - I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, $1,300,000 is really the lowest I can go for the product alone.  However, I'm wondering if there's something more I can offer to make this deal work for you. Perhaps there are additional services, support options, or other aspects of the product I haven't fully explained that would make a difference? Tell me what would make you more comfortable with that $1,300,000 price point.",1300000.0,Alice,5,
