"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This provides room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price, even though I haven't explicitly stated what the product is. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone remains collaborative (""find a price that benefits both of us"") to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly his perceived value, which isn't surprising.  While I could sell to John right now and break even, there's still room to negotiate with Bob and potentially get a better price than $800,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm open to finding a solution. To move this forward, could you stretch your budget to $1,300,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the value of the product."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledging Bob:** I want to maintain a positive negotiation environment and recognize Bob's willingness to engage.
* **Significant Drop, But Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer drops substantially from my initial price but remains well above both Bob's offer and my absolute minimum. 
* **Justification:** I'm implying there's limited flexibility on my end, but I'm phrasing it as ""recognizing the value"" to subtly shift focus away from my own position.
* **Encouraging Movement:** Asking Bob to ""stretch his budget"" aims to encourage him to increase his offer substantially in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to bridge the gap and get this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Positive Trend, But Not There Yet:** Bob is clearly willing to negotiate, and his offer has increased significantly. However, $950,000 is still substantially below my $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Time for a Different Tactic:** Simply going back and forth with counteroffers might not be the most effective strategy at this point. I need to understand Bob's hesitations better or explore if there are other elements of value I can offer.  I'll use the next round to probe further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer - I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, $1,300,000 is really the lowest I can go for the product alone.  However, I'm wondering if there's something more I can offer to make this deal work for you. Perhaps there are additional services, support options, or other aspects of the product I haven't fully explained that would make a difference? Tell me what would make you more comfortable with that $1,300,000 price point."",
""product_price"": 1300000 
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Anchoring and Holding Firm:**  I'm reiterating my $1,300,000 price as a firm anchor, signaling that I'm unlikely to budge much from this point.
* **Shifting Focus to Value:** Instead of just haggling on price, I'm pivoting to explore additional value propositions. This could uncover hidden needs or interests Bob has that I can address, making the deal more attractive.
* **Seeking Information:** By asking Bob what would make him ""comfortable,"" I'm trying to understand his underlying concerns or objections to the higher price. This information will help me tailor my approach in subsequent rounds."
