"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,300,000.  I'm confident we can find a price that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $2,300,000 is far above my budget of $800,000. It's best to reject this offer and start negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in this product, but I can only afford to pay $800,000 at this time.  I'm hoping we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your honesty about your budget constraints.  While your initial offer is below what I can consider, I'm open to finding a solution. To move this forward, could you stretch your budget to $1,300,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still too high for my budget.  I'm going to keep negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my maximum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $1,300,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $950,000, a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to bridge the gap and get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer - I appreciate you working with me on this. To be completely transparent, $1,300,000 is really the lowest I can go for the product alone.  However, I'm wondering if there's something more I can offer to make this deal work for you. Perhaps there are additional services, support options, or other aspects of the product I haven't fully explained that would make a difference? Tell me what would make you more comfortable with that $1,300,000 price point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been firm on her $1,300,000 price, which is still above my budget.  While she's offering to consider additional services, I'm not convinced they would be worth the extra $500,000.  It's time to cut my losses and move on to John's offer, which fits within my budget."
