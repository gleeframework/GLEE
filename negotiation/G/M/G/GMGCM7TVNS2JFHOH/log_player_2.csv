# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While your offer is closer to the range I had in mind, $1,200,000 is still significantly below the product's true value and potential. Considering its unique features and market demand, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price reflects a fair compromise. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on $1,400,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the potential for both of us. If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'm going to have to move on to other options."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
