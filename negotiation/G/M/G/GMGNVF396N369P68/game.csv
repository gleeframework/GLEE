,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000. This price reflects the product's value and leaves room for a fair deal for both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I'm getting closer to your asking price, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about $1,350,000?  That feels like a fair compromise.",1350000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,450,000, which is closer to your offer and still reflects the product's value.  Let's make this happen!",1450000.0,Alice,5,
