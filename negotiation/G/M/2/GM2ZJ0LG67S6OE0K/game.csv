"Hi Alice, thanks for offering this product. I'm interested, but $20,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I see your point, $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I could let it go for.  Could you do $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I understand it's a good product, but $17,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500?",13500.0,Bob,4,
