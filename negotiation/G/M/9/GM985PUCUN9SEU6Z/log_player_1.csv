"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $85?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. Although he's willing to pay more than John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $95."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $87. While it's not my ideal price, it's still above my minimum and better than selling to John."
