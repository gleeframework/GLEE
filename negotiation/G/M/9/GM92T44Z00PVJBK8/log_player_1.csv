Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a decent markup from my minimum value of $120, giving me some room to negotiate. It also gives Bob a clear idea that I'm serious about getting a good price for the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for such a significant loss. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm lowering my price to $130.  This is still a good profit for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to compromise. It also keeps the negotiation moving forward without giving away too much value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum. I'm not willing to sell at such a loss.  I'll reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm lowering the price to $110.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but it's still a profit for me.  This is my last offer before I go with John's $120 offer. I hope Bob sees that we're close to an agreement and accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not willing to come up to a price that is acceptable to me.  While I'd prefer to make more than $120, John's offer is a guaranteed sale, and I'm not going to keep negotiating with Bob when a sure thing is available."
