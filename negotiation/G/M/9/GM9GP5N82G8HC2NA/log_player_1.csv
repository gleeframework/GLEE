{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, as you know this product is worth $1,000,000 to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $950,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, so you're already in a good position.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still a $50,000 gap between your offer and Bob's perceived value, allowing for some negotiation.
* **It shows you're serious:** By offering a price close to the value, it shows Bob you're willing to make a deal and are not just playing games.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand that the product is valuable to both of us, but I believe we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to $750,000? This would still allow me to acquire the product at a reasonable cost while respecting its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I'm not willing to sell for that amount, so I will reject his offer. I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is simply too low for me. I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to negotiate, but I need to get at least $850,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's aim for a price in the middle, and we can both walk away happy.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

Here's why I'm going with this counteroffer:

* **It's firm but fair:**  $850,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to him. It's also a significant increase from his initial offer, showing him I'm not going to back down easily.
* **It leaves room for compromise:**  We're now in a more realistic range for both of us, with a gap of $150,000 to work with. 
* **It keeps the negotiation going:** By making a counteroffer, we keep the conversation open and show Bob that I'm serious about getting a fair price. 

Let's see if this counteroffer gets us closer to a deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $850,000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still looking for a price closer to $800,000. This would better align with the value I place on the product. Would you be open to discussing this further? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.
