"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will reject it. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially start a negotiation. It's also important to remember that I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to risk continuing the negotiation, hoping to reach a more favorable price. I can always sell to John for $10,000 if the negotiation with Bob fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly, but still staying above Bob's initial offer. This shows flexibility while demonstrating my willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a price that is acceptable to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000.  I'm willing to accept this offer and close the deal, as continuing to negotiate risks losing the sale and having to settle for John's $10,000."
