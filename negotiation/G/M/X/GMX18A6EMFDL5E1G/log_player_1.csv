Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, I should aim higher with Bob. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $19,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Gauge Interest:**  The message is framed to gauge Bob's interest and potentially start a conversation that could lead to a sale."
