Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,500,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly higher than my minimum acceptable value. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  Although I'm starting to feel the pressure of the limited rounds,  $1,150,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to risk another round to see if I can get closer to my desired price. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
