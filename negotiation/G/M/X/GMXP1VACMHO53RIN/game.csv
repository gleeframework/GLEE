"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth at least $10,000 to you.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but $12,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $8,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. That's still a great value for you, considering the product is worth $10,000 to you. Let's close this deal.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $9,250?",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting close to my limit here. How about we split the difference and go with $9,750? That's a fair price for both of us, and it lets us close this deal.",9750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, you're right, we are getting close.  I'd be happy to close the deal at $9,500.  This gives us both a little bit of a win.",9500.0,Bob,6,
