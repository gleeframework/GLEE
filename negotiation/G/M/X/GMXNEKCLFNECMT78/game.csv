"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,150,000. I'm confident this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to stay within my budget of $1,200,000.",1075000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,075,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer is more reflective of that. How about we meet in the middle at $1,110,000?",1110000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,075,000 and $1,110,000, which would be $1,092,500. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement here.",1092500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $1,092,500 is cutting it a little too close. How about we settle at $1,100,000 even? It's a strong offer, and I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short of my budget with your latest offer. I'm willing to go up to $1,095,000, but no more. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle here.",1095000.0,Bob,6,
