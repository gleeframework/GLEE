{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Explanation:**

The product is worth $100 to you, and Alice's offer is $150. This is significantly more than your maximum budget. It makes sense to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $80. This is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $150.  It's also below my maximum budget of $100, leaving some room for negotiation. I'm hoping Alice will be willing to come down a bit to close the deal."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is lower than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget of $100.  I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a lower price.  I still have rounds left, and there's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $95. This is still within my budget, but it shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product. I'm hoping that by demonstrating a willingness to meet her halfway, she'll be more likely to accept my offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $115 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'm going to try one more counteroffer to see if I can get Alice to lower the price further. If she rejects my counteroffer, I'll buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Explanation:**

This is my final offer.  It's my maximum budget and I'm hoping Alice will accept it. If she rejects, I'll move on to John as I'm not willing to pay more."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is not willing to budge on her price. Even though she's come down from her initial offer, it's still above my maximum budget. I'm running out of rounds, and it's not worth risking getting stuck with a higher price. I'm going to go with the safe option and buy the product from John for $100."
