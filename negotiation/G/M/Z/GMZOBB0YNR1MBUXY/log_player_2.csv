"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first.  Given its value, I think a price of $11,500 is very fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a better price than John's $12,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Given my budget, $11,000 is the highest I can go right now.  Would you be willing to consider that?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a bit too low for me.  Could you meet me halfway at $11,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still lower than John's price:** $11,250 is less than $12,000, making it a better deal for Bob.
* **The negotiation is moving closer to Bob's desired price:** Alice has come down from $11,500 to $11,250, indicating a willingness to compromise. 
* **Further negotiation might not be worth the time:** While Bob could try for a lower price, it's possible Alice will be firm at $11,250.  Accepting avoids the risk of Alice walking away from the deal entirely."
