"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $120 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $147.50? That way we both get a good deal.",147.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $147.50 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $130? I'm really interested in the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to stay within my budget.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $130 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $138.75?  I'm sure we can find a way to make this work for both of us.",138.75,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $138.75 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about $125? I'm really interested in the product and I think we can find a mutually beneficial price.",125.0,Bob,6,
