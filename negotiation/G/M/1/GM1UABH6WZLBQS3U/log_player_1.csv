{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $11,500. I think it would be a valuable addition for you, and this is a great deal."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $12,000, I want to see if Bob will pay a higher price first, maximizing potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate or feel like he's getting a deal if he accepts the initial offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $11,500 is significantly above Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still attractive compared to me selling it elsewhere. It gives him a reason to consider the offer seriously. 
 
**Important Note:** There's a risk Bob will reject this offer. However, it's a calculated risk to potentially earn an extra $1,500."
