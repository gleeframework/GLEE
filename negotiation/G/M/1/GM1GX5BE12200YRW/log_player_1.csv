Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have leverage to start high. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a significant profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation. If Bob counters, you can always come down, knowing your minimum acceptable price is $1,200,000."
