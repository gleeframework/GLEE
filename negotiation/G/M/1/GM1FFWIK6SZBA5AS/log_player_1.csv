"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This gives me some room to negotiate downwards if necessary. It's also a reasonable starting point considering the product is worth at least $100 to me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's the minimum I'm willing to accept, I'm hoping I can get a bit more.  I still have 8 rounds left, and I'm confident I can negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}

I'm counteroffering with $125. This is still a reasonable price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."

I'm counteroffering with $115. This is a small concession from my previous offer, but it shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal. With only 5 rounds remaining, I need to start closing the gap."
