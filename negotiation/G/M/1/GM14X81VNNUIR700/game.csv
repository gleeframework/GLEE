"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. While I'm interested in the product, $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $80 for it.  What do you think?",80.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $125, which is the lowest I'm comfortable with. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $125 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  It's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I've already gone down to $125, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. How about we meet at $115? It's still a good compromise, and I think it's a fair price for the product.",115.0,Alice,5,
