"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  Would you be willing to do $120? ",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $120. How about we meet in the middle at $135? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me in the middle, but $135 is still a bit outside of my budget.  How about $125?  I'm really interested in this product and I think we can find a price that works for both of us.",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is still a bit of a stretch for you. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $130? I'm really close to accepting your offer, and I think this is a fair compromise.",130.0,Alice,5,
