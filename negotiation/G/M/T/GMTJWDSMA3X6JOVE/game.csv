"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer but that's a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $60.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. I'm willing to make a counteroffer to you. I'm thinking of a price of $90. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the counteroffer, but $90 is still a bit steep for my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. However, I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $85. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, this is getting close to what I can afford.  I could go up to $78, but that's really my limit.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $78 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $78. I'm thinking of a price of $81.5. It's a bit higher than your offer, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",81.5,Alice,7,
