Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's value to you (Alice), the message implies it's worth a significant amount.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is not demanding but rather invites Bob to share his perspective, making it clear that you're open to discussing the price.

By offering the product at $15,000, Alice leaves room to potentially:

* **Negotiate down to $13,500-$14,000:**  Still earning a profit above her minimum.
* **Accept Bob's rejection:** Knowing she has a guaranteed sale at $12,000 from John."
