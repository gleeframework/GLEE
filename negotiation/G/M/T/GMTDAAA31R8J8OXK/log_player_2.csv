Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to make a serious offer. However, I was hoping to get a bit closer to my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's a significant discount from my initial offer. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is still a bit high, but her offer is closer to my target price.  I'm going to reject it and try to negotiate a lower price in the next round.  I still have some room to bargain."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $950,000, which is a significant step closer to your previous offer. Let's see if we can bridge the gap and finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a mutually beneficial deal. However, I still need to make a profit, and $950,000 is a bit short of what I'm looking for. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need a bit more. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,050,000 is still higher than my ideal price, it's getting closer to my target of $1,500,000.  Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  If I reject it, I risk losing the deal entirely and having to buy from John at a significantly higher price.  It's better to accept and save a substantial amount compared to buying from John."
