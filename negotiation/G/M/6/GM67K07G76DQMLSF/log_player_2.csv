"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a very fair price.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing it further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While $120 is cheaper than John's $150, Alice's message hints that she might be willing to go lower.  She's emphasizing the product's value to you, suggesting room for negotiation."
