"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,750,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product.  It's a fair price given its value and my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,400,000 is significantly below my minimum selling price. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I'm compensated fairly for the product's value.  How about $1,600,000? This would allow us to both reach a mutually beneficial agreement.

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm prepared to offer $1,500,000, which reflects the product's value and my budget.  It's a fair price for both of us. Let's close this deal.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
