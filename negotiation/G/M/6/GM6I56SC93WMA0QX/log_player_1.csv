Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is higher than your minimum acceptable price ($100) but still lower than Bob's perceived value ($120). This leaves room for negotiation while maximizing your potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $110 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $100, and it's likely that further negotiation might lead to a lower price. It's better to secure the sale at this price than to risk further negotiation and possibly ending up with a lower price or even selling to John for $100."
