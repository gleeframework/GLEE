"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $15,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Round 2

{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I'm interested in the product, $15,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'd be happy to offer $10,500.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your position, but $15,000 is really my starting point. How about we meet in the middle at $13,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $13,500 is still too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $11,500. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11500}
