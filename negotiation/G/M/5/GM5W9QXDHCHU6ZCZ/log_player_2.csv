"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's starting price is too high. It's above my maximum budget and above what John is offering. I need to negotiate for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for showing me the product, Alice. It looks nice, but $120 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $80?"", ""product_price"": 80}
``` 

I'm starting with a significantly lower offer than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a price well below my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $80 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $95 is still more than I want to pay when I can get it for $100 from John. I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm willing to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm trying to nudge the price closer to my target while still leaving some room for negotiation. This offer is attractive enough that Alice might accept it, but I'm also prepared to walk away if she doesn't budge."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I like the spirit of compromise, Bob! However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $90. How about we try $92 instead? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is clearly trying to find a compromise, and $92 is a reasonable price. It's close enough to my target and significantly less than John's offer. There's not much point in continuing to haggle over a few dollars."
