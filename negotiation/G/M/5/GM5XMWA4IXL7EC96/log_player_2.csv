# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to be extremely valuable. I'm confident it's worth at least $1500000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a lower price. I believe it could be even more valuable to you.  I'm offering it to you for $2000000. This is a significant opportunity, so please consider it carefully. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who is willing to pay $1500000.
