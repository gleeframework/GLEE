"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $180. I think you'll find it's a great deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

The product is worth more to Alice ($150) than it is to me ($120). Alice's offer of $180 is too high. I will reject and make a counteroffer."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $180 is already a very competitive price. Could you meet me halfway at $160?

Alice is still offering a price higher than I'm willing to pay. I'll reject her offer and make a counteroffer again."
