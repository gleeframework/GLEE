"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its unique value proposition, I'm asking for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects its significant worth.  What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her product valuation, it's still significantly higher than your maximum budget and what John offers. Rejecting this offer opens the door for further negotiation with Alice or allows you to purchase from John at a much lower price."
