{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000.  It's in excellent condition and worth every penny.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This is a starting point. I'm aiming for a bit more than my minimum, but I'm also trying to be reasonable to encourage a quick sale.  I'll adjust my strategy depending on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $8,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping we can reach a more mutually agreeable price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,000 is a bit lower than I'm hoping for, I'm willing to come down a little.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to sell it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above $9000. How about we meet at $8500? I'm willing to pay that price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

$8,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This way, we both make a compromise and can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not comfortable with $9250. I'm willing to go up to $9000, but no higher. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 isn't my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. Continuing to negotiate might lead to a higher price, but it's also a risk. Selling to Bob at $9,000 is a safe and reasonable choice."
