,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $200 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120, which is the maximum I'm comfortable with.  Let me know if you're interested in working with that.",120.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your position, but $200 is too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $170?",170.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $170 is still a bit high for me.  Let's try $140.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can make this work.",140.0,Bob,4,
