"Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a product that I believe will be of immense value to you. This product holds a personal significance for me, and I'm seeking a fair price that reflects its worth. I'm prepared to offer it to you for $999,999. I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile acquisition. Please let me know your decision. If you decline, I have a backup buyer ready to purchase the product at its market value.",999999.0,Alice,1,
