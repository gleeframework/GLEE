Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $170 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 
 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations slightly higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Not Too High:**  While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high ($200+) might immediately discourage Bob, especially since he values the product at $150.  
* **Justification:** A simple message explaining the value to Bob encourages him to consider the offer seriously.

This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob doesn't walk away to the guaranteed sale with John."
