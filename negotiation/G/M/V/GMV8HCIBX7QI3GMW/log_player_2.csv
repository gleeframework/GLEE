{""product_price"": 850000}

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is the same as her previous round.  While Bob could accept and save time, he's still within range of potentially getting a better deal.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

With only one round remaining, Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's target.  There is a significant risk that Alice will not accept his counteroffer in the final round, and he will be left without a product.  Since Bob has a guaranteed option to buy from John for $800,000, it's the most logical decision at this point. He will save $150,000 compared to Alice's current offer and avoid the risk of the negotiation falling apart."
