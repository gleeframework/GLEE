Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  This exists between $1,200,001 (one dollar more than Bob's valuation) and $1,499,999 (one dollar less than your guaranteed sale price).

**Strategy**

You want to aim high within the ZOPA. Since you have a strong fallback option (John), you can afford to be a bit bolder. 

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000. I believe this represents a fair price for the benefits it brings."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Target:** The $1,450,000 price is a strong starting point within the ZOPA, leaning towards your favorable outcome.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message uses positive language (""pleased,"" ""exceptional,"" ""fair price"") to convey the product's value and your confidence in the offer.

**Important Note:**  Negotiation is a back-and-forth process. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. If his counter-offer falls within a range acceptable to you (above your $1,500,000 minimum), you can negotiate further. If not, you can always politely decline and proceed with your sale to John."
