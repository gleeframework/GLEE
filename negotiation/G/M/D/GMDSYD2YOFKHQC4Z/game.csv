"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $10,000 for it. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product has a lot of value to offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $14,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $14,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Could you do $11,000? That would work much better for me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $13,000. I think this is the lowest I can go and still make it worth my while.",13000.0,Alice,5,
