"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a great deal on this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite close to your maximum budget. There is a good chance to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. Could you do $7,000?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  Negotiation often benefits from a slightly lower starting point. This leaves room for both parties to move towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Polite and Direct:** The message is polite, acknowledging Alice's offer, but also directly states the desired price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By aiming for $7,000, I'm positioning myself closer to Alice's potential profit margin while still leaving space for counteroffers."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're interested in the product, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, though. How about $8,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice met me in the middle, there's still a potential $1,500 difference between her offer and my ideal price. 
* **Limited Rounds:** With several rounds remaining, I can apply a bit more pressure.
* **John as Backup:**  I can always fall back on John's offer if negotiations stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on this, Alice. How about we split the difference at $8,000?  It's a fair price, and we can both walk away happy."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Direct but Fair:**  I'm directly proposing what we know is Alice's break-even price. This shows I'm serious about buying while aiming for the best possible deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** By ""splitting the difference,"" I'm introducing a sense of urgency and implying this is a strong offer.
* **Win-Win Framing:** Highlighting a mutually beneficial outcome (""walk away happy"") encourages Alice to agree."
