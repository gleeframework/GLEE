Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $140 is a strong starting point. It's significantly more than Bob's perceived value ($80) but leaves me room to negotiate downwards slightly if needed while still making a profit. 
* **Clear Communication:** The message is concise and directly presents the offer without revealing my minimum acceptable price. 
 
This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while still having the safety net of John's offer."
