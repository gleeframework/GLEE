{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product that I know you'll love. I'm offering it to you for $9,500. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's a fair starting point:** It's a bit below my minimum value but leaves room for negotiation.
* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but it's still within a reasonable range.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a more dynamic negotiation process. 

I'm also keeping John in mind - if Bob rejects my offer, I can always go back to John and get my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I would like to get as much money as possible for the product, Bob's offer is far below my minimum value of $10,000. Selling to John is a safe option, but I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob.  I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand you're looking for a good deal. While $8,500 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's last offer. This shows I'm willing to compromise, while still getting closer to my desired price. It's also a reasonable price considering the product's value to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above $8,000. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'd be happy to make a decision at that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'm getting closer to my minimum value, Bob's offer is still below $9,000. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $9,000 at this point.  I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $8,750 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to compromise one last time. Let's settle on $9,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be very happy with the product. This is my final offer, let me know if you accept."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

This offer:

* **Maintains my lower boundary:**  I'm not willing to go below $9,000, so this is my final offer. 
* **Highlights compromise:** I've already moved closer to Bob's desired price.
* **Emphasizes the value:** I'm reminding Bob about the value of the product and how it's a good deal for him. 

I'm hoping this will convince Bob to accept my offer. If he rejects it, I will go to John and sell the product for $10,000."
