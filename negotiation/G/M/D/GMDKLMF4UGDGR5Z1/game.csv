"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I can't go as low as $80.  How about we meet in the middle at $130?",130.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $130 is still a bit too steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $95? That's a fair offer, considering John is offering it for $100.",95.0,Bob,4,
