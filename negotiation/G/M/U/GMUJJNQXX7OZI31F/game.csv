"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1500000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1200000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. While I'm willing to negotiate,  $1200000 is still significantly below the product's true value.  Let's split the difference.  I'm offering you the product for $1350000. This price reflects the potential value you stand to gain, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  I'm confident you'll see the value in this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're going in circles. While I appreciate your persistence,  $1250000 is still a long way from what this product is truly worth. However, to demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm willing to lower my price one last time.  My final offer is $1287500. If you're serious about this deal, now is the time to make a decision. I'm not willing to go any lower.",1287500.0,Alice,7,
