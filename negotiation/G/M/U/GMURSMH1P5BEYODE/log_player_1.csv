"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. I think this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still within a range that might be negotiable. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** The initial offer leaves room for a potential counteroffer from Bob, allowing for a back-and-forth to find a mutually acceptable price.
* **Avoiding John's offer immediately:**  While John is willing to pay my minimum, it's strategically better to exhaust negotiations with Bob first. If Bob rejects, I can always switch to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $13,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting it would result in a significant loss for me.
* **More room for negotiation:**  Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to my minimum.
* **John is still an option:**  While I want to exhaust negotiations with Bob first, I still have the option of selling to John if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $13,000 is below my minimum. I'm willing to come down to $16,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** I'm offering a price that's lower than my initial offer but still higher than Bob's, showing willingness to negotiate. 
* **Moving towards a middle ground:** $16,000 represents a compromise between my minimum and Bob's offer.
* **Keeping John as a backup:** I'm still open to selling to John if Bob rejects this offer, but I'm determined to see if we can reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  Bob's offer of $14,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.  Accepting it would mean losing money.
* **Close to John's offer:**  Since John is willing to pay $15,000, I'm getting close to a point where selling to John might be the better option if Bob doesn't budge.
* **Opportunity to counter:**  I'm still willing to see if I can negotiate a higher price with Bob, but I'm getting closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $14,500 is simply too low for me. To be fair, I'm willing to go down to $15,500. This is a final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options. "", ""product_price"": 15500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** This counteroffer signals that I'm nearing my limit and am serious about getting closer to my minimum. 
* **Small concession:**  While I'm not willing to go below $15,000, I'm offering a small concession to demonstrate my willingness to find a compromise.
* **Pressure point:**  Mentioning other options (selling to John) subtly puts pressure on Bob to consider my offer seriously.
* **Time is ticking:** We are halfway through the negotiations, and I need to start seriously considering selling to John if Bob doesn't come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're trying to get a good price, but $15,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and if we can't agree, I'll have to explore other options, including buying from John for $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** $14,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John is a guaranteed sale:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, and I'm running out of time. 
* **Bob's tactic:**  Bob's mention of buying from John for $10,000 is a bluff, as he's already stated the product is worth $10,000 to him. This is likely a tactic to pressure me into accepting a lower price.
* **No more room for negotiation:** With only four rounds left, continuing to negotiate with Bob could lead to further losses and a potential stalemate.

It's time to cut my losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John."
