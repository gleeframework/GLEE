"Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price would still leave you with a good profit, and it's closer to the value I place on it. What do you think?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,
