"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation.  Since my goal is to save as much money as possible, I'll reject the offer and see if I can get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price would still leave you with a good profit, and it's closer to the value I place on it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to get a better deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good compromise.  It's still a significant saving compared to buying from John for $1,200,000.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a much higher price.  Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the best strategy in this situation."
