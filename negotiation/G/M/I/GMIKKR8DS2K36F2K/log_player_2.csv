"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

```

**Explanation:**

You want to save as much money as possible. Since John is willing to sell the product for $1,000,000, you can reject Alice's offer and buy it from John at the same price. This doesn't save you any money, but it prevents you from losing money."
