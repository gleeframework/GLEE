"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $13,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $13,000 is a better price than John's offer, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I'm interested,  $13,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to spend. I'm willing to pay $10,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant price reduction. He's offering $10,000, which is still above Alice's minimum ($8,000) but considerably less than her initial offer. This counteroffer shows Bob is serious about buying but is also trying to secure a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $10,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is a better price than John's offer, Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to continue exploring if a better deal is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $11,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to pay $11,000. This is a fair price that would allow us both to walk away feeling good about the deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by meeting Alice halfway in his counteroffer. He's only $500 off Alice's latest price, demonstrating that he's serious about buying but still wants a better deal. This could encourage Alice to accept, especially as it's still above her minimum."
