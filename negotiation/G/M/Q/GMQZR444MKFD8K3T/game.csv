"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm confident it will be even more valuable to you. I'm starting with an asking price of $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial deal.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value of this product,  $1,400,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still a bit far from where I need to be. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the true value of this product and leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's keep talking.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,200,000.  I'm willing to offer $1,250,000 as a compromise.  I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
