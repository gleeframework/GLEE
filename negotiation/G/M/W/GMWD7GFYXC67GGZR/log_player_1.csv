"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has value, $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

The product is worth $1,000,000 to me, and Bob's offer is below that. I'm going to counteroffer and try to get a better price."
