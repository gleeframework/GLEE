"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750,000 is just too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so how about $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal.",875000.0,Alice,5,
