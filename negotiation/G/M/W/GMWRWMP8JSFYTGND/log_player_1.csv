Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it carefully."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $1,000,000, which is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some wiggle room to potentially meet somewhere in the middle.
* **Creating urgency:** I'm using a ""one-time offer"" tactic to create pressure on Bob to accept quickly.
* **Balancing profit and potential deal:**  While this price is below my absolute minimum, it's a reasonable starting point that could lead to a successful sale. It's also important to remember that I can always walk away and sell to John for my minimum price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000. While $750,000 is still a decent amount of money, it's not worth risking losing the potential of selling to John for my desired price.  I will counteroffer and attempt to negotiate a price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $750,000 is just too far below what I need to make this deal work.  I'm willing to go to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I think it's a good opportunity for you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer with justification:** I'm rejecting Bob's offer but also providing a reason for doing so, making the counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Meeting in the middle:** $900,000 is a halfway point between my previous offer and Bob's offer, signaling a willingness to compromise.
* **Highlighting the benefit:**  I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" and a ""good opportunity"" for Bob, further motivating him to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my leverage and show that I'm not desperate to make a deal at any price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $900,000, so how about $825,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $825,000 is closer to my minimum desired price, it's still below my target.  I need to keep pushing for a higher price.  I'm not desperate to sell to Bob and can always fall back on John's offer.  I will counteroffer with a price closer to my preferred range, aiming to close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $825,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise, and I think it reflects the value of the product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to compromise by lowering my price, but still maintaining a significant margin above Bob's offer.
* **Fairness:** I emphasize that this is a ""fair compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency:** I suggest ""closing the deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Value reminder:** I reiterate the ""value of the product"" to remind Bob of the potential benefits.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping my price above my minimum. I'm still in a position to walk away and sell to John if necessary, but I'm also demonstrating my willingness to negotiate towards a mutually beneficial outcome."
