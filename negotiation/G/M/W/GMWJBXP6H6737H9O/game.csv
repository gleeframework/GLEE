"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this unique product that I think you'll love. I'm looking for $25000 for it. Is that something you'd be interested in?",25000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but $25000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $20000?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you at $22000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",22000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I really like the product, but $22000 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offer, so I'll make a counteroffer of $19500. I think this is a fair price for both of us.",19500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $21000, but I have to say that I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure it's worth it for me. Can we discuss this further?",21000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $20000. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $20250, but I'm willing to meet you at $20500 if you're willing to meet me halfway from $20250. What do you think?",20250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $20250. I'm willing to meet you at $21500, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. Can we finalize the deal at this price?",21500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go above $20750. I'm willing to meet you at this price, but I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",20750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $21000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is the absolute lowest price I can accept for the product. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",21000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best price for the product, but I'm not willing to go any higher than $20750. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",20750.0,Bob,10,
