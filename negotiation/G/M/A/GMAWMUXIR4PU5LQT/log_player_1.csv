{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is slightly higher than Bob's perceived value of $100, leaving room for negotiation. It also gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $175 is a bit steep for me.  How about $125?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $125 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $140?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product. "", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $130?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can close the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $130 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price point.  Considering John is willing to pay $150, I'll take that option and sell to him."
