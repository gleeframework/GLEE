Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,400,000. This is my best and final offer for now. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway from $1,600,000, so how about $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $1,500,000 is a significant profit. It's always possible to lose a deal by being too aggressive, and this price point represents a strong return."
