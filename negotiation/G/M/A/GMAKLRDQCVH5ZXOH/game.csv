"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's worth at least $1,500,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This represents a significant savings for you and allows me to earn a fair profit.  Let me know if you're interested. If you decline, I have another buyer lined up who will purchase it for $800,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
