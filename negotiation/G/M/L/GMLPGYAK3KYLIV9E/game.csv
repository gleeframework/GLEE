"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a compromise. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective on the value, the product's worth to me is considerably higher. I could consider letting it go for $1,050,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, reflecting my hope to find a mutually agreeable solution.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit far from reaching my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $950,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and understand you see value in this product.  I've already made a significant price reduction, and to be completely transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point.  My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
