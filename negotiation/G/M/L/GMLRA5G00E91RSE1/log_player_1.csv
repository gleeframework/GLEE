Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of the strategy and the offer:

**Strategy:**

The key here is understanding that you have a guaranteed sale with John at $1,500,000. This is your ""safety net"".  Therefore, any amount you can get above $1,500,000 from Bob is a bonus. However, we need to balance this with the risk of Bob rejecting the offer. 

**Offer:**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product could be incredibly valuable to you, potentially saving you significant costs in the long run. I'm offering it to you at a price of $1,450,000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation:**

* **High but Reasonable Price:**  We're aiming slightly below Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) while staying significantly above your guaranteed sale price.
* **Highlighting Value:** The message focuses on the product's benefits and potential cost savings,  justifying the high price. 
* **Confidence:**  By expressing confidence in the fairness of the price, we aim to influence Bob's perception. 

**Important Notes:**

* This offer assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or financial constraints. 
* You can adjust the price slightly higher or lower depending on your risk tolerance. However, going too close to $1,500,000 leaves little room for negotiation."
