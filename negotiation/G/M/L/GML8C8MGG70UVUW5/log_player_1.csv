Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make a smart financial decision. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000.
