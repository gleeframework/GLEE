"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I'm open to discussing the price, but I believe this is a fair starting point.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe this product has a lot of potential, but I need to make a smart financial decision. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not willing to go above $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your perspective on the price, I believe $700,000 significantly undervalues the product's true potential.  To find a middle ground, how about we settle at $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $850,000. I think this is a fair compromise, considering the product's value and my budget.",850000.0,Bob,4,
