"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. Given its exceptional value and quality, we believe it's worth every penny of its true worth, which is $15,000 to you. However, to facilitate a smooth transaction and considering the current market conditions, I am offering it to you at a special introductory price of $14,000. This is an exclusive opportunity tailored specifically for you, and I hope you find this offer compelling. Should you have any questions or require further information, please don't hesitate to reach out. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. While she has lowered the price, you know you can get the product for $15,000 from John. Rejecting her offer opens the possibility of a counter-offer from Alice at a lower price."
