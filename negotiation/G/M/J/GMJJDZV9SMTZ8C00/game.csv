"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible for us to negotiate the price down to $75? I believe this would be a fair compromise.",75.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This still gives you a great price for a valuable product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",85.0,Alice,3,
