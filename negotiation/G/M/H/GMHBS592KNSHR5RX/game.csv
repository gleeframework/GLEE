"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great opportunity to get a fantastic product at a competitive price. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its potential, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is a fair price considering its value to you.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $880,000. This is still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our original offers. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price.  $880,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit off. I'm willing to offer $860,000. This is a fair compromise that recognizes your need to profit while remaining within my budget.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",860000.0,Bob,4,
