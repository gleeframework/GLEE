{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts with a price that is significantly lower than my minimum but still above Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal while also giving me some leeway to counteroffer if needed.  I'm also highlighting the value to Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm really looking to stay within my budget of $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $10,500?  I think it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to try and negotiate a better price with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is still a bit below what I need.  How about we split the difference and go with $11,250?  I'm willing to be flexible, but I can't go any lower than that."", ""product_price"": 11250}
