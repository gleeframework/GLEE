(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. It's always beneficial to try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,250,000 is still above Bob's desired price point. There's still room for negotiation, and it's worth trying to get a lower price before potentially buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and your original asking price."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is now at Bob's maximum price point.  It's a good deal considering the product's value to Bob, and it's also the same price as John's offer. Accepting this offer eliminates the risk of further negotiation and ensures Bob gets the product at the best possible price."
