"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,250,000 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to me and your original asking price.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you and my own minimum requirement. Let's finalize this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
