"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $8,500 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250?  I think that's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $9,250. How about we try $8,750? I think that's a more reasonable compromise for me.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,750 still doesn't quite work for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident we can finalize this sale.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to walking away, but I'm still willing to negotiate. How about we try $8,900? I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're pushing for a lower price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. $8,900 is still a little too low for me. How about we try $8,950?  This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us. ",8950.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go up to $8,950. I think I've been reasonable so far, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. How about we try $8,800? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not going to go any higher.",8800.0,Bob,8,
