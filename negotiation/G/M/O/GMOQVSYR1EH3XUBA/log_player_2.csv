Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to your value of $120, it's still not ideal. It's worth one more round of negotiation to see if you can get it closer to your target price."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $125
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $125 is only $5 less than what John is selling it for.  While further negotiation is possible, the risk is that Alice might not come down further, and you'd end up paying more than you need to. Buying from John at $120 is the safest and most cost-effective choice in this situation."
