"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'd be happy to pay $10,000 for the product. What do you think?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to come down to $11,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,000 is still a bit higher than what I can comfortably pay.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would be a fair price for both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,
