Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $16,000.  Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 16000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might be getting a deal if he can get you to come down. 
* **Knowing Your Worth:** You know John will buy the product for $12,000, so that's your absolute floor.  Anything above that is profit.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential to negotiate."
