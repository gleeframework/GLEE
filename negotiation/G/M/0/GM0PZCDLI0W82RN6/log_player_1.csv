Bob's offer:

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $13,500? I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500

``` 
While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, it's clear it's unlikely to reach close to $15,000.  The guaranteed $15,000 from John makes that a more appealing option at this point.
