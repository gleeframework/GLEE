"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. While it's a step in the right direction, it's still considerably below my minimum price point. Let's compromise - I'm willing to drop the price to $1,300,000. This offer reflects the value of the product to you and still allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
