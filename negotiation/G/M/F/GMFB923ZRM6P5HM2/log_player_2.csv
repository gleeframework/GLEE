It's better to try and negotiate with Alice. You have a lot of room to save money before resorting to John's offer."

Alice's offer is getting closer to what we want, but we can still get a better price.  Let's continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

We're getting close to Alice's price now, but we're still within our budget and have a few rounds left to see if we can get a slight discount.  We'll offer a bit more, but hopefully, she'll come down a little to close the deal."

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000.

At this point, we're very close to our desired price and getting closer to John's price.  It's a good deal, and it's worth accepting to avoid the risk of Alice backing out or us having to pay John's higher price."
