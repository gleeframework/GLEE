"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I'm confident you'll love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is much higher than both your budget and John's offer. It's highly unlikely you'll find a deal you're happy with if you accept this. It's time to negotiate!"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is intentionally low to leave room for negotiation.  It demonstrates a strong desire to save money.
* **Polite and Open:** The message remains respectful and expresses continued interest in the product, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation.
* **Targeting Value:**  Aiming for $6,000 puts me significantly below my $8,000 maximum and well below Alice's asking price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to make a drastic cut to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly, $9,000 is still above your $8,000 fallback option with John.  There's room for negotiation, and you haven't reached your maximum budget yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  $9,000 is closer, but it's still a bit above my budget. How about $7,500? That's a fair offer, and I'm ready to close the deal if you're agreeable."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($9,000) and your previous offer ($6,000). It shows willingness to compromise while still pushing for a significant discount.
* **Sense of Urgency:** The message conveys a desire to finalize the deal, potentially motivating Alice to accept if she's eager to sell.
* **Staying Below John's Offer:**  While closer to your limit, $7,500 keeps you below your guaranteed option with John, maintaining some negotiating leverage."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $7,500 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to make one more compromise and offer the product for $8,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is now only $500 away from John's offer, and she's stated this is her ""lowest.""  It's unlikely she'll move much further. While you *might* be able to squeeze out a slightly better deal, it's not worth the risk of her sticking to $8,500 or ending negotiations. You've successfully negotiated a lower price, but John's offer is now the better deal."
