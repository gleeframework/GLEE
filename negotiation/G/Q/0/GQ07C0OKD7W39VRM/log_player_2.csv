# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is lower than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's actual worth to Alice ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a more competitive price. She might come back with a better offer to avoid losing the sale."
