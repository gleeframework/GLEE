Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that's a bit lower than the $100 Bob values the product at,  leaving room for potential negotiation. It's also a good starting point because it's more than the $80 you need to make to break even."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $75. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $80. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85, which is still a great deal for you considering how much you value the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 85} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $85 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $80? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, and I don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate.  It's better to accept his offer and get the sale than to keep negotiating and potentially end up with nothing."
