"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it. I'm offering it to you for $90. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. I can try negotiating for a lower price or buy from John for $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $90 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
``` 

I am aiming low to see how much Alice is willing to negotiate.  Even if she rejects this offer, it gives me more information for future counteroffers.  I still have the option of going to John if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $70 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming closer to my price range, but I can still try to negotiate further down.  It's worth another counteroffer before accepting $85 or going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand, $70 was a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $77?"",
""product_price"": 77
}
``` 

I'm trying to nudge the price closer to my target while still leaving some room for negotiation.  This keeps me in the game with Alice while moving towards a favorable outcome."
