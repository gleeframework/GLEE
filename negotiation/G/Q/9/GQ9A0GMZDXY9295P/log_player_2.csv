"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

You should reject the offer. You are looking to save as much money as possible, and $110 is still above your target of $100.  You have 10 rounds to negotiate with Alice, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm looking to spend no more than $100 for this product.  Would you be willing to consider $95?"", ""product_price"": 95}

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
You should reject Alice's offer.  You are still trying to stay below $100. While Alice has moved closer to your target price, you still have 7 rounds left to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit higher than my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $102. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $100 and $105. How about we try $102.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $102.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

You should choose to buy the product from John. While Alice has come down to $102.50, which is only $2.50 above your target, you only have 5 rounds left in the negotiation. There's no guarantee that Alice will lower her price further, and there's a risk you might not be able to secure the product at your desired price. It's better to be safe and buy from John for $100."
