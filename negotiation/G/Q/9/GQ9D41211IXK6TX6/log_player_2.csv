Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. Given your commitment to buying, I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go below $80. It's better to cut your losses and buy from John for your target price."
