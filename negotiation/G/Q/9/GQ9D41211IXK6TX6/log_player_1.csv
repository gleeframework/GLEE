"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than the product's value to me ($100) and slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80). This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm being friendly and suggesting that Bob will value the product. This can encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message implies I'm open to discussion and hopefully avoids a quick ""no"" from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $110 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $65 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Room for negotiation:**  While Bob's offer is low, it demonstrates his interest. I can use this as a starting point for my counteroffer.
* **Seeking a better deal:**  I'm not yet ready to settle for such a low price. I want to explore if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $65 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to negotiate. How about $90? That's still a great deal for you, and it's a fair price for me."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** My counteroffer of $90 is a compromise,  meeting Bob halfway between his offer ($65) and my initial offer ($110). This shows I'm flexible and willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing value:** I'm reminding Bob that even at $90, he's getting a good deal. This can motivate him to accept.
* **Maintaining my bottom line:** $90 is still above my minimum price of $100, but it demonstrates a willingness to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $75 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $100 threshold. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **Negotiation is ongoing:** Bob's willingness to compromise shows his continued interest. This gives me leverage to continue negotiating for a better price.
* **Exploring further possibilities:** With five rounds left, I still have time to see if I can secure a higher price. Selling to John for $100 is always an option, but I'd rather try to get closer to my ideal price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle.  However, $75 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $85?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between his offer ($75) and my previous offer ($90). This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate further.
* **Highlighting fairness:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the $85 price point for both of us.  This can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need to close the deal by mentioning ""finally"" closing. This can create a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Still above my minimum:** $85 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's a significant step closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. $85 is still a bit higher than I was hoping for. I can do $78, and I promise that's my final offer. What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer of $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my $100 threshold. I'm not willing to sell for less than my minimum.
* **John's offer is a safety net:** Even though Bob is claiming it's his final offer, I can always fall back on John's $100 offer.
* **Time is running out:** With only four rounds left, I need to be cautious and prioritize getting as close to my minimum price as possible.  
* **Potential for a better deal:** With some negotiation, there's still a chance that I can get Bob to come closer to my minimum price or even accept a price closer to $85."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your final offer, but $78 is still a bit too low for me. Given your commitment to buying, I'm willing to go down to $82. This is a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 82}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise, splitting the difference between his offer ($78) and my previous offer ($85). This shows I'm willing to negotiate further.
* **Emphasizing fairness:** I'm again emphasizing the fairness of the $82 price point for both of us. This can make it more appealing to Bob.
* **Urgency:** I'm subtly emphasizing the need to close the deal by mentioning ""finally"" closing. This can create a sense of urgency for Bob. 
* **Staying above my minimum:** $82 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $100, but it's a significant step closer to my desired price.
* **Time pressure:** With only three rounds left, I need to push for a deal, but also avoid making concessions that put me too far below my minimum."
