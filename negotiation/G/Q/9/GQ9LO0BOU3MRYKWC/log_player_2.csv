Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to go below $130, Bob. But I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $128. It's the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price for the product.

It seems unlikely Alice will go much lower than $128. Continuing the negotiation has a low chance of saving much more, and risks the price going up. It's a better decision to cut losses and buy from John for $150."
