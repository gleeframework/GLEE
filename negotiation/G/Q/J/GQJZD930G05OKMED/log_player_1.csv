Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your confidence in the product. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This reflects the value I see in the product, while giving you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a good return, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $875,000. This shows my commitment to acquiring the product, while still keeping the price within a reasonable range.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial agreement.
