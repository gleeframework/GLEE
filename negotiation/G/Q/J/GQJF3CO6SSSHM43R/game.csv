"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for 13500. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth to me is 12000.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, thanks for being flexible. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $13500 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm happy to meet you at $13000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go below 14000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for 14000. This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the product's worth to me is 12000.",14000.0,Alice,5,
