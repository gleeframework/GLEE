Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and features, I'm initially offering it at $22,000."", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way beyond my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $9,000 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest! I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? I'm confident you won't regret this investment."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I could potentially stretch my budget to $11,000. Would that work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a fair deal, I can't go as low as $11,000. To be candid, I have another potential buyer.  However, I value our conversation, so I'm willing to make one more significant move.  My final offer is $15,000. This is a considerable discount and reflects my desire to close the deal with you."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being upfront. I understand you have other potential buyers and I appreciate the discount, but $15,000 is still pushing it for me.  How about we settle at $12,500? This is a fair offer, considering your other potential buyer might not be willing to match it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unlikely to move much higher than his $12,500 offer. Holding out for a slightly better deal with him isn't worth the risk of losing the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
