"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $750,000 for it. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  While I want to work with Bob, I'm not willing to lose so much money.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your offer, but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work.  How about $850,000?  This is still a great deal for you, considering the product's value, and allows me to move forward with the sale. Let's try to find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $825,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still below my initial asking price, it's a fair compromise that gets me very close to my minimum acceptable price.  Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely, and I'm confident that $825,000 is a good outcome."
