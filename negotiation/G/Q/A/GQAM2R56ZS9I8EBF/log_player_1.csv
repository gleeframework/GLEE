{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum value of $1,500,000 but acknowledging Bob's perceived value of $1,000,000. By offering a price within this range, I'm showing a willingness to negotiate while still holding out for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,100,000 for your product. I believe this price reflects its true value while allowing us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $1,100,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still significantly less than my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob to try and secure a more favorable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,175,000? I'm confident this price is fair considering the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1175000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. However, I would like to stick closer to my initial proposal. Considering the negotiations so far, I would like to suggest a counteroffer of $1,125,000 for your product. This price still allows me to save money while acknowledging the value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,125,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's counteroffer of $1,125,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a price that is worthwhile for me.  Therefore, it is best to sell the product to John for $1,500,000."
