Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum price of $10,000. I want to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price and I think I can get a better deal from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm countering with $12,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still above my minimum price. I want to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer. While it's only my minimum, it's better than selling to John for the same price. There's no guarantee that continuing the negotiation will get me a higher price, and I'm willing to secure the sale at this point."
