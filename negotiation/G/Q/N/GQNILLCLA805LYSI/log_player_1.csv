Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $140. What do you think?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product but $140 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $130. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: While $130 is a decent offer, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob as the product's value for him ($150) is significantly higher than his offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"",
