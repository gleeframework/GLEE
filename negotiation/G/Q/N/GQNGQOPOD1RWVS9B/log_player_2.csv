# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase my product for $14,000. I believe it holds significant value that could benefit you greatly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

While $14,000 is a good price, it's still above your ideal range. It's worth exploring if you can get it lower.  You have room to negotiate and potentially save more money."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $12,500 is a fair offer, the value of this product to me is quite high. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,250? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is getting closer to your ideal price, but there's still room to negotiate.  You can likely get a better price than $13,250 without risking too much.  Rejecting the offer allows you to continue the negotiation and potentially save more money."
