"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $14,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go right now.  Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $12,500 is a fair offer, the value of this product to me is quite high. Would you consider meeting in the middle at $13,250?",13250.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. $13,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference at $13,000.  This would give you a fair price and save me some money.  What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,
