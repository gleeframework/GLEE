"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $6,000 to you. Considering your interest in the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the benefits it will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $7,000, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering our previous discussions, I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go lower than $8,500. Since you have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal."
