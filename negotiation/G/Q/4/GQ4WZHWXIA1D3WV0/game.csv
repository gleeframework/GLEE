"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $800,000, and I'm confident you'll find it's a great investment.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the value of the product to me. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. This would still be a good deal for you, and it's within my budget. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $825,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than what I'm prepared to spend right now.  I'm ready to pay $800,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me and would make this a quick and easy transaction for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,
