# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. It's a unique and valuable item that I think you'll really appreciate.

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his limit. Bob should try to negotiate further to see if he can get closer to the $800,000 price point."
