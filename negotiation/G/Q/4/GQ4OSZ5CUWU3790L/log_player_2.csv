"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something you value at $15,000, and I'm willing to let it go for a bit less. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well above my minimum price. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly aware you value the product at $15,000 and is trying to get close to that price. By rejecting her offer, you signal that you're willing to walk away unless the deal is better. You can try negotiating a lower price with Alice, or you can go with John's offer of $15,000 as a backup."
