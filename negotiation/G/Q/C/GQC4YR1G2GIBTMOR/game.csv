"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  I'm confident we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of our discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This price aims to bridge the gap between our previous offers while still ensuring a fair return for us. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and look forward to your consideration.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $875,000. This price is fair and allows for both of us to gain something from this transaction. I believe it's a good starting point for a mutually beneficial agreement.",875000.0,Bob,4,
