"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which we believe holds immense value for you. Given its significance to both of us, I propose an initial offer of $950,000 for the product. This price reflects a fair balance between the intrinsic value of the product and our willingness to accommodate your expectations. I look forward to your response and the opportunity to discuss this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're aiming to save as much money as possible, and $950,000 is significantly above your ideal price.
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.** By rejecting, you open the opportunity to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a better price.
* **Buying from John is the worst option.**  It's the most expensive option, and there's no guarantee of a better deal elsewhere."

{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'd like to propose a price of $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and allows for both of us to benefit from the transaction.  I'm confident we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of our discussion, I would like to counter with an offer of $900,000 for the product. This price aims to bridge the gap between our previous offers while still ensuring a fair return for us. I hope this proposal aligns better with your expectations and look forward to your consideration.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.** While it's lower than her initial offer, $900,000 is still above your ideal price range.
* **There's room for further negotiation.**  You can likely secure a better price by rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer.
* **Buying from John is still the worst option.**  As before, it's the most expensive choice, and you're trying to save money."
