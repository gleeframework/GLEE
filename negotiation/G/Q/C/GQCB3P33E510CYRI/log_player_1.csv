Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,750,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and I'm confident it will be a great investment. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for negotiation while still giving me a comfortable margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that starting price is quite high. I understand the value, but I'm working within a tighter budget. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'm open to negotiation, I won't sell the product for less than $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation going."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to drop my price to $1,200,000.  This still allows me a fair profit while giving you a good deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer. Let's aim for a price that works for both of us. How about $1,050,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not in a rush and I want to see if we can get closer to my target. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,150,000.  This price is still a good deal for you, and it allows me to meet you halfway.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I have a guaranteed buyer in John who's willing to pay significantly more. I'll counteroffer again to see if we can bridge the gap, but I'm not willing to go below $1,500,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're pushing hard, but I can't go lower than $1,400,000.  This offer still gives you a significant return on investment, and it's a price I can reasonably accept.  Let's end this negotiation on a positive note."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
