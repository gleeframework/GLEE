# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000.  I believe this is a fair price considering what it would cost elsewhere and the benefits it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
