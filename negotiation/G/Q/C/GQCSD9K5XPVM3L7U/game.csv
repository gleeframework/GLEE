"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, which is $10,000. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you be open to $13,000?  That would be a fair deal.",13000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make a compromise at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,5,
