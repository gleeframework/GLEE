# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?

""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. However, $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I have a budget in mind. Would you consider a price closer to $12,000?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you have a budget in mind, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $14,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, which is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit in the middle.  However, $14,000 is still pushing my budget. Would you be open to $13,000?  That would be a fair deal."",

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I can see you're willing to pay a premium for this product, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to make a compromise at $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident you'll find this a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has signaled that $15,000 is her absolute lowest price.  It's unlikely she'll go lower. Since you can buy the product from John for $10,000, continuing the negotiation with Alice has no benefit. You maximize your savings by going with John."
