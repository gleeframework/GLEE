"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you! After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this price is fair and reasonable, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with your decision to invest in this product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000, you know you have another option with John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed to purchase from John at your maximum budget."
