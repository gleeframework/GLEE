I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a price that is significantly higher than my minimum of $12,000, but still leaves some room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be willing to pay this price, as it is still lower than the value he places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get closer to my desired price. I will counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $13,500. This is a compromise between my previous offer and his counteroffer, and I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum. However, the risk of continuing the negotiation and potentially ending with a lower price than John's offer isn't worth it. I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $12,000 to ensure a guaranteed sale at a decent price."
