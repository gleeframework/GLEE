"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I think the product is worth less than you're asking. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I can't go that far.  Let's meet in the middle at $975,000. This price still allows for a profit for me and is closer to your initial offer. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I still think the product is worth less than $975,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
