Round 6
Bob's offer:

``` 

At this point, Bob is consistently moving towards a price closer to your goal. Accepting his offer of $1,262,500 is a good deal considering:

* **Significant Profit:** You're still making a $262,500 profit over your minimum.
* **Time Value:**  Dragging the negotiation further might not yield much more, and you risk Bob lowering his offer or walking away.
* **John as Backup:** While John offers a safe $1,000,000, accepting Bob's offer maximizes your profit."
