"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we bring it down to $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,1050000.0
"I understand that $850,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,050,000. This is my best and final offer for now.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something lower. Could we do $925,000?  I think that would be a fair compromise.",925000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,1000000.0
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. However, $925,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $1,000,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go.",1000000.0,Alice,5,,
