"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think!",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value you get. Let's meet in the middle.",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. I'm definitely interested, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise.",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $8,250? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us.",8250.0,Alice,5,
