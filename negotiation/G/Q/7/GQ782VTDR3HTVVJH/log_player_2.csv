"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth significantly more to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is quite high. It makes sense to negotiate for a lower price, aiming for something closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,500 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $7,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  By starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price, we establish a base for negotiation. 
* **Aiming for the Middle:** Our goal is to meet somewhere in the middle between her value ($8,000) and our maximum ($10,000). A counteroffer of $7,000 gives us room to negotiate upwards while still aiming for a good deal. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:**  This counteroffer will help us understand how flexible Alice is willing to be on price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $7,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great price considering the value you get. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, which is a good sign. However, there's still room for negotiation. We are aiming for a price closer to $8,000, and accepting $8,500 would leave a significant chunk of our budget unused. It's worth countering again to see if we can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget. I'm definitely interested, but $8,500 is still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. Would you consider $7,750? That feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 7750
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We are moving up in price, but in a controlled way.  A $750 increase shows willingness to negotiate without conceding too much ground too quickly.
* **Finding the Midpoint:**  Our counteroffer of $7,750 is a near-perfect midpoint between Alice's last offer ($8,500) and our previous counteroffer ($7,000). 
* **Maintaining Pressure:**  By continuing to negotiate, we maintain pressure on Alice to move closer to our desired price range."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  How about $8,250? That's a significant discount from my initial offer and a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Close Enough:**  $8,250 is only $250 over our ideal price and well below John's offer. 
* **Time Constraint:**  We are now halfway through the negotiation rounds. While we might be able to push Alice a bit further, there's a risk she won't budge much more. 
* **Solid Deal:** Accepting at $8,250 secures a good price for a product we know we value."
