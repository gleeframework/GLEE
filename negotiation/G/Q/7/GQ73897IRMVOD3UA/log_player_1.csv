Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $800,000 to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still allows me to make a profit while keeping Bob potentially interested. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  A price of $900,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000 than the $800,000 Bob is willing to pay.
* **Maintain Potential:** This price is still attractive enough for Bob to potentially accept the offer, as he still gets a $100,000 benefit.
* **Backup Option:**  If Bob rejects, I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,000,000."
