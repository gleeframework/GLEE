,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of your product, $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $9,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I can comfortably spend. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're open to that.",10500.0,Bob,4,
