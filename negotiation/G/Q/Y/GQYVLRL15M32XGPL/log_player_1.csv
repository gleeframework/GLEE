{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer starts with a relatively high price, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also frames the offer as beneficial to Bob, making it more likely he'll accept.  If he rejects, I'll be prepared to counter-offer and ultimately decide if I want to sell to him or John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price slightly lower than my original offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $13,250?  This still leaves you a good deal compared to its value to you, and it's closer to my desired price."", ""product_price"": 13250} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $13,250 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $12,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. While I'd ideally like to get closer to my initial asking price, it's not worth the risk of losing him and ending up with the lower price from John.  I'll accept his offer to ensure a successful sale."
