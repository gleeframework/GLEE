"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This is a significant premium over my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn more. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is my minimum value, I'm not eager to settle just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze out a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

I'm going to lower my price a bit to $1,350,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but it's still a significant margin above my minimum. I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm hoping to get. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum price with this counteroffer. I'm offering $1,250,000, which is still $50,000 above my floor. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting progressively lower, and I'm running out of time. I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from him, and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a price below my minimum.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for my minimum price of $1,200,000."
