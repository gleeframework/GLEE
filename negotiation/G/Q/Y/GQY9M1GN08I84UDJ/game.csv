"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you considering this sale. I'm really interested in the product but my budget is a bit tighter.  Would you be willing to come down to $12,000?  I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your budget constraints, $12,000 is significantly below its value.  Could you do $18,000? That's a significant reduction on my initial offer.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $18,000 is still a bit higher than I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference and settle on $16,500? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product for both of us.",16500.0,Bob,4,
