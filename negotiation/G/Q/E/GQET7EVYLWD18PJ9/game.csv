"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product, and I think it would be a perfect fit for you. I'm asking for $18000 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $14000 for the product, considering my budget and the value I see in it.  Let me know if you're open to that.",14000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $16000.  This product is truly special, and I believe it's worth the investment.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $16000 is still a bit more than I can justify. I'm willing to go up to $15000, which is my absolute maximum. If you're not willing to accept that, I'll have to move on to other options. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",15000.0,Bob,4,
