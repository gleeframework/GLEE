"Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $100
* **Your Value:** $120
* **Alice's Value:** $80
* **John's Price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer allows you to buy the product for $100, which is less than your maximum willingness to pay ($120) and results in a net gain for you. Rejecting Alice's offer would force you to buy from John at a higher price, resulting in a lower net gain."
