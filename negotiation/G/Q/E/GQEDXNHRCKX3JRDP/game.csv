"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to me. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. It's a fair price considering its value.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $900,000?  That's a significant saving for me and still a good deal for you.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 still falls short of what I need. I'm willing to compromise further and offer the product for $925,000.  This is a fair price that considers both of our interests. Let's finalize this deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
