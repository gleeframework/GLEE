Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value proposition, I believe a price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Value:** I know the product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, giving me a strong negotiating advantage.
* **Maximizing Profit:** I aim for a price significantly higher than my minimum ($800,000) but still attractive to Bob. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While $950,000 is my initial offer, the message implies openness to discussion, should Bob counter. 
* **Backup Plan:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
