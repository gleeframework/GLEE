"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you.  I'm asking for $10,000 to start. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $6,000. Can you meet me there?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $6,000 is significantly below its value. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit far from $8,500. How about we aim for $7,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like to go.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
