Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","Since Alice's offer is exactly $120, which is the maximum I'm willing to pay, I can save $0 by accepting her offer. I'll choose to accept her offer to buy the product.
