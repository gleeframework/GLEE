"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,300,000 is fair. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By beginning with a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to anchor the negotiation in my favor. Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, his counteroffers might be influenced by this higher starting point.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This high initial price provides ample room for negotiation and potential concessions, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal as we progress.
* **Testing the Waters:** This first round is as much about gauging Bob's interest and negotiation style as it is about the price itself. His response will give me valuable information to tailor my strategy in subsequent rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  I believe this is a fair price, given the potential value and my own resources.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is a decent chunk above his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate, but not to the point of losing hundreds of thousands of dollars.  I'll counteroffer in the next round to try and bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. This product has the potential to generate significant returns, and I need to ensure a fair deal for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession (but above minimum):**  I've lowered my price by $200,000, which is a substantial concession designed to signal flexibility and encourage Bob to negotiate seriously. However, this price still keeps me well above my $1,000,000 minimum. 
* **Justification:**  I'm reiterating the product's value proposition to remind Bob of the potential benefits, justifying the higher price.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":**  By suggesting a price directly in the middle of our previous offers, I'm framing it as a fair compromise and encouraging Bob to reciprocate with a counteroffer closer to my desired range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair reflection of the product's potential. I believe we can find a mutually beneficial agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Reaching the Limit:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but at $950,000, it's still a $50,000 difference.  The increments by which he's increasing his offer suggest that getting him to $1,000,000 is unlikely.
* **Guaranteed Profit:** John's standing offer of $1,000,000 guarantees that I meet my absolute minimum.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a chance of a slightly higher payout, but it also carries the risk of the deal falling through.
* **Time Value & Opportunity Cost:**  Each round spent negotiating with Bob is time I could be using to finalize the deal with John or potentially find other buyers. 

It's time to cut my losses and take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
