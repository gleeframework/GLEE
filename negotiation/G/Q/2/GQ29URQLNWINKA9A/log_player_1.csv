{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,190,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire it before it's made available elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without going below our own $1,200,000 minimum.
* **John as a Guarantee:** Knowing John will buy the product for $1,200,000 provides a safety net. We don't *have* to go below that price.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $1,190,000 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially counter-offer if he's highly motivated. 

**Important:** This is just one possible strategy.  We could start higher and negotiate down, but this initial offer aims for a strong, yet potentially acceptable, starting point."
