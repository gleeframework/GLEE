"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to make Bob feel good about the potential deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not starting at my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, as that might scare Bob away immediately. 
* **Time Limit:**  Knowing I have 10 rounds and a backup buyer, I can afford to start a little high and see how Bob responds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $9,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation is Possible:**  While Bob's offer is too low, he's shown interest and is willing to negotiate.  I have 9 rounds left and a backup buyer, so I can afford to continue negotiating.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  In the next round, I'll counter with a price closer to my desired range, but still leaving room for compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is just too far below my minimum. I'm willing to come down a bit further. How about $11,000? That still gives you a good price, and it's closer to what I need to make this worth my while."", ""product_price"": 11000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing I'm willing to compromise by coming down from my initial offer of $12,000.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm highlighting the value Bob will get at $11,000, while still staying above his initial offer.
* **Setting a Clear Boundary:**  I'm making it clear that $11,000 is my current bottom line, but I'm open to further discussion. 
* **Time Factor:**  With 8 rounds remaining, I still have room to move if necessary, but I need to start getting closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I need to be more careful with my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has shown persistence and moved slightly, $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time to Push Back:** I'm nearing the halfway point of the negotiations.  It's time to signal that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  In the next round, I'll offer a price closer to my target, but still leaving room for a potential compromise if necessary. 

I'm confident that I can achieve a better price than $9,500, and I want to see if Bob is truly willing to close the deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest, but $9,500 is still significantly below what I need to make this deal work. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,500. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Clear Compromise:** I'm offering to meet Bob halfway between our last two offers, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Finality:** I'm starting to signal that this might be my final offer before I move on to my backup buyer.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing this as a win-win scenario where both parties benefit from the deal. 
* **Time Pressure:** With 5 rounds remaining, the pressure is starting to mount, which could motivate Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob has moved slightly closer to my desired price, $9,800 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Time is Running Out:**  We are now past the halfway point of the negotiation, and I need to be assertive in getting closer to my target.
* **Selling to John is an Option:**  I'm starting to seriously consider selling to John.  While I'd prefer to get a better price, I don't want to waste too much time with Bob if he's not willing to come up significantly. 
* **Counteroffer Strategy:**  I'll make one more counteroffer to Bob, but I'll be much closer to my desired price and will be prepared to walk away if he doesn't meet me halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close, but I need to be honest. $9,800 just isn't enough for me to make this work.  I'm willing to come down to $10,000 as a final compromise. It's a great deal for you, and it's the best I can do. If we can't agree on this, I'm going to have to explore other options."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strong signal that I am serious about getting close to my target price and that I'm not willing to go much lower.
* **Time Pressure:**  With only 3 rounds left, the time pressure is increasing, making Bob more likely to consider my offer.
* **Setting the Bar High:**  $10,000 is still well above Bob's offer and a considerable compromise on my part. 
* **Threat of Walking Away:**  The message emphasizes that I'm ready to move on to my backup buyer if we don't reach an agreement.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in this product, but I've been given another opportunity to buy it from someone else. I'm willing to meet you at $9,500, but I need to make a decision soon. Please let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Critical:**  We're in Round 8, leaving only two rounds left.  Time is running out to get a better price.
* **Bob's Offer is Still Low:**  $9,500 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Competition:** While Bob is trying to create a sense of urgency, it's likely a tactic to push me to accept a lower price. 
* **Guaranteed Deal with John:**  Selling to John guarantees me $15,000, which is significantly better than what Bob is offering.  I'm not willing to risk losing out on a guaranteed high price.

Therefore, I'm choosing to sell the product to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, the risk of not getting a deal at all with Bob is too great."
