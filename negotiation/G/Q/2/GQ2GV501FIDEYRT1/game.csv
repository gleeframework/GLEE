"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it. This price would be a win-win, allowing you to make a profit and me to acquire a valuable asset. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down in price. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us. Let's meet in the middle at $1,075,000. This price would allow you to make a significant profit while ensuring that I can acquire the product within my budget. I'm eager to finalize this deal and move forward.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
