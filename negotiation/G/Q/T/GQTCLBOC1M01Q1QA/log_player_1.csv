"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product! I think it's worth a lot, so I'm starting with a price of $180.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 180}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $120.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can likely get a bit more from Bob.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer to see if he's willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a good price, it's a bit lower than I'd hoped for.  I'm willing to come down to $150. Let's see if we can find a happy middle ground."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $150, but I'm still only able to offer $130. It's a good price, and I'm confident we can make a deal at this point. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $130 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to accept it.  While I could potentially keep negotiating, I'm not sure if I'll get a higher offer from Bob, and I risk losing the deal entirely. It's a fair price, and I'd rather lock in the sale than risk waiting and potentially ending up with nothing."
