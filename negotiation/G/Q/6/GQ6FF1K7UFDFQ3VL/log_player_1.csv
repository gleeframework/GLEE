"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1700000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming to get as close to my minimum value as possible while still leaving room for negotiation. I'm confident Bob will counteroffer, and we can work towards a mutually acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,400,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still not where I want to be. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but I'm still holding out for a significant profit. I believe $1,600,000 is a reasonable price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm still aiming for a price closer to my minimum. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get him to budge a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000}
```

I'm coming down to $1,550,000. This is a significant drop from my initial offer, but it's still a price that allows me to meet my minimum requirement.  I believe Bob will recognize that this is a fair offer and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,480,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm getting closer to my minimum, but I'm still not satisfied. There's a possibility that Bob might come up with a better offer, and I'm willing to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1520000}
```

I'm lowering my offer once more to $1,520,000. This is a compromise that allows me to potentially close the deal while still ensuring I meet my minimum goal. The remaining rounds are getting shorter, so I need to find a balance between pushing for a higher price and securing a sale."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,490,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,490,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's getting tight!  I've already gone down a lot from my initial price. Bob's offer is close to my minimum, but I'm not sure I'll be able to get him up to my target in the remaining rounds.  To ensure I meet my minimum, I'm going to sell to John and get my guaranteed $1,500,000."
