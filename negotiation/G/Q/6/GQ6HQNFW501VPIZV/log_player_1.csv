Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

This offer starts with a price higher than Bob's perceived value, but still lower than my minimum acceptable value.  This allows for some room to negotiate down if needed, but also establishes a good starting point."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm willing to negotiate, but I won't go below my minimum of $150.  I'll send a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? It's a fair price for both of us. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still too high for me. How about $135?  It's a good middle ground and lets us both get a fair deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. While I'm willing to negotiate, I don't want to risk going lower and potentially losing out on a better deal. John is offering me my minimum, and I'm going to take that offer."
