{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives you some room to negotiate downwards if he rejects the initial offer.  It also emphasizes the value of the product and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and effort, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Can you meet me at $10,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum threshold of $12,000. I'll counter with a slightly lower price to see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $11,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to go up to $11,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $11,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price. I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer, and selling to him for $12,000 is the most secure option at this point. It's time to move on and secure a deal that meets my needs."
