"I understand that $70 is a good starting point, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $82? It's a fair price for this amazing product, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",82.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're still a bit short on budget, but I'm not willing to go below $85. This product is worth so much more than that, and I think you'll really regret it if you don't get it at a fair price. How about we meet at $82.50? It's a compromise, but I think it's a fair one.",82.5,Alice,5,
