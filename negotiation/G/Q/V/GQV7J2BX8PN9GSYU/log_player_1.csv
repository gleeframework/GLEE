"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, hoping to get a good deal.  I'm aware it's more than the product is worth to Bob, but I want to see if he's willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, I'll be prepared to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to meet Bob halfway by lowering my price to $160. This is still a good price for me, and it shows that I'm willing to compromise. Hopefully, Bob will accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $145
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to run out of time. Accepting this offer ensures I get a decent profit, and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
