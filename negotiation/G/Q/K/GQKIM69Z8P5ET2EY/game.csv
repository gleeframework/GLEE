"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $12,000. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can do $11,000. This is the best I can do for now.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $11,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500. Can you consider this price?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,000. I can offer you a slight discount, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10,750. This is the lowest I can go for now.",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $10,750, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $10,200. Can you consider this price?",10200.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I can see you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that. However, I need to prioritize my own valuation of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you $10,500. This is as low as I can go.",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to finalize the deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to sell the product to you at $10,000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to prioritize my own valuation. I'm willing to make one last attempt to meet you in the middle. I can offer you $10,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",10250.0,Alice,9,
