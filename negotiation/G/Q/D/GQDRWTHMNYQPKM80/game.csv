"Hi Alice, that's a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I'd only be able to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest but $80 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140? I'm confident you'll find this a fair price for this great product.",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $140 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $100. If you're not able to do that, I'll have to go with John's offer.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $100 just isn't enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $120, which is a significant compromise on my end. Let's see if we can find common ground here.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hesitant about $120. I'm willing to go up to $110. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but $110 still isn't quite enough.  I'm willing to come down to $115 as a final compromise.  If you're serious about getting this product, let's close the deal at this price.",115.0,Alice,7,
