Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I know you'll love. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:**  $120 is higher than your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  $120 is significantly lower than Bob's value of $150, giving him a good incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You can adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is tempting,  it's still worth pushing for a higher price.  We can counteroffer and see if we can meet in the middle at a price closer to our initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  That way we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 110}
```

This counteroffer:

* **Rejects Bob's offer:** Shows you're serious about getting a better price.
* **Offers a compromise:**  Meets Bob halfway, making it more likely he'll accept.
* **Leaves room for further negotiation:** If Bob rejects again, you can adjust your offer slightly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. Would you be willing to meet me at $105? That's the highest I'm comfortable going. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is a good time to accept Bob's offer.  While we could try to push for a higher price, there's a risk Bob will walk away entirely.  $105 is still a good profit for us, and it's likely we won't get a better offer from Bob."
