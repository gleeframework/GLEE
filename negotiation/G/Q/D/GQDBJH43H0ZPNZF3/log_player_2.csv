"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is higher than your maximum budget.
* You know you can get the product from John for $150, which is also above your budget but better than Alice's offer.
* Rejecting Alice's offer might lead to a counter-offer, potentially bringing the price closer to your desired range."
