"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making an offer of $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but how about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  This would be a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. Let me know your thoughts.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're willing to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $10,500, which would be $9,750. This is my final offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",9750.0,Bob,4,
