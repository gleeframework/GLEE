Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have leverage to aim high initially. Starting at $1,500,000 gives you room for negotiation.
* **Potential for Higher Profit:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000, but that doesn't necessarily mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more.  There's a chance he perceives its value to be even higher, especially if it's unique or in high demand. 
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for your minimum price provides a safety net. If Bob declines, you haven't lost anything.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have some time flexibility. If you need to sell the product urgently, a lower, less negotiable offer might be more suitable."
