# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $10000 to me, but I'm willing to offer it to you for $10500. This is a great deal, as you've mentioned its worth to you is also $10000.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer

**Explanation:**

* You are willing to pay up to $10,000 for the product.
* Alice is offering the product for $10,500.
* John is willing to sell the product for $10,000.

Since John's offer is lower than Alice's, it's more advantageous to reject Alice's offer and buy from John."
