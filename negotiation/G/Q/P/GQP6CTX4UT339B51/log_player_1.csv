"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1500000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit while leaving room for negotiation.  I'm hoping Bob values the product highly enough to be willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $1,000,000 is my minimum, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to try to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1250000} 
```

I'm coming down from my initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer is appealing enough to Bob, but still demonstrates that I'm confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still holding out for a better price. While $1,100,000 is tempting, I'm confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiation.  I'm going to try to counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000} 
```

I'm making a smaller concession this time, hoping to find a middle ground with Bob.  I'm confident that I can get a price closer to my desired amount, and I'm willing to compromise a little to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

This is getting close to the time limit, and I'm not confident I can get a better price with Bob. While I'd prefer more, $1,050,000 is a decent profit and I'm willing to accept it to avoid the risk of ending up with only $1,000,000 from John."
