Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value to gauge his interest. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This price allows for some wiggle room to reach a mutually agreeable price without going too low, especially if Bob is serious about buying the product.
* **Positive tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly and positive tone to encourage negotiation. 

**If Bob rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and my options. If his counteroffer is too low, I will make a counteroffer or simply go with John's offer of $15,000.**"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm still a bit above the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While it's a step up from his initial value, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I can't afford to sell it that low.
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:** Bob has shown some flexibility, indicating he's willing to negotiate.  This gives me an opportunity to see if we can bridge the gap with a counteroffer. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I'm comfortable rejecting Bob's offer because I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is much closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm asking for $13,750. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13750} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting halfway:** This counteroffer splits the difference between my previous offer ($14,000) and Bob's offer ($12,500). It shows a willingness to compromise while still maintaining a profitable price.
* **Highlighting value:** The message emphasizes the value of the product, reminding Bob of its potential worth.
* **Leaving room for flexibility:** There's still a bit of wiggle room in this price to potentially reach an agreement with Bob if he's truly interested.  
* **Positive and encouraging tone:** The message remains positive and encourages further negotiation. 

**If Bob rejects this offer, I'll carefully consider his counteroffer.  If it's still too low, I'll consider going with John's offer. **"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $12,750. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  Even with his compromise, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** Bob's offer is getting closer to his initial value, suggesting that he might be unwilling to move much higher. 
* **John's offer is the best option:**  I've reached a point where the potential gains from further negotiation with Bob are outweighed by the certainty of John's offer. 

By selling to John, I secure a guaranteed profit of $15,000, which is significantly better than risking further negotiation with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price."
