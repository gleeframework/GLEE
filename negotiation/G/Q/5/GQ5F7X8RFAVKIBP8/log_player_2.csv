"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you and we believe it's a great investment. We're willing to let you have it for $110 today. Let us know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $110 is a good deal, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get an even lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to spend closer to $100. Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. Considering your offer, I'm willing to sell the product for $105. This allows for a fair compromise while still providing a good profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is good:** $105 is a good price for Bob, as he's aiming for under $120.
* **No need to risk further negotiation:** Bob's counteroffer of $100 was rejected, so further negotiation could lead to Alice becoming less willing to compromise. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  If Bob rejects again, there's a chance Alice will make a higher counteroffer or the negotiation could stall, potentially costing Bob time and potentially making John's offer more appealing."
