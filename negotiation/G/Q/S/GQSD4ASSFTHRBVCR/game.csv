"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $12,000 to me, and I'm confident it would be equally valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,500. This is a fair price that reflects the product's worth and allows me to make a small profit. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.",12500.0,Alice,1,
