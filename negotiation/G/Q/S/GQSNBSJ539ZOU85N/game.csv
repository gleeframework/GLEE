"Bob, thanks for your interest and counter-offer.  I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value this product offers.  What do you say?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
