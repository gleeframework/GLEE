{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price. You have a better chance of getting a good deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with my maximum budget of $1,000,000. This is the best possible outcome for me, and it leaves room for potential negotiation if Alice is willing to come down."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial price, it's still higher than my maximum budget.  I'll try one more counteroffer to see if I can push her down further. There's a chance she might be willing to accept a price closer to my limit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $1,100,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product but I'm still pushing for a price closer to my limit. This gives Alice some room to negotiate without feeling like she's losing too much, while still being a good deal for me."
