"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a unique item that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000. I think it's a fair price considering its value to me, and I believe you'll love it just as much as I do.",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20000 is a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12000.  I think this is a fair price considering I'm willing to buy it right now. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $20000 might be a bit steep, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $18000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $18000 is still higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm happy to pay $15000. This is a fair price considering it's a significant reduction from your original offer. Let's make a deal!",15000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $18000 is still a bit out of your budget, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm thinking of a price of $16500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the value I place on the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",16500.0,Alice,5,
