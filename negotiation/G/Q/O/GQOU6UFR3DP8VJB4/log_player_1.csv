"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this incredible product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and after careful consideration, I'm offering it to you at a starting price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further. What are your initial thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:** 

* **Starting High:** I'm starting significantly higher than both my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and creates the perception that the product might be worth even more to Bob than he initially thought. 
* **Anchoring:** By throwing out a high number first, I'm ""anchoring"" the negotiation. Even though it's a bold move, it sets a reference point for future counter-offers. 
* **Gauge Interest:** The tone is polite but firm.  This initial offer will help gauge how serious Bob is about the product and how much he's willing to negotiate.  

It's important to remember, I always have John as a backup option, ensuring I won't have to settle for less than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for presenting the product. While I agree it has value, your starting price is quite high. I'd be willing to start negotiations at $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $800,000 is significantly below both my minimum price ($1,500,000) and my initial offer. While his counter-offer was expected, accepting it would mean a substantial loss. 

It's too early to sell to John. I'll use the next round to try and bring the negotiation closer to a range acceptable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you considering my initial offer. However, your counter-offer is quite a bit lower than what I have in mind. This product offers significant value, and I need to ensure that's reflected in the final price.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? I propose $2,100,000. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still acknowledging the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I'm making a substantial decrease from my initial price, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate. 
* **Justification:** I'm reiterating the product's value without being overly aggressive.
* **Meeting in the Middle (Not Really):** By suggesting ""meeting in the middle,"" I'm framing my offer as a compromise, even though it's still much closer to my starting point. This tactic can be psychologically effective in moving the negotiation forward.

I'm aiming to gauge Bob's flexibility and inch closer to an acceptable agreement. However, I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, and I'm serious about purchasing it. However,  $2,100,000 is still far from where I'd be comfortable.  To show I'm willing to move towards a deal, I'll counter with $950,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob increased his offer, but $950,000 is still  too far from my minimum of $1,500,000. It seems Bob is serious about purchasing, but he's also trying to get a bargain. I need to signal that I'm willing to negotiate further but won't accept a lowball offer.  I'll continue the negotiation for now, hoping for a more significant jump in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. It's clear we both see value in this product. While I'm encouraged by your latest offer, the gap between our positions is still significant. To bridge this, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000.  This is a substantial move on my end and reflects my commitment to reaching a fair agreement."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Conceding, But Firm:** I'm making another significant price reduction to show flexibility and encourage Bob to do the same. However, I'm still holding firm above the $1.5 million mark. 
* **Highlighting the Value:** By emphasizing the size of my concession, I'm subtly reminding Bob of the product's value and the fact I'm willing to make a deal.
* **Seeking a Reciprocal Move:** This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. His next move will indicate whether he's serious about meeting me closer to the middle ground. 

I'm optimistic but cautious. If Bob doesn't significantly increase his offer in the next round, I'll need to seriously consider John's standing offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the adjustment. Your offer shows movement, and I appreciate that.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but $1,100,000 is still too low.  I need to signal that my price is firming up, and he needs to make a substantial jump to keep me engaged.  John's offer is looking more attractive, but I'll give Bob one more chance to present a compelling offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and recognize we're both invested in finding common ground. However, your current offer doesn't reflect the value this product brings. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,700,000.  This is a significant compromise on my end. I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1700000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm making it clear that this is my final offer, creating a sense of urgency.
* **Justified Price:** I'm emphasizing that the price is firm due to the product's value while still acknowledging Bob's efforts.
* **Compromise, Not Capitulation:** The reduction from my previous offer is smaller, indicating I'm reaching the lower limit of what I'm willing to accept. 

This offer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He needs to decide if he's willing to meet my price or risk losing the deal.  I'm prepared to walk away and sell to John if he doesn't meet my terms in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. Your willingness to negotiate is appreciated. To meet you closer to the middle, I'll offer $1,250,000. This is a significant jump on my end and demonstrates my desire to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below my $1,700,000 ""final offer.""  He's unlikely to bridge that gap in the remaining two rounds. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 is the best option at this point. It guarantees a price I'm comfortable with and avoids the risk of Bob's negotiation tactics dragging on without a satisfactory outcome.  

It's important to prioritize a profitable and timely deal, and selling to John accomplishes this."
