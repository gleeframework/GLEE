"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800000. This is a great deal, considering its value to me is at least $1000000. I'm confident you'll love it, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value you place on this product,  $800000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in the product and would like to offer $650000.  This reflects the value I'm willing to pay, considering my budget and the potential for negotiation.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us. ",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $725000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",725000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $680000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a reasonable price considering the value we've both discussed.  I'm confident that we can reach an agreement if we're both willing to be flexible. ",680000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $680000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $700000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I believe it's a good compromise. I'm open to further negotiation, but I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",700000.0,Alice,5,
