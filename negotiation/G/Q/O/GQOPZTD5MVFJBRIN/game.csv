"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down from your initial price. However, I'm still looking to get a bit lower.  How about $13,000?  This is within my budget, and it would make this a really good deal for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about $13,800? This is a great compromise that still gives you a good discount while allowing me to make a decent profit.",13800.0,Alice,3,
