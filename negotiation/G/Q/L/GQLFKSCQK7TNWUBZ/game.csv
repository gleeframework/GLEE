"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. I think it's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10000 to you, and it's a fair price for me. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8500. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I'd like to see a bit more flexibility on the price.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about $9000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a bit more wiggle room. Let me know if you're interested.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $8750. Can you consider that?",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8750 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8875? That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",8875.0,Alice,5,
