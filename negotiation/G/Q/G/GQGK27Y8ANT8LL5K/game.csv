"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to  $800,000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,200,000 is still a little steep for me.  How about we settle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $1,100,000, but that's my final offer.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
