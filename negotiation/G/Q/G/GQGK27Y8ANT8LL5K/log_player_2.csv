"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest.  While I understand your perspective, $800,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $1,200,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still quite a bit below what I had in mind.  To be frank, I have another buyer interested at a higher price.  I'm willing to let it go to you for $1,100,000, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

Reason: Alice seems firm on her price and is unlikely to go much lower than $1,100,000.  It's not worth the risk of continued negotiation when you have a guaranteed option with John at $1,000,000."
