Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 425000}

Alice is increasing her price, which is a clear sign that she's not willing to negotiate further. With only two rounds left, we need to secure the product. While $1,200,000 from John is higher than our ideal price, it's still within our budget and ensures we get the product."
