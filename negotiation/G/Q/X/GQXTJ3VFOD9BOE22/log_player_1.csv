Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this valuable product for $1,450,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it leaves room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1450000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit too high for me. Could we work something out closer to $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price, but I won't settle for such a significant discount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This reflects the value of the product to both of us and gives us a good starting point for further negotiations. Let's find common ground and make this happen."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,300,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,200,000? This seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
``` 

Bob's offer is at my minimum price point, but given that I have a guaranteed buyer in John, there's no reason to risk further negotiation. Selling to John ensures a guaranteed profit and avoids the potential for further rounds of counteroffers that might lead to a lower price."
