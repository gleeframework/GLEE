"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  While it's a good deal, he can likely do better. He has 10 rounds to negotiate and knows Alice is willing to sell for less than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about $9500?  It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's already gotten her down to $9,500, and he knows her minimum is $8,000.  He has more rounds left and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9,250. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9250 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $9375? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He knows Alice is willing to sell for less than $9,375, as she's already lowered her price multiple times. He has more rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less. I'm offering $9,200 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.  Let me know if you're ready to accept."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I hear you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250? This way we can both be happy with the deal. Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he could continue to negotiate, there's a high chance Alice will reject his next counteroffer, leaving him with only a few rounds left. Accepting her offer of $9,250 is a good deal for him, as he's saving $2,750 compared to buying from John.  He's also getting the product for less than his maximum value."
