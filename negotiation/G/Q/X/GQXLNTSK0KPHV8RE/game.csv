"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. While I appreciate your interest, $9000 is a bit too low for me. How about $9500?  It's still a great deal for you considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $9500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $9250. It's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen.",9250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9250 is still a bit low. How about we meet in the middle at $9375? This price is fair for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  Let's make this happen.",9375.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still looking to pay a bit less. I'm offering $9200 for the product.  I think this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm ready to close the deal now.  Let me know if you're ready to accept.",9200.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I hear you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9200 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9250? This way we can both be happy with the deal. Let's make this happen! ",9250.0,Alice,7,
