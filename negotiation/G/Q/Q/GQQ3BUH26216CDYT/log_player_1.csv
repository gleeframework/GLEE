Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000.

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $1,350,000 is a good price, I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1,350,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1325000. Can we discuss further?

While $1,325,000 is tempting, I'm still not comfortable with that price. I think I can push Bob a little further and see if we can find a compromise. I'll reject his offer and try to counter."

I'll reject Bob's offer again. While $1,300,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get a higher price. I'll counter with a slightly lower offer to see if we can find a compromise."

I've had 8 rounds of negotiations with Bob, and we're still far apart. I'm starting to run out of time, and it doesn't seem like Bob is going to budge much further.  I don't want to risk losing out entirely, so I'll take John's offer of $1,200,000."
