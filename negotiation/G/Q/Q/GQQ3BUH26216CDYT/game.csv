"I'm interested in the product, but $1500000 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1350000?",1350000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  However, $1350000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1400000. It's a fair compromise, and I believe it reflects the true value of this product. Let's see if we can close the deal.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1400000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $1325000. Can we discuss further?",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to meet you in the middle again, but I can't go lower than $1375000. This is a substantial offer, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny.  What do you say?",1375000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm running out of room to negotiate.  I can't go lower than $1350000.  This is my final offer.  I believe this product is a valuable investment for you, and this price reflects its worth. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Alice,7,
