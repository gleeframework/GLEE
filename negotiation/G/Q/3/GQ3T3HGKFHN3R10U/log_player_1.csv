Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $11,999. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible, which is her guaranteed sale price to John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher sale price than $12,000.
* **Avoid Appearing Greedy:**  Offering it at $12,000 to Bob might seem like Alice isn't willing to negotiate at all and could make Bob less likely to engage.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and increasing the likelihood of a successful sale to Bob."
