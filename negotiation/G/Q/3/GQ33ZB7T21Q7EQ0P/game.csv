"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,000,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,100,000 to make this worthwhile. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,150,000?  It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to close this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to meet you halfway from our previous discussion, so I'm offering $1,025,000. I'm confident that this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it at this price.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference again. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to achieve my target. I'm confident we can close this deal.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're close, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1,050,000, which is as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
