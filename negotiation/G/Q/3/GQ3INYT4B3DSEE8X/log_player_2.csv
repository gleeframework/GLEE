"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $900,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $900,000 is tempting, you know you have a backup option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you create an opportunity for her to potentially lower the price, getting you a better deal."
