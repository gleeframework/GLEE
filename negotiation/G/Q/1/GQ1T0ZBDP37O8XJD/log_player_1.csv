Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $18,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $14,000 is too low for me, and I'm confident I can get a better price. I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I still believe I can get a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $14,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $15,500 for the product. I'm confident this price is fair considering the value, and I'm eager to close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $15,500 is a good price, and it's close to my minimum acceptable price. It's better than selling to John for $15,000, and I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially lose even more money."
