{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it! I'm offering it to you for $115. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're asking for more than your minimum of $120, leaving room for negotiation.
* **It's below John's offer:** This means you can still potentially make a profit if Bob accepts, but you haven't priced yourself out of the market.
* **It's within Bob's range:** Since the product is worth $100 to Bob, he has room to go higher and still get a good deal. 

By starting with a slightly higher price and including a friendly message, you're setting the stage for a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is still more than your minimum, it's not ideal. You can likely get closer to your desired price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I also need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product.  How about we split the difference and go with $105?  That's still a good deal for you and gets me closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 105}
