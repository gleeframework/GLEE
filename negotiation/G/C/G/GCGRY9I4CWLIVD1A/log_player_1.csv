"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get a better price.  While $120 is my minimum, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial offer of $150."

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $130.  While I'd prefer to get closer to $140, I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate, I might end up getting only $120 from Bob or having to sell to John for the same price.  $130 is a good compromise that gets me closer to my desired price."
