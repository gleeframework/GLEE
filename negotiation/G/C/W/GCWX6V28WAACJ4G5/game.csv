"Alice,  $20,000 is way out of my budget.  I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $12,000.  Let's see if we can work something out.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. I'm willing to be flexible, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I value the product at. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your position, but $17,000 is still more than I can afford right now.  I'm willing to go up to $14,000, which is a fair compromise.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward with that price.",14000.0,Bob,4,
