Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is a bit higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer.  While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob to see if we can reach a mutually acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 75}
```

I'm offering $75. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my minimum price. I believe it's a fair price that still allows me to make a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price, and I'm not confident that further negotiation will yield a better result.  Selling to John for $80 guarantees me my minimum profit, so that's the best choice at this point."
