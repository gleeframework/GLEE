"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows me to see if Bob is truly interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500, but that's my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. $9,500 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,200 for the product. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $9,200 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still believe I can get a better deal. It's risky to sell to Bob right now, as it's possible to get a better offer. I'll see if I can push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but I'm not able to go any lower than $9,400. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know if you're able to reach this point."", ""product_price"": 9400} 
```

I'm sticking to my guns and offering a price that's just a little lower than my previous offer. I'm hoping that this small concession will be enough to entice Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $9,400 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you reconsider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We've reached a stalemate with Bob. It seems like he's unwilling to budge on his price.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum acceptable price and avoids further negotiation."
