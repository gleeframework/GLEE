"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing item. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 

While Alice's offer is lower than her product's value, it's still significantly higher than your $800,000 limit and what John offers.  You can do better by rejecting this offer."
