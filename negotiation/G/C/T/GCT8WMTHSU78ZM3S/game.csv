"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While $1,200,000 is certainly a respectable figure, the true value of this product is significantly higher, as I'm sure you recognize.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,275,000? This reflects the value it brings while acknowledging your desire for a fair deal.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
