"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle.",11250.0,Alice,5,
