# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,000. It's a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than the $10,000 he's willing to pay.  He can still try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your desire for a compromise, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,250. It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250

While Alice has lowered her price to $11,250, Bob has a better option available. He can buy the product from John for $10,000, saving himself $1,250. There's no need to continue negotiating with Alice at this point."
