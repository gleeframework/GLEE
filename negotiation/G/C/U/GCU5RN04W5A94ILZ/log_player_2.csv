"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to let you have it for $100. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Your goal:** Save money while still buying the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $100
* **Your maximum willingness to pay:** $120
* **John's price:** $120

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $20 compared to buying from John.  While you could potentially negotiate further with Alice, the risk of losing the product to John outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price."
