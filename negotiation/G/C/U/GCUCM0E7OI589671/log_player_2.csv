"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You're willing to pay up to $1,500,000, but her starting offer is already $100,000 more than your absolute maximum. 
* **There's room for negotiation.**  Since Alice's offer is already above her minimum, there's a potential for a deal that benefits both of you.
* **Rejecting the offer keeps your options open.** You can make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price. If negotiations fail, you can always buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,300,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start with a significant reduction:** My counteroffer is $100,000 lower than Alice's initial price. This shows that I'm serious about negotiating and that I'm not going to accept her first offer.
* **Stay within my budget:**  $1,300,000 is still within my maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* **Leave room for compromise:** This counteroffer gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to potentially save a substantial amount of money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice has moved closer to my desired price:** Her new offer is $50,000 lower than her previous offer, showing that she's willing to negotiate.
* **The price is within my budget:** $1,350,000 is still within my maximum of $1,500,000.
* **Accepting saves time and potential negotiation headaches:** While further negotiation might be possible, the current price is reasonable. Accepting saves time and avoids potential issues if Alice becomes less flexible."
