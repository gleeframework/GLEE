"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this valuable product. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $11,500 is a good price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While the product seems great, I'm only able to go up to $10,500 right now.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:** This counteroffer is aggressive, but still leaves room for Alice to negotiate. It's a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, signaling Bob's serious intent to save money.
* **Justification:** The message provides a reason for the counteroffer, highlighting Bob's budget constraints while still expressing interest in the product. 
* **Leaving Room for Compromise:**  A $1,000 gap allows for potential back-and-forth negotiation in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but I'm confident this product is worth more to you in the long run. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to potentially push for a lower price. There's still room to haggle, and Bob has already shown he's willing to walk away if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still a bit above my budget at $11,000. How about we try $10,750? It's a fair compromise that hopefully works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This counteroffer splits the difference between Bob's previous offer of $10,500 and Alice's offer of $11,000. This signals Bob's willingness to compromise while still attempting to get a good deal.
* **Continuing the Negotiation:**  A smaller gap between offers increases the chances of reaching an agreement in the next round.
* **Maintaining a Friendly Tone:** The message remains polite and acknowledges Alice's perspective, keeping the negotiation constructive."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this product and I respect that.  Let's try $10,900. I'm confident this is a fair price that reflects the value it will bring you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Budget:** $10,900 is very close to Bob's maximum budget of $12,000, making it a good deal.
* **Potential for Future Savings:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to buy from John at a higher price outweighs the potential savings.
* **Time Factor:**  Five rounds have already passed, and further negotiation could prolong the process. Accepting this offer ensures a deal with Alice within a reasonable timeframe."
