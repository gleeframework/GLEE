Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it well worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Gain:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you should aim higher with Bob to see if you can secure a better deal.
* **Strategic Starting Point:**  Offering the product at $1,500,000 gives you room to negotiate down if needed while still aiming for a significant profit above your minimum.
* **Confident Presentation:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and your belief in its worth, encouraging Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. You can always adjust your price downwards towards $1,200,000 (your guaranteed sale price) if necessary."
