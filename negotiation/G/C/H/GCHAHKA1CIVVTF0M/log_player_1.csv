Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its worth and the benefit it will bring to you."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000 (John), you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""value"" to justify the high price, even though the specific value proposition isn't stated in the prompt.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy is aggressive. Bob might outright reject the offer without negotiation, leading you to John (your guaranteed $1,000,000). 
* Consider your risk tolerance. If you want to ensure a sale and are willing to accept a lower price for a quick deal, a lower initial offer might be more suitable."
