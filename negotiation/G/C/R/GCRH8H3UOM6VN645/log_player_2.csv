You can do better than $1,000,000.  Reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $950000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1200000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

$950,000 is a good deal for you. It's less than your maximum price and still gives Alice a profit."
