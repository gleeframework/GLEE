"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. This is a fantastic deal, as it's significantly lower than what I could get elsewhere. It's also a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is lower than her product's worth to her, you know you can get a better deal from John for $1,000,000.  You're better off rejecting Alice's offer and going with John."
