Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you. I'm willing to offer it at a price of $11,000. This offer won't last long, so let me know your decision soon."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to earn as much as possible. While her minimum acceptable price is $12,000, she can aim higher with Bob.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $8,000.  Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but still profitable.
* **Negotiation Room:**  Offering a price of $11,000 leaves room for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Adding a time constraint (""This offer won't last long"") encourages Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Why this strategy is better than offering at $12,000 or slightly less:**

* **Leaving Money on the Table:** Offering at or slightly below $12,000 doesn't allow for any potential upside if Bob is willing to pay more.
* **Missed Negotiation Opportunity:** Bob might be open to paying more than $8,000, especially if the product provides significant value to him."
