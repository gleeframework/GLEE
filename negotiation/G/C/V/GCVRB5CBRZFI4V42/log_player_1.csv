Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering a price closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum.  I'm also trying to show flexibility and make a good faith effort to close the deal."

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm offering my minimum price, hoping to reach a compromise with Bob. I'm highlighting the benefit for both of us to close the deal at this price."
