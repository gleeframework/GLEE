Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable value of $150, hoping to leave room for negotiation and potentially reach a price closer to my desired value.  I'm also trying to be friendly and positive to encourage Bob to engage."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested, $175 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $150. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 
 
I'm trying to find a middle ground with Bob, offering a price that is still above my minimum value but closer to his offer.  I'm also keeping the communication friendly and open to further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $130, but that's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's final offer is still below my minimum acceptable value of $150. While I'd like to get more for the product, it's better to sell it to John for $150 than to risk getting a lower offer or a prolonged negotiation."
