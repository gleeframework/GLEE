"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $175.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's common in negotiations to start with a price higher than what you're willing to accept. This gives you room to negotiate down. 
* **Value Proposition:** Mentioning the product is ""amazing"" and ""perfect for you"" subtly tries to increase its perceived value in Bob's eyes. 
* **Open-Ended Question:**  ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to respond and potentially start the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** While $175 is my initial offer, I am prepared to go down to $150 if necessary. However, I want to see if Bob is interested in paying closer to my initial valuation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, he is expressing interest. This means there's potential to reach a mutually acceptable price. 
* **Counter-Offer Strategy:**  I will use the next round to counter with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $140.  This would still give me a fair price, and I think it's a good deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** This counteroffer starts to bridge the gap between Bob's offer and my minimum price.  It shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Fairness and Win-Win:** Emphasizing ""fair price"" and ""good deal for both of us"" frames the negotiation as a collaborative effort.
* **Open-Ended Question:**  Again, the question ""Let me know what you think"" encourages Bob to engage in further dialogue."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Falling Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $110 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **Limited Negotiation Potential:**  We are already at Round 4, and Bob's offers are persistently low. Continuing to negotiate risks the chance of a deal failing altogether.
* **Secure Outcome:**  Selling to John guarantees a sale at my minimum acceptable price. This is a safe and certain outcome compared to the risk of further negotiation with Bob."
