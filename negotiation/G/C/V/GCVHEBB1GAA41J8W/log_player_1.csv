{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a unique product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth a lot to me, so I'm asking for $15,000. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($10,000). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  I'm emphasizing the product's value to me, hoping to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm open to discussing the price, but I'm not giving away my minimum value yet. 

**Strategy:**

By starting high, I'm aiming to see if Bob is genuinely interested in the product and willing to pay a premium. If he counteroffers, I'll assess his offer and potentially make a counter-counteroffer, always keeping in mind my $10,000 minimum.  

**Important Note:** This is just a starting point.  My next move will depend on Bob's response, and I'll adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Than Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 is above my minimum of $10,000.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:**  I believe there's still room for negotiation. Since Bob is interested, I want to see if I can get closer to my initial asking price. 

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I'm signaling that I'm not desperate to sell and that I'm hoping for a better deal. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to secure a price closer to $13,000 or $14,000. This will show Bob that I'm serious about the product's value while still being open to negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product! While $12,000 is a good offer, I'm hoping for something closer to $14,000 to make this work. This unique product is worth a lot to me, and I believe its value will exceed your expectations.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm acknowledging Bob's offer and showing flexibility by coming down from my initial $15,000.
* **Reiterating Value:** I'm again emphasizing the product's unique qualities and potential value to Bob. 
* **Open to Further Discussion:** I'm using an inviting tone and open-ended question to encourage further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

My goal is to strike a balance between being firm on my desired price and showing willingness to compromise. By offering $14,000, I'm hoping to find a middle ground that satisfies both of us.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll need to reassess my options and decide whether to drop the price further or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that the product is unique, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $14000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Desired Price:** Bob's offer of $13,500 is very close to my desired price range. 
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  Continuing to negotiate could lead to a lower offer or a longer, drawn-out process.  There's also the risk that Bob might lose interest completely.
* **Secure Profit:** Accepting the offer guarantees a sale at a price that significantly exceeds my minimum.

**Strategy:**

While I would have preferred to get closer to $14,000,  accepting Bob's offer at $13,500 represents a good deal that maximizes my profit and minimizes the risk of further negotiation.  It's a good outcome, considering that I could have sold to John for only $10,000."
