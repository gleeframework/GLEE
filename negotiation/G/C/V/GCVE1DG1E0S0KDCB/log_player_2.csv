"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be of great value to you, for $11,500. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice at $11,500 is cheaper than buying from John at $12,000.
* Although the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, she's still offering it for more than that, indicating potential for negotiation, but that's not within the scope of this prompt.  
* The goal is to save money, and accepting Alice's offer achieves that."
