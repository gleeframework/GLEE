Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be of great value to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without scaring him off.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:** Offering $11,500 leaves a little wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate a lower price.
* **Above My Minimum:** It's crucial that the offer is significantly above my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) to ensure a good profit."
