While Bob's offer is better than before, we are down to the wire and I need to secure a deal.  I'm not sure if I can push for a better price in the next round, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely.  John's offer of $1,200,000 is still above my minimum, so I'm going to accept it and sell to him."
