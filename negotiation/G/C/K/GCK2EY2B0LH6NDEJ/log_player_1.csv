Round 2
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $90 is better than nothing, I'm confident I can get closer to my target price with a counteroffer."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105, which is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 105}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While $95 is closer to my minimum, I still believe there's room for negotiation to get closer to $105."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. How about we split the difference and go with $100?  That's still a fair price for the value you'll get from this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
