Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,999. I think it's a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum acceptable price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high but below Bob's maximum gives the impression of a deal while still leaving room for potential negotiation if Bob counter-offers.
* **Secure Sale:** Offering it slightly below Bob's maximum might incentivize him to buy it immediately rather than risk losing the deal. 
 
This strategy aims to secure a sale at a price significantly higher than John's offer while still being appealing to Bob."
