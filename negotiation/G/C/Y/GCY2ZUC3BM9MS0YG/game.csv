"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the opportunity, $1,200,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,000,000 for the product. This reflects the value I see in it and allows for a fair profit margin for you.  Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $1,100,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,050,000. This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us. Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
