Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but $120 is a bit steep for me. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
