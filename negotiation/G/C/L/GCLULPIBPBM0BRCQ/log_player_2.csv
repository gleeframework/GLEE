Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000.  This product is truly unique and holds significant value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is my final offer, and it's the best I can do.  If we can't reach an agreement at this price, I'll have to explore other options.

*  Although she claims it's her final offer,  there's no guarantee that she won't counteroffer again in the next round.
*  I've already spent several rounds negotiating, and I'm not confident I can get the price down to my target. 
* Buying from John at $800,000 ensures I get the product within my budget and saves me time and potential frustration with further negotiation."
