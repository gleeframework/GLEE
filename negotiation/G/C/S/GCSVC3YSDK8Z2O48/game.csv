"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $10,500.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to me and leaves room for both of us to benefit from the deal.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product's value is worth more than $10,500. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,250. This price still reflects the product's true value, but I'm willing to compromise to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $11,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750.  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to make this happen.",10750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $11,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",11100.0,Alice,5,
