{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer gives me a significant profit, yet it's still within the range of what Bob might be willing to pay, making it a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the value I'll be getting from the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $900,000 is closer to my minimum than my initial offer, I still believe I can get a better price. I'll try to negotiate further with Bob before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I value your interest, $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which reflects the value you'll gain and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my budget. I'd like to propose a counteroffer of $920,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $920,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price than my previous counteroffer.  It's also a significant improvement over his initial offer. I don't want to risk losing the sale completely by continuing to negotiate.  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit, and it's the best option at this point."
