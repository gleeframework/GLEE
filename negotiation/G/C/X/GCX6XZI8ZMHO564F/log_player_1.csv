Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $15,000.  What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting with a higher price ($15,000) leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters. It also reinforces the idea that the product is valuable.
* **Polite but Firm:** The message is friendly but emphasizes my valuation of the product. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's response to maximize my potential earnings."
