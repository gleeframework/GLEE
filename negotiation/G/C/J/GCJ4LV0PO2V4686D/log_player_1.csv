"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting high, aiming to maximize my profit. Since the product is worth $10,000 to me, I'm offering a price that's $1,000 above that. While it's likely Bob will reject this, it establishes a starting point and allows me to gauge his willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is tempting, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I'll reject Bob's offer and counter in the next round. This keeps the negotiation open and gives me more leverage."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price to $10,500. This is still above my minimum, but shows I'm willing to compromise. I'm hoping Bob sees this as a fair price considering his initial offer of $9,500."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. I have a guaranteed $10,000 from John, so I'm not desperate to accept anything less."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping my price to $10,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. This is a significant concession but I'm hoping Bob will see it as a fair price considering his previous offer. If he rejects this, I'll have no choice but to sell to John in the next round."
