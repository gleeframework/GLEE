"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $110. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

``` 

While $110 is less than your maximum budget, you can likely get a better price by rejecting Alice's offer. This will lead you to buy from John for $120, but you can still try to negotiate a lower price with him since you know Alice was willing to sell for less."
