"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,000,000. This price represents a significant value for you, considering the product is worth $1,200,000 to your company. I'm confident it will be a profitable investment for you. Please let me know your decision by [date/time]. If you decline, I'll be selling it to John for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is bluffing:** She claims she'll sell to John for less than her product is worth to her. This is unlikely as it means a loss for Alice. 
* **You have leverage:** You know John will sell to you at $1,200,000, which is your maximum price. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** By rejecting Alice's offer, you might be able to negotiate a lower price with her or see if she'll counter-offer. 

While accepting Alice's offer would get you the product, there's a strong chance you can get it for less by calling her bluff."
