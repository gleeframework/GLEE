"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11000. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least $12000 to you. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, you can likely do better by counteroffering. You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, you can explore if a lower price is possible."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the deal, I'm looking to spend a bit less. I'm willing to pay $9,500 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **Significant Discount:** It's a $1,500 discount from Alice's offer, showing you're serious about a lower price.
* **Above Alice's Value:**  It's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice, so she has incentive to negotiate.
* **Leaves Room for Compromise:** It allows for potential compromise during further rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about $10000?  It's still a great deal for you, considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting her offer allows you to continue exploring a lower price.  You know the product is worth $8,000 to Alice, so there's still potential to get a deal that's better than $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $9,750. This would still be a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a final agreement."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increase:** This counteroffer is a slight increase from your previous offer, showing you're willing to compromise but still pushing for a better price.
* **Close to Alice's Value:**  It's closer to Alice's value, but still leaves a good margin for her.
* **Signal of Finality:**  The message implies that this may be your final offer, putting pressure on Alice to accept."
