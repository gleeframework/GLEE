"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its worth to both of us, let me start with an offer of $9,500. Looking forward to your response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's lower than John's price, it's still above the product's worth to you ($10,000).  
* **Negotiation is worth trying:** You have 10 rounds and a clear goal of saving money.  Rejecting allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. However, $9,500 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, recognizing its value to both of us. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your position and would like to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $9,000 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's moved closer to your target, it's still above the product's worth to you ($10,000).
* **More negotiation is needed:**  You have 7 rounds left, and there's still room for Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for being flexible.  While I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $9,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  This would represent a good deal for both of us and allow us to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your continued interest in our product. I've reviewed our previous discussions and am willing to consider $8,900 as a final offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product to both of us and I hope you can accept this offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget:** $8,900 is less than your $10,000 limit.
* **Further negotiation is unlikely:** You've already made several counteroffers and Alice has been firm in her stance. It's unlikely she'll lower the price significantly further.
* **Time is a factor:** You only have 5 rounds left, and it's not guaranteed that Alice will accept your counteroffer if you reject this one. 

While you could try to negotiate a bit more, accepting this offer minimizes your risk of not closing the deal and having to buy from John at a higher price."
