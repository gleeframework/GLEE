{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

This offer starts at a high price, but it's below my minimum value of $1,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a good price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I think the price is a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $850,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than my minimum value of $1,000,000. I will try to negotiate a higher price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a fair compromise that hopefully allows us to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to compromise, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $825,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not willing to drop my price that much further.  It's better for me to sell to John at the $1,000,000 price and guarantee a sale that meets my minimum requirements."
