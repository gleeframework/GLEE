{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}

I'm starting with a price of $9,000, which is slightly above my minimum value of $8,000. This gives me some room to negotiate and allows me to potentially make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product is high to you, but I'm only able to pay up to $8,000 for it. Would you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000.
