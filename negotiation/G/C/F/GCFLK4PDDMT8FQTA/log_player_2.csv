"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice and see if you can get a lower price. There's a good chance Alice is willing to negotiate since she's starting so high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This signals my serious intent to purchase but also my understanding of the product's value to me. I'm aiming for a substantial discount, but leaving room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my maximum budget, but it's closer than her initial offer. I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe there's still room for a lower price. Buying from John at this point would be too costly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise. However, it's still below Alice's latest offer and within my acceptable range.  I'm hoping to find a middle ground with Alice in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now within my budget and is the best offer so far. While I could continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, there's a risk that Alice could reject my counteroffer or increase her price. It's safer to accept this offer and avoid risking going over my budget or missing the opportunity altogether."
