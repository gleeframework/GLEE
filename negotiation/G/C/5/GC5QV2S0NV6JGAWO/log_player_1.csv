Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it's something you'll find valuable. I'm asking for $150."",
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While I know Bob values the product at $100, I'm starting with a higher offer ($150) to see if there's room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:** This leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle.  Even if Bob negotiates down, I'm still likely to get a better price than John's guaranteed $100.
* **Backup Plan:** The safety net of John's offer allows me to be more ambitious in my initial ask to Bob."
