"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll find valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $20000.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",18000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $18000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway at $19500. This is my final counteroffer for now.",19500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $19500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $17000. Would you be willing to consider this price?",17000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $18500, which is a bit lower than my previous offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. This is my next best offer.",18500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $18500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $17500 for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",17500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to the bottom line. I can do $18000, which is my absolute minimum, but I'm willing to meet you at $17500. However, I need to be honest with you, I'm also considering selling the product to someone else if we can't come to an agreement. I'll give you one more chance to meet me at $17500. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",18000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're considering other options, but I'm still very interested in buying the product from you. I'm willing to meet you at $17500, but I'd like to throw in a small concession: I'll also throw in an additional $500 for any additional services you can provide with the product. Would you be willing to accept this offer?",17500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional offer, but I'm still not willing to go below $18000. However, I'm willing to consider the additional services you mentioned. I'll meet you at $17500, but I need the additional services to be worth at least $500, and I want a written guarantee that they will be provided. If you can meet me on these conditions, I'll consider your offer.",17500.0,Alice,9,
