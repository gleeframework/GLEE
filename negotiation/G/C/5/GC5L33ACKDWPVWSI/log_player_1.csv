Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, making him feel more in control and potentially leading to a quicker sale.
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the ""unique value and potential,"" you subtly justify the high price without revealing your absolute bottom line.

This strategy aims to secure the highest possible price from Bob while keeping your fallback option with John secure."
