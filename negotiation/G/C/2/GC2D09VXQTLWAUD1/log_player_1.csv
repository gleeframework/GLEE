Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I see the value in the product, but  $2,300,000 is not feasible for me.  How about we bring it down to $1,000,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand we're both trying to find a good deal here. While $1,900,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more manageable. Would you consider $1,200,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still under. I have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000. It's not worth the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob."
