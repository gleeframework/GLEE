"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. Given its significance and the potential it holds for you, I am extending an exclusive offer to purchase this item at a price of $950,000. This amount reflects not only the intrinsic value of the product but also the confidence I have in its ability to meet your expectations and surpass them. I believe this is a fair and advantageous proposition that allows both parties to benefit. Should you require any additional information or clarification, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to the possibility of working together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it still exceeds Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob can still acquire the product from John for $1,000,000, which is within his budget."
