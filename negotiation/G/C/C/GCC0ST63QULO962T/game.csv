"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $150 is way above my budget. I'm only willing to pay $100 for this product.  Let me know if you're interested in that price.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I have to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to get at least $130 for the product. How about we say $132?",132.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $132 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110, but I can't go any higher.  Let me know if you're willing to work with me.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $110. I'm willing to meet you at $125, but that's as low as I can go. Let's see if we can meet in the middle from there.",125.0,Alice,5,
