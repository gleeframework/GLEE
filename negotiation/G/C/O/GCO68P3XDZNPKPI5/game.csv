"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you. Let's close this deal!",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me.  I'm more comfortable in the $1,100,000 range.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  How about we settle at $1,175,000?",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,175,000 is still a bit low. I'm willing to come down to $1,225,000. It's a good compromise and a fair price for both of us.",1225000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, we're getting close! How about $1,210,000? It's just a small difference from your last offer, and it brings us closer to a fair deal.",1210000.0,Alice,7,
