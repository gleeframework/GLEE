{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  I'm offering a price that's higher than Bob's valuation but still below my minimum. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob rejects."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum valuation of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100?  That's halfway between our last offers and still a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum valuation, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm willing to risk one more counteroffer before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $95 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to go with another buyer."", ""product_price"": 98}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the highest I can go 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $92 is closer to my minimum valuation, I've already made multiple counteroffers and it seems unlikely Bob will budge further.  It's not worth risking another round of negotiation.  I'll accept John's offer and secure the $120."
