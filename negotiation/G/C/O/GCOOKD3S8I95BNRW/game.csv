"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Would you be willing to meet me halfway?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $90 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about $100?  That's halfway between our last offers and still a fair price considering the value of the product.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but $100 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me at $95?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $95 is still a bit low. I'm willing to go down to $98. This is a fair compromise, and I hope you'll consider it. If not, I'll have to go with another buyer.",98.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $98 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $92. That's the highest I can go",92.0,Bob,6,
