I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm happy with $150, I want to see if I can push for a higher price.  I still have 9 rounds left."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. Would you consider $165? It's a fair price for the value of this product."", ""product_price"": 165}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your response. I appreciate your product, but I am only able to offer $150 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is firm at $150, and I've already rejected his offer twice.  With only 6 rounds left, I don't want to risk getting stuck with the minimum. Selling to John for $150 guarantees me the minimum I'm willing to accept, so I'll choose that option."
