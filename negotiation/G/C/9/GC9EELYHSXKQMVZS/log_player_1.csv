Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I think it's worth at least $100, but I'm willing to let it go for $90.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

I'm starting with a price a bit higher than my minimum, hoping to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get closer to my ideal price.  Let's see what he says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $90. I'm willing to pay $75 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $75 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum of $80. I'm going to try and get a better deal from Bob.  Let's see if I can get him to come up a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $75 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $85. It's a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm going to try to meet Bob halfway. $85 is still above my minimum and I think it's a reasonable compromise. Let's see if he's willing to budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $85, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $82.50. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Okay, $82.50 is a little less than I'd hoped, but it's above my minimum and  closer to what I'm willing to accept.  Let's seal the deal with Bob."
