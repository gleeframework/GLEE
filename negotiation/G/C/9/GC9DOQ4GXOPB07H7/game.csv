"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm happy to offer $17000 for it. Let me know what you think.",17000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  $17000 is a bit too low for me right now, but I'm willing to come down a little.  How about $18500? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the opportunity it offers.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",18500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  $18500 is still a bit higher than my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $17500.  Let's see if we can close the deal at this price.",17500.0,Bob,4,
