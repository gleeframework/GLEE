"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I could potentially make  $700,000 work. Would that be agreeable to you?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it.",850000.0,Alice,5,
