"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to start our negotiation. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. While it's good to be polite, I can definitely get a better price, either through further negotiation with Alice or by going to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a price closer to $600,000?"",
""product_price"": 600000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. After reconsidering, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down in price, but it's still above my maximum and John's offer. I'll try to negotiate a bit more, but I'm keeping John in mind as a backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. To be honest, $900,000 is still a stretch for me. I could potentially make  $700,000 work. Would that be agreeable to you?"",
""product_price"": 700000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the value of the product, I'm willing to offer you a compromise at $850,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $850,000. It's time to cut my losses and go with John's offer of $800,000.  While I might be able to squeeze a few more dollars out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of her walking away and me ending up with nothing."
