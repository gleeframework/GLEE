"Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

This is a clear case of rejecting Alice's offer.  $2,000,000 is way over your budget, and you have a guaranteed alternative with John for $1,000,000.  It's worth seeing if you can get Alice to come down in price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

This counteroffer starts the negotiation at your maximum price. It's a bold move, but Alice is likely to counter. You can then adjust your offer based on her response."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is still too high.  You're still better off with John, but it's worth trying to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying from Alice, but you're not willing to pay her full asking price.  It's a compromise, but it also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,700,000 is getting closer to your maximum, it's still worth pushing for a lower price. It's likely Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since you've demonstrated a willingness to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

You're getting closer to Alice's price, but still trying to keep it under your maximum.  This shows commitment without giving in completely."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,680,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,680,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to a price that's within your budget, and you're only $680,000 above your guaranteed price from John.  It's a good deal, and it's probably worth taking to avoid the risk of further negotiation."
