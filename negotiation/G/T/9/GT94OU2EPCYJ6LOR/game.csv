"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd like to see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but $9,000 is significantly lower than what I can accept.  This product offers you substantial value, and I'm confident it's worth a closer price to my initial offer. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I think we can get closer to my initial target. How about we try $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However,  $9,500 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one more move to close this deal. How about $10,250? This is a very fair offer, considering the value this product brings.",10250.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make a concession, Alice. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,250 and my initial offer of $9,000. How about we try $9,625?",9625.0,Bob,6,
