"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $650,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While I understand the value of the product, I need to stay within a certain budget. Would you consider $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your budget constraints, the  $725,000 offer is still too low for a product of this caliber. I can go down to $890,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work.",890000.0,Alice,5,
