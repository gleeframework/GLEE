Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counter-offer. However,  $650,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential benefits for you. I'm willing to come down to $975,000. I believe this price represents a fair deal for both of us.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here. While I appreciate your budget constraints, the  $725,000 offer is still too low for a product of this caliber. I can go down to $890,000. This is my final offer, as it's a significant reduction and reflects my desire to make this deal work. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is playing hardball and has declared this her ""final offer.""  While she might be bluffing, the price of $890,000 is too close to your maximum budget. It's not worth the risk of further negotiation. You can get the product for a guaranteed $800,000 from John, saving you $90,000."
