"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product, your asking price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  I could consider a price closer to $800,000.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  However, $800,000 undervalues the product significantly.  To be fair, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. This reflects a considerable compromise on my end while acknowledging the value you'd gain.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're making compromises, but $1,900,000 is still beyond my budget.  I can offer $950,000; I believe this is a fair price considering John's offer.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but bringing John into this isn't productive. Our negotiations should focus on the value *you* place on the product.  I'm willing to move down to $1,700,000, but that's my best offer.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I respect your position, but I also have a budget to consider.  Let's find a middle ground. Would you consider $1,100,000 for the product?",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, we need to be realistic. While I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us, I have other options to consider. My final offer is $1,450,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I need a decision from you on this.",1450000.0,Alice,7,
