{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than the $15,000 maximum I'm willing to pay.  It's worth exploring if I can get an even better price by counter-offering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm increasing my counteroffer again, but this time by a smaller margin. I'm trying to signal to Alice that I'm getting closer to accepting a price but still believe I can get a better deal.  I'm hoping this gradual increase will make her more receptive to finding a middle ground."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is slightly better than her previous offer, it's still above my ideal range. With limited rounds remaining, it's a gamble, but I'm still hoping to negotiate a lower price. There's always a chance that Alice might get closer to my target price in the remaining rounds."

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my counteroffer once again, but this time to a point very close to Alice's previous offer. With only a few rounds left, I'm trying to show Alice that I'm serious about buying the product but still believe there's room for a compromise.  I'm hoping this will encourage her to accept my offer or make a final counteroffer close to my target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round, and while I'd ideally like to negotiate a lower price, I'm running out of time. Accepting Alice's offer at $9,000 is still a significantly better deal than buying from John for $15,000. It's time to secure the product and avoid missing out on a good deal."
