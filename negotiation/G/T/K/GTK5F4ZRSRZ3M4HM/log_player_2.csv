Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe we can close the deal."", ""product_price"": 9000}

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. In light of this, I am willing to consider a price of $9,300 for the product. I believe this offers a fair compromise between our interests. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,300. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,300
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,300 is within your budget and represents a good compromise.  It's closer to your desired price point than John's offer.  There's no guarantee you'll get a better offer in future rounds, so accepting this deal seems like the best option."
