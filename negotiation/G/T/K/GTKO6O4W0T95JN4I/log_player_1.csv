Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000

Bob is still offering the minimum I'm willing to accept, and I've already gone down from my initial offer.  I'm not sure I'll be able to get a better price with him.  Selling to John is the safest option to ensure I get my minimum price."
