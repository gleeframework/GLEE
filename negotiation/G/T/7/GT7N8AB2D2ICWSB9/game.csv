"I appreciate your time, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I have to be mindful of my budget. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $12,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be able to make a profit. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $14,000? I think that's a fair price for both of us, and I'm really interested in getting this product.",14000.0,Bob,4,
