Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value, I'm asking for $18,000. I'm confident you'll find this to be a fair offer."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","While Bob's offer matches John's, I'm not ready to settle just yet. There's still room for negotiation.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $12,000 is a tempting offer, I know the true value of this product goes beyond that. How about we meet halfway at $15,000?"", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $15,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $13,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, accepting this offer guarantees a profit above John's offer and avoids the risk of further negotiation."
