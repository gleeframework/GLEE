Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, and I'm offering it to you first before considering other buyers. Given its potential, I'm suggesting a price of $1,500,000."", 
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:** You know Bob values the product at $1,000,000, and you have a guaranteed sale at that price to John. This means you have significant leverage to negotiate a higher price with Bob.
* **Anchoring:** By starting with a significantly higher offer ($1,500,000), you set a high anchor point for the negotiation. This might make Bob more receptive to a slightly lower price than if you started at, say, $1,200,000.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's value (""incredibly valuable,"" ""its potential"") without being overly aggressive. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** This strategy assumes Bob is somewhat open to negotiation. If you know Bob to be extremely price-sensitive or likely to walk away from a high initial offer, you might adjust your strategy.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  There's a chance Bob rejects the offer, and you'll get your guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  However, aiming high gives you the potential to maximize your profit."
