"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your target price of $1,000,000.  You should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,175,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,175,000 is still above your target price of $1,000,000. While it is a compromise, you can likely still negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows you to continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This price is still a good profit for you and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit more reasonable for you, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,125,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,125,000 is very close to your target price of $1,000,000. While you could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice backing out or you needing to buy from John for a significantly higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product for a price that is still significantly less than John's offer."
