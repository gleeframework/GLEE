"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, I'm looking to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000 just yet. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1,175,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1175000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,175,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000. This price is still a good profit for you and closer to my budget. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is a bit more reasonable for you, but I'm still not willing to give up too much profit. I'm willing to meet you at $1,125,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. What do you think?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
