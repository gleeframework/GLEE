Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's potential,  $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000, which is still a good deal for you and leaves some room for negotiation.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
