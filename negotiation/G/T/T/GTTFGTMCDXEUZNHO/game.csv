"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we compromise at $10,500? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise again, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've already gone as low as I can, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm going to have to pass on this deal if we can't meet at a lower price. Can you reconsider and meet me at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $9,000. It's below my minimum price, and I'm not comfortable with that. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make a bit more profit. How about we meet at $9,800? It's a fair price that should work for both of us.",9800.0,Alice,9,
