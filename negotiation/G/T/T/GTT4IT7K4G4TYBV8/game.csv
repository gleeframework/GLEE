"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I have to consider my own needs. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make at least $11000 to make this deal worthwhile. How about we compromise at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $10500 is still a bit above what I can comfortably spend.  I'm happy to go to $10000, which would be a fair deal for both of us. What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in this product, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you at $10200, which is a bit higher than your last offer, but I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",10200.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to make a profit, but $10200 is still a bit too much for me. I'm really determined to get this product, but I can't go above $10000. Let's finalize this deal at my offer â€“ it's a win-win for both of us.  What do you say?",10000.0,Bob,6,

"I can see you're really serious about this, Bob, and I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I'm not willing to go all the way to $10000. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to meet you at $10150. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can wrap up the deal here.",10150.0,Alice,7,
