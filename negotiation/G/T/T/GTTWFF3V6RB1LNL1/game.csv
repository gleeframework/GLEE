"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $150 to me, but I understand its value might be different for you. To start, I'm willing to offer it to you for $140. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at a reasonable price.",140.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm interested in the product, $140 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $125 for it.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. Considering our previous discussion, I am willing to adjust my offer slightly. I propose we meet in the middle and agree on a price of $137.50 for the product. This allows us to both feel satisfied with the transaction.",137.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $137.50 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm happy to meet you halfway on my previous offer and offer $130 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",130.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob. In an effort to reach an agreement, I'm willing to offer the product at $132.50. This price reflects a compromise that respects both our interests. I hope this proposal works for you.",132.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me. I'm still a bit above my budget at $132.50.  I'm willing to go up to $130,  which is a fair compromise.  Let's close this deal.",130.0,Bob,6,
