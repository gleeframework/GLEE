"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000.  It's a great deal for you, as you know it's worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a better solution for both of us. How about we aim for a price closer to the value I see in the product? Would $800,000 be acceptable to you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, it's important to remember that the product is worth at least $800,000 to me. By rejecting this offer, I can potentially secure a better price in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $800,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $850,000 to facilitate a quick sale. This still leaves room for you to profit handsomely.  Let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think we can find a fair price for both of us. Considering the value I place on the product, how about we aim for $750,000? I believe this would be a win-win situation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
``` 
 
While I'm still hoping for a better deal with Bob, this round's offer is getting too low for me. It's a risky move, but I'm going to sell to John for $800,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and I'm within my minimum target price.  There's always a chance I could have negotiated further with Bob, but it's not worth the risk at this point."
