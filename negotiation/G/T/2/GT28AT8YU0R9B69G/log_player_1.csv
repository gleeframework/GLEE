"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $150.  This is a good starting point as it's higher than the product's value to Bob, but not unreasonably high. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product."

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $120, which is its value to me. I will reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm going to counter with $130. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair offer."
