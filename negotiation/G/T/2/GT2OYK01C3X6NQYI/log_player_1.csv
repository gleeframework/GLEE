"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm initially offering it at $2,000,000."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always beneficial to start negotiations higher than your desired selling point. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the ""unique value proposition,"" subtly justifying the high price without revealing your bottom line.
* **Future Rounds:** This initial offer gives you leverage in subsequent rounds. You can choose to come down gradually, making Bob feel like he's getting a better deal. It also allows you to better assess Bob's true valuation based on his counteroffer."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,400,000 is a significant amount, it's still below your minimum acceptable price. Bob's counteroffer indicates he's seriously interested and willing to negotiate within a reasonable range. You have room to negotiate further and aim for a better deal."

}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** You've made a significant concession of $200,000, demonstrating willingness to negotiate while still staying above your minimum.
