"Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique opportunity to acquire a product that I believe holds significant value. My asking price is $1800000. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows for a maximum of $500000. I hope we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $500000 is significantly lower than my initial asking price, I'm willing to consider a compromise.  I'm prepared to drop my price to $1500000. This still reflects the value of the product, but it leaves room for us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort. Given my budget, I would like to propose a price of $700000. I believe this strikes a balance between our interests. Looking forward to your response.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer. However, $700000 is still significantly below the product's true value. I'm prepared to lower my price to $1300000, a figure that acknowledges your budget constraints while still reflecting the product's worth. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial solution. What are your thoughts?",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with a price of $900000. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise between the value of the product and my budget constraints. I look forward to your consideration.",900000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate. While $900000 is a step in the right direction, it still falls short of the true value of the product. I'm prepared to meet you halfway at $1050000. This price reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your budgetary limitations. I believe this is a fair offer that allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's close this deal.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for your persistence in finding a middle ground. I appreciate your efforts. I am willing to consider $1000000 as a fair price for the product, given its value and my budget constraints. I hope this proposal will lead to a satisfactory conclusion.",1000000.0,Bob,8,
