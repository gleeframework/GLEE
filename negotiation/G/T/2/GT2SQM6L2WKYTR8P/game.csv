"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, which is still a good profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,250,000 is simply too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1,325,000. This offer still provides you with a significant value and allows me to achieve a fair price. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,325,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget constraints. Let's come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
