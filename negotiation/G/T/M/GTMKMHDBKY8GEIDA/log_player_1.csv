Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly above my budget. Given my research, I believe a fair price for this product would be $800,000. I'm open to negotiating a bit higher, but I'm not willing to go over $850,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your desire for a higher return, but $1,025,000 is still too much for me.  Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my initial offer. I believe this price reflects the value of the product while staying within a reasonable range for both of us. What do you think?
