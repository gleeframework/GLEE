You should reject Alice's offer. It's higher than your maximum budget.  You should counteroffer and see if you can get a better price."

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $1,000,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still within a reasonable range. I hope to get a better price than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation."

While Alice's offer is closer to my maximum budget, it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with.  I'll reject and try to get a better deal with another counteroffer."

I'm going to counter with $1,250,000. This is halfway between Alice's latest offer and my maximum budget. It demonstrates my willingness to compromise while still trying to save some money."

Alice's offer is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer. However, I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I'm not sure how much further Alice will budge.  To save time and avoid potential risk, I'll buy the product from John at $1,200,000."
