"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $13,000, which is still more than Bob's maximum budget of $15,000.
* **Strategy:** Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price.  He has 9 more rounds to make a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer strategy:**  Bob starts with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his ideal price while leaving room for negotiation. This shows Alice he's serious but also willing to compromise. 
* **Amount:** $11,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a counteroffer without losing too much."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more to $12,000. This is a great deal for both of us, and I believe you'll find this product to be worth every penny.  Let's make this happen!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:**  Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's offer:** $12,000, which is still above Bob's ideal price but closer than before. 
* **Strategy:** Bob still has 7 rounds to negotiate and can potentially get a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $11,500.  This is my best offer.  Let's see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Counteroffer strategy:** Bob is gradually increasing his offer, showing Alice he's serious about the deal. This also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Amount:** $11,500 is a reasonable compromise between Bob's previous offer and Alice's current offer, potentially making the deal more attractive to Alice."
