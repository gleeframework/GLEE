{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$13,000:** This price is a good starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still ensuring a profit for me. It's also a reasonable offer for Bob, considering the product is worth $15,000 to him.
* **Message:** This message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product to Bob, making him more likely to accept the offer. It also encourages further discussion and negotiation.

I'm starting with a higher price to maximize my potential earnings. I'm ready to negotiate, but I also have John as a backup buyer, ensuring I'll get at least $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm not willing to sell for such a low price.  I know the product is worth at least $10,000 to me, and John is willing to pay that.  I'm going to counter with a higher price, closer to my initial offer, to see if I can secure a better deal.  I have a backup option with John, so I don't have to settle for a price that's too low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still allows me to make a profit while giving you a great price on a valuable product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$11,000:** This counteroffer is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. It's a reasonable price that still allows me to make a profit and potentially find a middle ground with Bob.
* **Message:** This message reiterates my position and highlights the value of the product for Bob while remaining open to further discussion. I aim to show flexibility and a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit hesitant. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's counteroffer of $9,500 is still too low for me.  While it's closer to my initial asking price, I'm not comfortable going lower than $10,000.  I value the product at that price, and John is willing to pay it.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $10,000.  It's a guaranteed sale and ensures that I make a decent profit.  It's not the highest price I could have hoped for, but it's the most sensible decision given the current situation."
