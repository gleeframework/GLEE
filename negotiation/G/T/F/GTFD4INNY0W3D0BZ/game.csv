"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I believe it's a great fit for you and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm very interested in the product, though. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  That's a good price for both of us and gets the deal done quickly.",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but I'm not quite ready to accept $1,100,000. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for this product. How about we meet at $1,150,000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets me closer to my target.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
