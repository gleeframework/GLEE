"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum but still within a range Bob might be willing to consider, given he values the product at $80. 
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I've left room to come down in price if necessary. 
* **Early Bird:** I'm aiming to close the deal quickly, as I have the option to sell to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $180 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity to negotiate:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I still have room to negotiate with Bob and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Testing the waters:** Rejecting Bob's offer shows him I'm serious about my asking price and allows me to gauge his willingness to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  I appreciate your interest.  While $120 is a bit lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $160. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 160}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm demonstrating flexibility by lowering my price, but still staying above my minimum. 
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly tone shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Reasonable Counter:** $160 is a fair compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.  
* **Encouraging Acceptance:** My message encourages Bob to accept the counteroffer, emphasizing that it's a good deal for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $160, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $140 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to minimum:** While $140 is close to my minimum acceptable price of $150, it's still below it.
* **Potential for better deal:**  I'm still within the negotiation window, and Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer.
* **Maintaining leverage:** Rejecting his offer keeps the pressure on him and demonstrates my firm stance. 
* **John's offer:**  Although I could sell to John for $150, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob,  $140 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. How about we split the difference and settle on $145?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll enjoy the product."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** This tactic is often seen as a fair compromise, showing willingness to meet halfway.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to see it as worth the price.
* **Close to My Minimum:** $145 is very close to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still above it, so it's a win for me.
* **Building Momentum:**  I'm trying to close the deal in this round as we're getting close to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're already in round 6, and I only have 10 rounds to close the deal. 
* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** $130 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  It's unlikely I can get him to go higher in the remaining rounds.
* **Guaranteed Profit with John:** Selling to John guarantees me a profit of $150, which is my minimum and worth the risk of losing a potential negotiation with Bob. 
* **Avoiding Further Negotiation:** It's not worth risking more time and potentially getting stuck with a lower price with Bob."
