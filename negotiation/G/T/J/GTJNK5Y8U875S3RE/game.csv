"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the negotiation. While your product is good, I think $1,200,000 is a bit high. I'd be willing to pay $800,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still finding it difficult to justify a price that high.  Would you be willing to consider $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, $900,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope you can meet me there.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
