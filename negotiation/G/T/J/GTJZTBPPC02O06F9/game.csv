"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this valuable product.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for discussions.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  Could we consider a compromise around $950,000? This reflects the product's potential while acknowledging your interest.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $950,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000?",825000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $825,000 is closer to the mark, I need to be realistic about the value of this product. Would you be willing to consider $875,000? This represents a significant compromise on my end.",875000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer!  I'm willing to stretch my budget a bit further. How about $850,000 and we have a deal?",850000.0,Bob,6,
