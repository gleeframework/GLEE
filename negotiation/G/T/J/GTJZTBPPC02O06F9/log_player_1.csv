Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $700,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price.  However, $700,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer at $850,000 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than his initial offer and a reasonable compromise. Holding out for more risks Bob walking away, and while John offers the full value, securing a deal now is preferable."
