"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $6,000 is a very good price, but it's always worth seeing if you can get it even lower.  You have plenty of rounds left to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000} 
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a bold move, but it shows I'm serious about getting a good deal. If she rejects this, I can adjust my counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  $5,500 is still a good price, but I'm confident I can get it down further. I have plenty of rounds left to negotiate and I don't want to rush into a deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has come down a bit, so I'm going to raise my offer slightly. I want to show I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price significantly lower than her initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice is getting closer to my desired price. I've already rejected her offer twice, and while I could keep trying to get a lower price, it's getting risky. I have only 5 rounds left, and if I keep rejecting offers, I might end up buying from John at a much higher price.  $5,250 is a decent price, and I'm comfortable closing the deal."
