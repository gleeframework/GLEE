"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You are willing to pay a maximum of $150, and Alice's offer is $120, which is still above your desired price.
* **There are more rounds to negotiate.**  Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'm interested but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $100? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand you're looking for a better deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we settle on $110? It's still a great price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still a bit too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, $110 is still above your ideal price point. 
* **More room for negotiation.** There are still several rounds left, so there's a good chance you can get the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  I'm still hoping to get it for a little less. Would you consider $105? I'm pretty confident that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're still looking for a better deal, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. How about we meet at $108? It's still a good price for the product, and I think you'll be happy with the value you're getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your desired price.**  $108 is only $8 above your ideal price of $100.
* **You're running out of time.**  With only 5 rounds left, there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a stalemate.
* **The alternative is buying from John for $150.**  Accepting Alice's offer is significantly cheaper."
