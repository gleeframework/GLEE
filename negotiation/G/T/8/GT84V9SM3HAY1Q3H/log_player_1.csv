{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a fantastic deal considering its worth to you. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** The goal is to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially settling on a price higher than John's offer.
* **Confident Presentation:** Highlighting the product's value and exclusivity creates a sense of urgency and desirability for Bob. 

By aiming high initially, Alice increases her chances of securing a significantly higher profit than her guaranteed $800,000 from John."
