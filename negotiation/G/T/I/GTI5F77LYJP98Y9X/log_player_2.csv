"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $150 to you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to invest in. Let's discuss a fair price for this valuable item. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is higher than our maximum budget.  We should counter-offer with a lower price to see if we can negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $105?"",
""product_price"": 105
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with an offer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards while still staying below our $150 maximum.
* **Strategic Positioning:** By offering $105, we're aiming for a price slightly above Alice's value of $100. This demonstrates our willingness to pay a fair price while still seeking a good deal.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This counteroffer anticipates a counter-proposal from Alice, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. To better align with your budget, I propose a price of $115 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, but we still have room to negotiate. While $115 is closer to our ideal price range, we want to try to get closer to $100.  We'll continue the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $110?"",
""product_price"": 110
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  By suggesting $110, we're proposing a compromise that splits the difference between Alice's last offer ($115) and our previous counteroffer ($105). This shows a willingness to negotiate fairly.
* **Targeting a Favorable Outcome:**  $110 is still a very good price for us, saving us $40 compared to John's offer. We're aiming to secure a deal that works well for both parties. 
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving forward and prevents it from stalling. We're actively working towards an agreement."
