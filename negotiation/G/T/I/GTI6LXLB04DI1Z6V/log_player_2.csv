"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it's worth every penny, and I'm willing to part with it for a price that I think is fair. I'm offering it to you for $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is offering the product at her own valuation, leaving no room for you to save money. While her message emphasizes the product's value, it doesn't offer any incentive for you to choose her over John, who is selling at the same price.  You should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or be prepared to buy from John."
