"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great opportunity to purchase a high-value product. I'm confident you'll love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $14,000 is better than John's price of $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money.  While Alice has come down a bit, $14,500 is still above Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to get a lower price."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming to get the best deal possible, and $14,500 is a little high for me.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice has come down slightly, $14,750 is still more than Bob is comfortable paying.  At this point, Bob has gone back and forth with Alice a few times and is starting to feel like he's getting close to his limit.  Rather than risk further negotiation and potentially ending up paying even more, Bob decides to go with John's offer of $15,000.  This ensures he gets the product and doesn't have to risk pushing Alice further."
