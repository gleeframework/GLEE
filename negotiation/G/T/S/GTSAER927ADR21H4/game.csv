"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  While I'm interested, $14,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",13000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming to get the best deal possible, and $14,500 is a little high for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $14,000?  I'm confident we can reach an agreement that works for both of us.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $14,750. It's still a great deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",14750.0,Alice,5,
