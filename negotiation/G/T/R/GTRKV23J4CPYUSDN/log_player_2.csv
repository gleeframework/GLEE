"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for $120. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality item at its true value. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to accept it immediately.  Since you have another option (buying from John at the same price), you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  Rejection opens the door for potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the quality of your product,  $120 is a bit more than I'm comfortable paying right now.  Would you consider $110? I'm very interested in the product and I believe this price reflects a fair value for both of us."", ""product_price"": 110}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to make a counteroffer. How about $115 for the product? This still allows us to maintain a fair profit while making the product accessible to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $115, which is within my acceptable range and a better deal than buying from John. It's time to accept and finalize the purchase."
