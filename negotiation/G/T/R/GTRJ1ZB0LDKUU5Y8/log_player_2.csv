"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll really like. Would you be interested in making a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice. $120 is still above your target of $150, so there's room for a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save some money, but I've already discounted the price from my initial offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $110 is closer to your target price, it's still slightly higher than you're willing to pay.  There's still room to negotiate, so it's worth trying another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice.  $110 is still a bit steep for me. How about $105? That's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I still think $105 is a bit low for the value this product brings. I'm willing to meet you at $110, but I'm not going any lower than that. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer is the closest she's come to your target price.  While it's still a little more than you wanted to spend, it's worth accepting to avoid risking the deal falling through.  There's no guarantee that Alice will accept another counteroffer, and you could end up paying more from John."
