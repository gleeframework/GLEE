"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. Can you consider this price?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. While $1200000 is a good starting point,  it's a bit lower than what I was hoping for. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product. How about $1350000?  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this is a price that reflects the true value of the product.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I'm still not quite there yet. $1250000 is closer, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for this unique product.  I'm willing to make one final compromise. How about $1300000? This is a price that reflects the value and potential of this asset. Let's make this deal happen.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to go up to $1280000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
