Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a bit higher than what you'd get from John, but it still leaves some room for Bob to gain value from the purchase (as it's lower than his perceived value of $12,000). This strategy maximizes your chances of getting a better price while still having a backup option with John."
