"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is a good price, there's a chance he can get it for even less. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to explore the possibility of a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a lower counteroffer, aiming to get a lower price.  He's using a significant discount from Alice's initial price to signal his intent to negotiate seriously. This approach might encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,500 is closer to Bob's target price, he's still determined to get a better deal. He's only used two rounds of negotiation and still has eight more rounds. There's a chance he could secure a lower price by continuing the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now making a slightly more aggressive counteroffer, raising his price by $1,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise, but he's still pushing for a price closer to his desired target. He's gauging Alice's willingness to meet him halfway."
