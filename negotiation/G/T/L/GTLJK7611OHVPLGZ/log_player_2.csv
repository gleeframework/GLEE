"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $13,500. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,500 is lower than John's price of $15,000, there's room for negotiation. Alice values the product at $12,000, meaning she might be willing to go lower. By rejecting this initial offer, Bob might be able to secure a better deal from Alice."
