Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product today for $12,000.  I know it's valuable to you and I think this is a fair price that reflects that. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since the product is worth $8,000 to both you and Bob, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation and potential profit maximization. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the high price (even if it's just perceived value) can make Bob more receptive. 
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone implies willingness to negotiate, which is crucial in a single-offer scenario.  

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a lower offer to appear more reasonable, but that might leave money on the table. This initial offer aims high to gauge Bob's interest and flexibility."
