Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I believe it provides significant value, and this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Avoid Alienating Bob:**  Offering it too close to $15,000 might make Bob feel tricked or pressured, potentially leading to a rejection.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring the deal goes through."
