Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $15,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more confident in the product's value.
* **Justification:**  While not explicitly stating the product's worth to you, the message hints at its value by mentioning offering it to Bob before a public listing.  
* **Gauging Interest:**  This offer allows you to gauge Bob's interest level. If he outright rejects it, you can always negotiate down or move on to John. 

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is particularly price-sensitive, you might slightly lower your initial offer.
* **Relationship:**  If you value a long-term relationship with Bob, you might be willing to accept a smaller profit margin."
