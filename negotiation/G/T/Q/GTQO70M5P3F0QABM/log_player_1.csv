Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Target price:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum price ($15,000) as possible.
* **Starting point:**  I'm offering $14,000, which is slightly lower than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **John's offer:**  I can always go to John if Bob rejects my offer, so I don't need to give away the product for less than $14,000 right away. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing the offer as a ""great deal"" for Bob to encourage him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $13,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value to me:**  $13,000 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  Bob is clearly interested and has demonstrated a willingness to negotiate.
* **John's offer:**  I'm not desperate to sell, and John's offer provides a safety net if this negotiation doesn't work out.

**Next steps:**  I will counteroffer Bob to try to close the gap, but I'll remain firm about my minimum price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working with a budget. I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This is a significant concession on my part, but I truly believe this product is worth it to you. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by offering a price that's midway between our last two offers.
* **Focus on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the value the product offers, hoping to sway his decision.
* **Maintain leverage:** I'm not giving away the product for my minimum price yet. I still have John's offer as a backup.
* **Positive framing:** I'm framing my counteroffer as a ""significant concession"" to make it seem more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $13,250. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $13,250 is still below my minimum price of $15,000.
* **Small gap:**  The gap between our offers is now only $750, which is a relatively small amount.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, so there's no urgency to sell to Bob at this price.
* **Testing boundaries:**  By rejecting this offer, I can push Bob further to see if he's willing to go higher.

**Next steps:** I'll make a counteroffer closer to my desired price, hoping to secure a deal closer to $14,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Let's try $13,400. It's a small step up from your offer, but I believe it's fair considering the value of the product for you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13400}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my desired price:** I'm proposing $13,400, which is closer to my ideal price point of $14,000 while still acknowledging Bob's budget constraints.
* **Small increment:** The $150 increase from Bob's offer is small enough to make it seem like a reasonable compromise.
* **Emphasis on value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him to encourage him to accept.
* **Maintaining leverage:** I'm not giving in to his last offer, showing that I'm still willing to negotiate but won't settle for a price that undervalues the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to my budget, but I'm still a bit short. I'm willing to go up to $13,200. Can we meet at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below my minimum:**  $13,200 is still below my minimum price of $15,000. 
* **Stalemate:** We've been going back and forth for a few rounds, and there's no guarantee that Bob will budge any further.
* **John's offer:**  I have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, which is significantly higher than Bob's current offer.

**Conclusion:**  It's time to cut my losses and go with the sure thing. I'll sell the product to John for $15,000. While I would have preferred to get closer to $14,000, it's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob."
