"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $18000 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $14000? That's still a good deal for you, and it gives me a fair price for the product.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your need for a fair price, but $14000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm happy to go up to $12000, which I believe is a fair compromise.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,4,
