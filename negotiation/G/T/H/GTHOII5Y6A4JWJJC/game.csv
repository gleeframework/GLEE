"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think you'll love it, and I'm willing to let it go for a price of $800,000. It's a steal, if I do say so myself!",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $800,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $700,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $750,000. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",750000.0,Alice,3,
