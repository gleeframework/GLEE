"Thank you for offering the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I am looking to stay within a budget of $10000 for this purchase. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $10000?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $12500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $12500 is still slightly above my preferred budget, I'm willing to consider it. However, I would like to propose an alternative. Could we perhaps agree on a price of $11000? This would allow me to stay within my budget while still acquiring the product.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your proposal, Bob. I understand that $11000 is still a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer the product to you for $12200. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal considering the value of the product.",12200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Considering the value of the product and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a final offer of $11500. I believe this strikes a good balance between our positions and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",11500.0,Bob,6,
