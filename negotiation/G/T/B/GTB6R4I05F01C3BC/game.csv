"Alice, your product is certainly interesting, but $1,300,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While the product is worth a premium, let's meet closer to the middle. I'm proposing $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still interested, but $1,200,000 is still a bit too much for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?  I think this is a fair price for both of us.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to come down a bit more. How about $1,150,000? This is my final offer.",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,100,000, but I can go up to $1,125,000.  Let's make a deal.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
