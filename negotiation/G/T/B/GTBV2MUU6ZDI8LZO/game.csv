"Hello Bob, it's a pleasure to connect with you. I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant return on investment it offers.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,000,000 is far more than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm interested in this product, but I believe a price of $1,250,000 is more reasonable, given my budget and the market value.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,250,000 undervalues the unique advantages this product offers. I'm confident it can significantly impact your business, and I wouldn't want you to miss out on this opportunity. To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This feels like a fair reflection of its value and potential.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm confident this product is valuable, but I believe a price of $1,400,000 would be a fair compromise.  This allows for a reasonable profit for you while staying within my financial constraints.  Let's work towards a deal that benefits both of us.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
