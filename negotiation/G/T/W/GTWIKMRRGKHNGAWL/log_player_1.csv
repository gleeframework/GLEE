"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think would be of great interest to you. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, but I'm willing to start the negotiation with a price of $11,500.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value to you, but my budget is quite tight. I am willing to offer $9,800 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a higher price.  I'm not willing to sell to John yet, as I think I can get closer to my target with Bob. I'll try to counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to accept that price.  It's a bit below my minimum.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650? This is still a good deal for you, considering you value it at $12,000, and it gives me a bit more flexibility."", ""product_price"": 10650}
