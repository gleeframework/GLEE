Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 110}
```

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. I know Bob values the product at $80, so I'm leaving some room for negotiation, but I want to see if he's willing to pay more than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. $90 is better than nothing, but I can still do better. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $100 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
```

I'm going to offer $95 to Bob. It's a compromise between my initial offer and his counteroffer, and it's still a good price for me.  I'm hoping he'll see that it's a fair deal and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob is clearly not willing to pay anything close to what the product is worth to me. It's better to take the guaranteed $100 from John than risk another round with Bob and potentially end up with even less."
