"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to get the product for a bit less. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. This is still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a better deal. I have 9 more rounds to work with."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to be closer to $1,400,000 to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,350,000? Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1350000}
