Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I think we're getting very close to the minimum price I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you at $1,010,000, but I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Diminishing Returns:**  We've gotten Alice down to $1,010,000.  It's unlikely she'll go much lower, and further haggling might irritate her.
* **Time Investment:**  We've spent 7 rounds already. The longer this goes on, the more likely Alice is to stick to a higher price. 
* **Savings:**  $1,010,000 is a significant savings compared to John's offer of $1,200,000. 

While we could try to squeeze out a few thousand more, the risk of losing the deal and having to settle for John's offer isn't worth it at this point."
