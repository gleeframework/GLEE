"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  It's something that I know you've been looking for, and I'm confident it would be a great asset to your business. I'm offering it to you at a price of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering its value to both of us. If you're interested, let's discuss the details further. However, if you decline, I have another buyer ready to purchase it at $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice is trying to inflate the price and create a sense of urgency, even though her fallback offer is the same as John's. You can get the product for $800,000 from John without the pressure tactic."
