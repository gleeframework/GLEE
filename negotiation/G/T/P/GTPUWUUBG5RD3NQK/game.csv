,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm really interested in the product, but $200 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now.  Would you be willing to accept $125? ",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that 200 might be a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as 125. How about we meet in the middle at 175? I'm willing to compromise to find a price that works for both of us.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being willing to compromise.  However, $175 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  Let's try $140.  I think this is a fair price considering what the product is worth to me, and I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that 140 is still a bit below your target price, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between 140 and 175, which would be 157.50. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",157.5,Alice,5,
