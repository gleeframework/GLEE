Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,150,000 creates a win-win scenario if Bob accepts:
    * **Bob Saves:** He gets the product for $50,000 less than its value to him ($1,000,000).
    * **You Profit:** You earn $150,000 more than selling to John.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly. 

**Important Note:**  There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price. Your next move would depend on his response and your willingness to negotiate."
