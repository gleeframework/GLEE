You are looking to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the gesture. However, I'm looking to pay a bit less. Would you be willing to accept $12,500 for the product?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with $12,500. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's a fair price for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $13,500 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, you can still potentially get a better deal. Rejecting allows you to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to your target of $12,500."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference -  I'm willing to pay $13,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're looking for a fair price, Bob. However, I've already compromised a lot by offering $13,500, and $13,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I can offer it to you for $13,750. This is as low as I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's latest offer is $13,750. This is still below your maximum price of $15,000 and closer to your desired price of $12,500. It's a good deal for you, and continuing to negotiate may not yield a significantly better price, especially with limited rounds left. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without risking the deal falling through."
