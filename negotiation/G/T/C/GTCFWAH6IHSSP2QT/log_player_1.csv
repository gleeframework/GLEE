Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $150. I think it's a great deal and worth considering."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Starting with a higher offer allows you to potentially maximize your profit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Even if Bob finds $150 a bit steep, it opens the door for negotiation. He might counter-offer, and you can potentially settle on a price higher than $100.
* **John as a Backup:** Knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $100 with John gives you leverage in negotiations with Bob. You're not desperate to sell below your minimum."
