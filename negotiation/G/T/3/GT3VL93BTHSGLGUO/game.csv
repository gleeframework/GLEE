"Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",875000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to see a more substantial move to make this work. How about $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. It's the best price I can offer, and it's also my bottom line. Let's finalize this deal.",800000.0,Alice,5,
