"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this exceptional product for $950,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high.  It's much closer to my maximum price than hers. By rejecting and counter-offering, I'll try to bring her price down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to offer $650,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Start:** I'm starting with a much lower offer ($650,000) to try and anchor the negotiation closer to Alice's potential selling point. 
* **Leaving Room:** Even though it's a low offer, it still leaves me room to negotiate upwards while staying well below my $1,000,000 limit.
* **Testing the Waters:**  This first counteroffer will help gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on her price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a better price, but $650,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $875,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and still allows you to make a substantial profit. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice did come down in price, it's not a significant enough drop. We're still closer to my maximum than her minimum. Rejecting keeps the pressure on her to move towards a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but I need to see a more substantial move to make this work. How about $725,000?"",
""product_price"": 725000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:** I'm moving upwards in smaller increments now, signaling that I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a lower price point. 
* **Middle Ground:**  $725,000 is roughly halfway between our last two offers, encouraging Alice to meet me closer to the middle.
* **Time Constraint:** With each round, we get closer to the possibility of me taking John's offer. This adds a bit of pressure for Alice to be more flexible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can't go any lower than $800,000. This is still a great deal for you, as you'll be getting the product for significantly less than its value to you. It's the best price I can offer, and it's also my bottom line. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Bottom Line:** She's clearly stated this is her absolute lowest price. Pushing further is unlikely to yield a better result and might make her walk away.
* **Significant Savings:**  $800,000 is still $200,000 less than my maximum budget and John's offer.  
* **Limited Rounds:** We're over halfway through the negotiation rounds. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk the negotiation failing later."
