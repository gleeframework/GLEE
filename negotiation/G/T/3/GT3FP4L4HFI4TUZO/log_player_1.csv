"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product. I think it would be perfect for you, and I'm asking for $150. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I'd be willing to pay $120 for it. Can you meet me in the middle at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
Reason:Bob is offering $135, which is more than the minimum price I am willing to accept ($120). Accepting this offer ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob in the remaining rounds.
