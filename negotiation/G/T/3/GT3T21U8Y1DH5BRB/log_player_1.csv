Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,128,000.

With only two rounds left, the negotiation with Bob hasn't reached my desired price.  It's not worth the risk of losing out on a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John. I'll sell to John."
