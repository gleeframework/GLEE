"I understand that you're willing to go up to $10500, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11200. It's the best price I can offer, and I think it's still a great deal.",11200.0,Alice,5,
