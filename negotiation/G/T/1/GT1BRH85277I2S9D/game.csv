"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and it's a good compromise. ",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer $108.50.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal!",108.5,Alice,5,
