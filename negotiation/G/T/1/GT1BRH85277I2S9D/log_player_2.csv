"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is a good deal compared to Alice's initial valuation of $120, it's still above your maximum price point of $100. It's worth attempting to negotiate with Alice further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now. Would you be willing to come down to $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $110? It's still a good deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my target price. Let's see if we can find a middle ground here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my desired price, but $110 is still above my budget. I will try to counteroffer one last time before resorting to buying from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get a fair price, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference - how about $107.50?  This would be a win-win for both of us, and it's a good compromise. "", ""product_price"": 107.5}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, and offer $108.50.  This would be a good price for both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's seal the deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial price, $108.50 is still above my maximum budget of $100. It's not worth continuing to negotiate with Alice at this point.  I'm better off buying the product from John for a guaranteed price of $100."
