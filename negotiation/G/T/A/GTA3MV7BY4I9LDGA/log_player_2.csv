"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,500,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000. It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $1,250,000. I think this is a fair price considering the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his maximum limit.  Bob should continue negotiating and try to bring the price down further.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is still a better option than accepting Alice's current offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to go up to $1,100,000, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the highest I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the value it will bring to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is firm on her price of $1,200,000. While it is tempting to keep negotiating, it's becoming clear that Alice won't go lower.  It's better to stop the negotiation and buy from John at $1,000,000, which is within Bob's budget and the best deal available at this time."
