"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to start with a price of $18,000. What are your thoughts?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for starting the conversation. That initial price is a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to offer $10,000 for the product.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm thinking of a price of $14,000. This is my best counteroffer for now. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? That's a fair price, and it would allow us both to walk away happy.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $12,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll propose $13,500. This is my final offer for now. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, and I'm willing to move a little bit.  Would you be willing to settle at $12,500? That's the best I can do.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to think we're getting close. I'll meet you at $13,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my last offer, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal.",13000.0,Alice,7,
