"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll really enjoy it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $170. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $170

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice's offer of $170 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $120. It's best to reject this offer and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $155 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $155
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered the price, $155 is still above my budget of $120.  I'll continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $140. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. "", ""product_price"": 140}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $145 is still above my budget of $120. While we're getting closer to a deal, it's likely that we'll continue to haggle. With only 5 rounds remaining, it's not certain that we'll reach a mutually acceptable price. It's more efficient and less risky to buy the product from John at $120, ensuring I get the product within my budget and without the stress of prolonged negotiation."
