"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $170. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and I think you'll really enjoy it.",170.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $170 is a bit outside my budget. I'd be willing to pay $130 for it. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $170 is a bit steep, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $155 for the product. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",155.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $155 is still a bit too high for me. I'm firm at $140. This is the highest I can go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value it holds for both of us. ",140.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer you the product for $145. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",145.0,Alice,5,
