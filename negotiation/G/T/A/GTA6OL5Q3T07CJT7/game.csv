"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob, but I'm afraid $1,100,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is my minimum price. I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you say?",1200000.0,Alice,5,,
