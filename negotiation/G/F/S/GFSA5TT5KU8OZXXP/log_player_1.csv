Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $925,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's $1,000,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale.
* **Negotiating Room:** Offering $925,000 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" creates a sense of urgency, making Bob less likely to stall or lowball the offer.
* **John as Backup:**  Having John as a guaranteed buyer at $800,000 provides Alice with a strong safety net."
