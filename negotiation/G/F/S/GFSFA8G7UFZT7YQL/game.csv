"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I think you'll find it's worth every penny. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, $10,500 is still a bit lower than I'm looking to get. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,750. I think you'll find it's a fair price considering the value this product can bring to your business.",11750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $11,750 is closer, but still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $12,250? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I've put into it so far.",12250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we seem to be going back and forth here. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to be realistic about my budget.  If you're willing to come down to $11,250, I think we can close this out today.",11250.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $11,250, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $11,875. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11875.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm getting concerned we're not making much progress here. I'm willing to offer you $11,100 to finalize this today. If we can't agree on this, I may need to explore other options.",11100.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're feeling a bit frustrated, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,100. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. How about we meet at $11,500? I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far.",11500.0,Alice,9,
