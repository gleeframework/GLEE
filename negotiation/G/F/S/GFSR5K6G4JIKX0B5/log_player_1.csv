Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm setting the price at $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and makes Bob feel like he might get a deal if he counter-offers.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""value,"" Alice subtly implies the product is worth the higher price without explicitly stating Bob would be overpaying. 
* **Alternative Buyer (John):** While John provides a safety net, Alice doesn't need to reveal this information to Bob. Knowing she has a guaranteed buyer gives Alice a stronger position.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer.  Alice should be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters."
