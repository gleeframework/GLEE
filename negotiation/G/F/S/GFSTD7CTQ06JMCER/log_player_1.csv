Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,150,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good profit, and it's the highest I can go at this time. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.
