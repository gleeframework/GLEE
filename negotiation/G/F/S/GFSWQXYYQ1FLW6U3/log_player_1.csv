{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fantastic deal considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer gives me a good starting point, aiming for a profit while still being potentially attractive to Bob. It's also important to remember that John is willing to pay $1,200,000, giving me a safety net if negotiations with Bob fall apart."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can come to a more mutually beneficial agreement. I would like to propose a price of $1300000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is better than John's, but I believe I can still push for a higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to counter with a slightly lower price than my initial offer, hoping to find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective. While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,300,000 doesn't quite reflect the full value of this product for you.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This would give us both a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see your point, Alice. Let me think about it for a moment. I would like to counter with a price of $1325000 for the product. I hope this brings us closer to an agreement that satisfies both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,325,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,325,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,325,000 is closer to my ideal price than my last counteroffer, and it's still significantly more than what John is offering. I'm willing to accept this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure a good profit."
