Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price closer to Bob's maximum willingness to pay. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's ""value,"" I'm subtly anchoring the negotiation around a higher price point. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** My language emphasizes that this is a starting point and I'm willing to negotiate to reach a mutually agreeable price.  

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a collaborative tone."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. Based on my budget and the market value, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. Accepting would mean a substantial loss. I'm better off negotiating further or selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,000 is significantly below the product's true worth.  I'm willing to meet you halfway from our previous offers. How about $16,000?"",
""product_price"": 16000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise (but strategically):** I'm demonstrating flexibility by significantly reducing my price.  However, I'm framing it as meeting ""halfway"" from the initial offer ($22,000) rather than my previous counteroffer ($16,000), anchoring the negotiation around a higher point.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reiterating that the product has inherent value exceeding Bob's initial offer, justifying the higher price.  
* **Seeking Agreement:** The tone remains collaborative, aiming to find common ground and encourage Bob to make a more substantial move. 

This approach balances concession with maintaining a strong negotiating position. I'm leaving myself room to go slightly lower if needed while still aiming for a price that significantly exceeds Bob's initial offer and is closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still feel that $16,000 is out of my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $14,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $14,000 is now very close to my guaranteed sale price with John ($15,000).  While I could potentially squeeze out a bit more from Bob in another round, there's a risk he might walk away. Accepting this offer secures a solid profit and avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation."
