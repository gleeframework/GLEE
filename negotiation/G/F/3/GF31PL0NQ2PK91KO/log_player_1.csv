Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this reflects its worth and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $800,000, you can afford to start high. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Gauging Bob's interest:**  A high initial offer helps you understand how eager Bob is to purchase. His response will guide your next move. 
* **Potential for profit maximization:** If Bob accepts, you've secured a significant profit. If he rejects or negotiates down, you still have John as a safety net."
