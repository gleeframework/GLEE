"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can greatly benefit your business or personal life.

"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for it, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $800000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed. What do you say?",800000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'll make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product.",825000.0,Alice,5,
