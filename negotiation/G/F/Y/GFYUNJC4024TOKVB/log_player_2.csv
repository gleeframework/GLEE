"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product. It's a unique opportunity to own a one-of-a-kind item that can greatly benefit your business or personal life. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the benefits it can bring. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  There's room for negotiation, and you should aim to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it, which I believe is a fair compromise. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but Fair:**  This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's price, showing you're serious about getting a good deal.
* **Leaves Room for Negotiation:**  It's not an insultingly low offer, giving Alice some wiggle room to counter if she wants to continue negotiating. 
* **Towards Your Goal:**  This counteroffer is still within your budget and closer to your goal of saving as much money as possible."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I have to say that I'm not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer it to you for $850000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to your initial counteroffer, but it's still higher than you'd like to pay.  You can likely get it for less. Continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $850,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go to $800,000.  This is a serious offer, and I believe it's fair considering the value we've discussed. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** This counteroffer is a small increase from your previous offer, showing that you're serious about negotiating but still trying to get a good deal. 
* **Focus on Value:**  Mentioning the value discussed in previous rounds reinforces the idea that you're not simply throwing out random numbers.
* **Framing:** Framing it as a ""serious offer"" adds a bit of pressure, potentially pushing Alice closer to accepting."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'll make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Your Goal:**  $825,000 is only $75,000 more than your last offer, which is a significant saving compared to John's price.
* **Limited Rounds:**  You only have 5 rounds left. Continuing to negotiate might not get you a significantly better price, and you risk losing the deal entirely.
* **Alice's Stance:** Alice has shown she's willing to negotiate but has a clear bottom line.  It's likely she won't go lower. 

It's a good time to accept the offer and secure the product at a price you can afford."
