Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I could sell the product to John for $150, there's a chance to earn even more from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $125 is above Bob's perceived value ($100) but might still be enticing. It positions the offer as a ""deal"" while leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Alternative Buyer Safety Net:** If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell to John for my minimum acceptable price. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a sale."
