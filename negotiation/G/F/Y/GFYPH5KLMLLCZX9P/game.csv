"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1000000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1100000. This is a very competitive price, considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1100000. I'm willing to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its potential benefits to my business.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're looking for a more competitive price, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to ensure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is a significant discount from my original price, but it's still a price that reflects the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1025000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its potential benefits to my business.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a sense of where you're coming from, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000, but I need to make sure I'm not leaving too much on the table. I'm going to counteroffer at $1075000. This is a slight increase from my previous offer, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value and potential benefits to your business.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1025000, but I'm still not convinced that $1075000 is the best price for the product. I'm willing to go up a bit, but I'm thinking more along the lines of $1030000. I believe that's a fair price for the product, considering its potential benefits to my business.",1030000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close to a deal, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1030000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. I'm going to counteroffer at $1050000, but I'll throw in a sweetener - I'll include a 5-year warranty and dedicated support for the product. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a great value for the price.",1050000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the added value of the 5-year warranty and dedicated support, but I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1050000. I'm willing to make one final offer of $1025000, and I'm willing to accept the warranty and support as part of the deal. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,10,
