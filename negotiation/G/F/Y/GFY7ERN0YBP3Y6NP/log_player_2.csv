"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $900,000. I think this is a fair price, considering the value it brings to the table. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for a lower price from Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the value it brings to the table, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is still lower than the price Bob would pay from John ($1,200,000).  While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject and the price might increase, or Bob might need to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer is the best option to save money at this point."
