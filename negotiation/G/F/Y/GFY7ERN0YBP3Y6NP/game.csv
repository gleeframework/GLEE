"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. After reconsidering, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the value it brings to the table, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",850000.0,Alice,3,
