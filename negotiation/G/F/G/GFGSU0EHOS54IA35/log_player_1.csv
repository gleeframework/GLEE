Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal, considering its value. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value ($80),** giving you room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable price ($120),**  ensuring you still make a profit.

This strategy allows for potential negotiation while keeping the possibility of selling to John for $120 if Bob isn't interested."
