"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a fantastic opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000.  This is a great deal for you, as it's well below its true value to you.  If you're interested, let me know.  I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset for you.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","I'd like to reject Alice's offer. I can get the product from John for $1,500,000, which is still within my budget of $1,500,000, and I'd be saving $100,000 compared to Alice's offer.
