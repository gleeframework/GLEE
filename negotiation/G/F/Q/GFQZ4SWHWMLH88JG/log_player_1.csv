Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,200,000. This is a price that is higher than Bob's perceived value of $800,000 but still leaves some room for negotiation.

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  My goal is to maximize my profit, and offering a price higher than Bob's value increases the likelihood of getting a good price.
* **Negotiation Leverage:** By starting high, I establish leverage in the negotiation.  Bob is likely to counteroffer, giving me the opportunity to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing that John is willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product gives me a floor price. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can always sell to John. 

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully analyze Bob's response. If he rejects the offer, I'll consider his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $900,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for Higher Price:**  While $900,000 is a good price, I believe I can still get a better deal. Bob is willing to pay more than his perceived value, and I can likely extract a higher price through further negotiation.
* **John's Offer:** John is offering $1,000,000, so selling to Bob for $900,000 would be a loss.  I'm willing to take the risk of a failed negotiation with Bob because John's offer guarantees me a profitable outcome.

**Next Steps:**

I will proceed to the next round and make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm counteroffering Bob with a price of $1,100,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Balancing Risk and Reward:**  I'm lowering my initial price from $1,200,000 but still aiming for a price higher than Bob's counteroffer of $900,000. This balances my desire to maximize profits with the risk of Bob rejecting my counteroffer again.
* **Testing Bob's Limits:** This price allows me to test how much Bob is willing to pay. If he accepts, I'll secure a good deal. If he rejects, I can either make another counteroffer or sell to John.
* **Strategic Compromise:** This counteroffer demonstrates flexibility and willingness to negotiate, which could encourage Bob to make a higher counteroffer himself.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully analyze Bob's response to this counteroffer.  I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary, but I'll keep John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $1,000,000.

**Reasoning:**

* **Guaranteeing Profit:** Bob's counteroffer of $950,000 is getting closer to my desired price, but it's still less than John's offer. 
* **Risk Mitigation:**  Further negotiation with Bob carries the risk that he might reject my next offer. 
* **Time and Effort:**  Negotiating with Bob is taking time and effort, and I'm not convinced that further negotiation will yield a significantly better price. 

John's offer provides a guaranteed profit and allows me to avoid further negotiation."
