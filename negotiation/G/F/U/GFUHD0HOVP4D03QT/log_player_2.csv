"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value to both of us. Given its exceptional quality and benefits, we believe it's worth $10000. Considering its significance to you, I am extending this exclusive offer at the same price, hoping to facilitate a mutually beneficial transaction. Kindly let me know if you are interested in proceeding. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Since the product is worth $10,000 to both Bob and Alice, and Bob has a backup option to buy from John for the same price, there's no incentive for Bob to accept Alice's offer.  He can get the product for the same price from John."
