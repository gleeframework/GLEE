{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to get a good starting point for negotiation. I'll be prepared to adjust my price depending on Bob's reaction."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to keep my expenses within a budget of $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept for the product, and selling to John would yield the same amount. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees a sale and avoids further negotiation."
