Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I've got a fantastic product for you that I think you'll be interested in.  I'm asking for $130 for it, but I'm open to negotiating. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  You're still making a profit above your minimum of $100.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** You've left room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like you're being unreasonable.
* **It shows confidence:**  You're not giving away the product for cheap.

By leaving room for negotiation, you increase the likelihood that you can find a price that works for both of you, and you'll get closer to that $150 value Bob places on the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than the initial offer ($130) and potentially leaves more profit on the table. By rejecting Bob's offer, we can try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, thanks for the counteroffer! I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original price, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $120?  That way we both get a good deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  A $120 price point is a compromise between your previous offer ($130) and Bob's offer ($110). This shows you're willing to negotiate but still value the product.
* **Positive language:**  Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""split the difference"" frames the offer as a win-win scenario for both parties. 
* **Maintains a decent profit:** This offer still allows you to earn more than selling to John for $100."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above that. How about we meet in the middle at $115? That way, I get a good deal and you still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is still lower than our ideal price, it's only $5 away from our last offer and is significantly higher than the $100 we'd get from John.  At this point, the risk of further negotiation potentially leading to a lower price or even a breakdown in negotiations is not worth it. It's better to secure the sale at a price that's still profitable."
