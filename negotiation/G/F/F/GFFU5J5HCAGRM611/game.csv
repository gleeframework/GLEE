"I'm interested in the product, but $140 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to consider $130?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! I'm willing to come down a bit, but $130 is still too low for me. How about $135? That leaves a little room for both of us to be happy.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $132.50?,132.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  $132.50 just doesn't work for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll go down to $134.  That's my final offer. ",134.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $134 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $129?",129.0,Bob,6,
