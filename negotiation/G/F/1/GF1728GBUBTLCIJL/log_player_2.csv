"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for $1,550,000. It's a valuable asset that I believe will be a great addition to your holdings. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested buyer willing to pay the full market value of $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,550,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,550,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is a classic negotiation tactic. She's trying to create a sense of urgency and pressure you into accepting a higher price by mentioning another buyer.  You have a better alternative with John's offer at your maximum price."
