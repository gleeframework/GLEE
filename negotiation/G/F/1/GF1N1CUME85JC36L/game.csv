"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. This is a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",150.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. This is still a great deal, and I'm confident you'll love the product. What do you think?",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $125, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $125 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer it to you for $130. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to walk away if I don't get a better deal. However, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'll pay $120 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go. What do you say?",120.0,Bob,6,
