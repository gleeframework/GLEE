Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It leaves room for negotiation while still significantly exceeding my minimum acceptable price. 

**Reasoning:**

* **High but Realistic:** $1,400,000 is a significant amount, but still leaves some room for Bob to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:** I can always fall back on John's $1,000,000 offer, so I'm not pressured to accept a low price from Bob. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This offer allows me to gauge Bob's interest and understand how motivated he is to buy the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While $1,200,000 is still a significant profit, it's below my ideal price point. 
* **Room for Counter-Negotiation:**  I believe I can likely get a higher price by making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer as a Safety Net:**  I can always go back to John's $1,000,000 offer, but I'm not ready to settle for that yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Towards a Compromise:**  This counteroffer is a compromise, showing my willingness to negotiate while still maintaining a reasonable price. 
* **Bridging the Gap:** The offer is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer, which signals a willingness to meet in the middle. 
* **Still Above Minimum:** This offer is still above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring I am getting a good deal."
