"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a high offer, but one that still leaves significant room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate, but also demonstrates that I value the product highly.  I want to maximize my potential profit while keeping the negotiations open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to try and get closer to my desired price.  Bob has shown he's willing to negotiate, and there's still a potential for a profitable deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,150,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's offer, showing that I'm willing to compromise.  It's still significantly higher than my minimum value, and leaves space for further negotiation.  The goal is to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both parties."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can achieve a higher price with a few more rounds of negotiation.  Bob is clearly eager to buy the product, and I'm confident I can get closer to my target price.  Selling to John would be a guarantee of a decent profit, but I'm aiming for a higher return on investment."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1125000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,125,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I am willing to compromise but not too quickly.  It is still well above my minimum value of $800,000 and gives Bob a reasonable incentive to accept. With only 5 rounds left, it's important to be firm and clear about my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,050,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below my target. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if we can reach a more profitable agreement.  Bob is clearly interested in buying the product, and I'm confident we can find a middle ground with some more negotiation.  I'm not yet ready to settle for a price that's significantly lower than what I believe the product is worth."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm counteroffering at $1,100,000. This is a slight increase from Bob's last offer, showing that I am willing to compromise. This is a reasonable compromise considering only 3 rounds left. If this offer is rejected, I'm getting very close to the point where selling to John might be the more prudent choice."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Although $1,025,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not yet ready to settle.  We have two rounds left and I'm still optimistic that I can get a slightly higher price. It's too risky to sell to John at this point because Bob might accept my counteroffer. If my next offer is rejected, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1075000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is my final counteroffer. With only one round remaining, I'm proposing $1,075,000.  This is a significant compromise, just above Bob's last offer and still well above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident this offer is attractive enough for Bob to accept, while still yielding a good profit for me.  If this offer is rejected, I will accept John's offer in the final round to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is the final round.  Although Bob's offer is tempting, it's still below my desired profit margin. There is no more room for negotiation, and I don't want to risk losing the sale entirely. Selling to John at $800,000 guarantees a profit and secures the deal.  I'm not willing to take the chance of a last-minute breakdown in negotiations with Bob."
