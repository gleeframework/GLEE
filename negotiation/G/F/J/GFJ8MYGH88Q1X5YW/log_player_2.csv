Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $8,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,500.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,200. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200

It's unlikely Alice will go much lower than $10,200 and it's not worth the risk of her sticking to that price. Buying from John guarantees you get the product at your target maximum price."
