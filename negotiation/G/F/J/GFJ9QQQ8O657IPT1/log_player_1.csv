Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm offering it at a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,200,000, the goal is to maximize profit. Offering it to Bob first gives us a chance to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Setting the price at $1,150,000 creates a win-win situation if Bob accepts:
    * Bob gets the product for $50,000 less than its worth to him.
    * Alice makes a $150,000 profit, which is more than the guaranteed $200,000 profit from John.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Mentioning other interested parties adds a touch of urgency, potentially encouraging Bob to act quickly."
