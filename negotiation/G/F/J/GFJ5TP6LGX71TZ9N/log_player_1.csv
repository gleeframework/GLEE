Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is a decent markup from my minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is a good compromise, especially since he rejected my initial offer.  Accepting this offer is the best way to maximize my profit while also avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the sale to John."
