Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $900,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $650,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $725,000.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about being fiscally responsible, but I'm still not willing to go as high as $710,000.

Alice has made it clear this is her final offer.  While I could push for a slightly lower price, it's unlikely I'll be able to get it much lower than $715,000. This price is significantly better than John's offer and within my budget."
