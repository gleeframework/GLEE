"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $16,000, which is a compromise between our two offers. Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $14,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value to me. I hope you'll reconsider.",14000.0,Bob,4,
