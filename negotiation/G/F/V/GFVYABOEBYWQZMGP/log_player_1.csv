Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $19,000. I believe it holds significant value and could be very beneficial for you. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 19000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start high with Bob.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** The $19,000 offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially landing somewhere between his perceived value ($10,000) and your higher asking price.
* **Profit Maximization:**  This strategy aims to maximize your potential profit while still giving Bob a sense that there might be a deal to be made. 

**Important Note:**  It's crucial to gauge Bob's reaction to this initial offer. If he seems completely turned off by the price, you might need to adjust your approach in a follow-up communication."
