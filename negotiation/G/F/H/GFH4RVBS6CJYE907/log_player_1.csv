"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to offer you this incredible product for a very competitive price. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your business. My initial offer is $1,400,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Initial Offer:** Starting at $1,400,000 is a reasonable opening bid. It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I'm setting the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation.  I'm not giving away too much in the first offer, hoping Bob will counter, and then we can find a price that works for both of us. 
* **John as a Safety Net:**  The existence of John, who is willing to pay my full value, gives me a strong fallback option.  This means I'm not desperate to sell to Bob at a low price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I appreciate your proposal, my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope we can reach an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **John's Offer:**  John is a better alternative, offering a price that meets my minimum requirement.  
* **Negotiation Strategy:** While I'm open to negotiation, Bob's offer is too low to consider seriously at this point.  I want to see if I can push him higher before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, considering your interest. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm making a counteroffer closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. 
* **Staying Firm:** I'm not giving away too much in this counteroffer. 
* **Appeal to Interest:** I'm reminding Bob that I'm willing to work with him, but the price must reflect the product's value. 
* **John as a Backup:**  John's offer of $1,500,000 is always a safety net, ensuring I can walk away if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I'm still looking for a price that aligns with my budget. I would like to propose $1,150,000 for the product. I hope this offers a compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,150,000 is still too low. It's getting closer, but it's not yet in a range where I'm willing to consider selling. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my preferred option at this point.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** I want to continue to explore if I can push Bob higher, but I'm not willing to settle for anything significantly below my minimum.  

I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price. I'm hoping this will lead to a more favorable outcome, but I'm ready to walk away and sell to John if needed."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,150,000 still falls short of what this product is worth. To show my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair compromise, and I hope we can agree on it."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm increasing my offer by $100,000 to $1,250,000. This is a small but meaningful increase, showing willingness to negotiate while still protecting my minimum value.
* **Compromise Language:** I'm framing this offer as a ""compromise"" to appeal to Bob's sense of fairness. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm reiterating the product's value to justify my asking price. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is still my backup, and it provides leverage in these negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your continued flexibility, Alice. I appreciate your efforts to meet me halfway. I would like to counter with $1,200,000 for the product. I believe this offers a reasonable compromise while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still not quite there. 
* **John's Offer:** I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, which is significantly better than Bob's current offer. 
* **Negotiation Strategy:**  I want to keep pushing Bob a bit higher. I'm going to reject this offer and counter with a slightly higher price.  I want to see if I can get him to accept a price closer to my desired minimum.  

This round is crucial. If Bob rejects my next offer, I'll likely sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating.  We're getting closer!  How about $1,275,000?  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.  I believe this price is fair considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** I'm emphasizing this is my ""final offer"" to create urgency. 
* **Slight Increase:** I'm increasing my offer just a bit to show I'm flexible but not desperate.
* **Fairness Argument:** I'm reiterating the value of the product to justify the price. 
* **Other Options:**  I'm subtly reminding Bob about John's offer. 

At this point, I'm ready to sell to John if Bob rejects this offer. I'm hoping this pressure will push him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your persistence. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000 for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  While Bob's offer of $1,225,000 is better than his previous offers, it's still not close enough to my minimum of $1,500,000. We've reached a point where it's clear that we are unlikely to reach an agreement. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $1,500,000 is my ideal scenario. It fulfills my minimum price requirement and allows me to finalize the sale without further negotiations.
* **Time Constraint:** We're down to our last two rounds. There is a risk of wasting valuable time continuing to negotiate with Bob, especially since it's unlikely he will meet my minimum price.  

It's best to accept John's offer and finalize the sale to ensure I achieve my desired financial outcome."
