"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be interested in. It's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $140. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

 Alice's starting price is too high. There's room to negotiate a better deal.  I'll counter-offer and see what she says."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $110 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $125? That's still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:

While closer to a reasonable price, $125 is still more than I want to pay. I'll try to negotiate a bit further."
