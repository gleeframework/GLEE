{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal, and I know you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price higher than my minimum, but I'm also aware that Bob has a strong baseline value for the product. This approach gives me room to negotiate while keeping the door open to a successful sale with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the product, but I am only willing to pay $12,000 for it. Would you be able to accommodate this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price. Accepting his offer guarantees me the best possible outcome, considering John is also willing to pay $12,000. There's no point in risking a counteroffer that might not be accepted."
