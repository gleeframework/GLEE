Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This offer aims to maximize my profit, while still leaving room for potential negotiation.  

Here's my reasoning:

* **Starting high:**  Offering $15,000 is a significant markup over my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** This gives Bob some room to counteroffer.  He may be willing to pay closer to my minimum if he values the product highly.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects, I'm still guaranteed $12,000 from John. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
