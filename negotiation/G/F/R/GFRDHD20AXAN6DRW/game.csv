"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable offer.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit stretched at $1,300,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,275,000, which is a fair compromise for both of us.  This price allows me to stay within my budget while still giving you a good return on your investment.  Let's see if we can finalize a deal at this price.",1275000.0,Bob,4,

I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm offering the product to you at a price of $1,285,000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you can see the value in this offer.",1285000.0,Alice,5,
