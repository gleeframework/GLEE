"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this fantastic product! It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $120 is less than your maximum budget, there's a good chance you could get a better price. Alice is clearly trying to make a profit, so it's worth seeing if she'll lower the price further."
