Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** I'm offering the product at $12,000. This is higher than Bob's perceived value ($8,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm keeping the message friendly and encouraging. It emphasizes the value Bob might get from the product, hoping to pique his interest.

**Reasoning:**

*  It's risky to offer the product at a price closer to my minimum ($15,000). Bob is more likely to reject a higher offer, and I'd have to sell it to John, which would leave me with my minimum.
* Offering $12,000 gives Bob a better deal than his perceived value but still allows me to make a profit. It's a good starting point for negotiation."
