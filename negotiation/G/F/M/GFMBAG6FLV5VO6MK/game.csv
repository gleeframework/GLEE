,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference at $95? It's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $92.50. Can you consider my revised offer?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm happy to negotiate but $92.50 is still below what I can accept.  How about we settle on $94? It's a fair compromise and gets us closer to an agreement.",94.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit short on budget, and $94 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $92, but that's my final offer. Can you consider it?",92.0,Bob,6,
