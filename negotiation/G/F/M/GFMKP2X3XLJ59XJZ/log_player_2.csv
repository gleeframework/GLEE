You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  $600,000 is a significantly lower price than Bob's maximum budget of $1,500,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice before resorting to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 400000}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is starting with a significantly lower counteroffer than Alice's initial price. This is a strong opening move, signaling to Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating a lower price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  While $500,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's counteroffer. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if Alice is willing to come down closer to $400,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 450000}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is increasing his counteroffer slightly to $450,000. This shows Alice that he's willing to compromise but still wants a price closer to his initial offer. It's a strategic move to gauge Alice's willingness to meet in the middle."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $475,000 is now very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $450,000.  It's likely that further negotiation won't lead to a significantly lower price.  Accepting the offer saves Bob a lot of money compared to buying from John and allows him to secure the product."
