{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140. I think it's a fair price, considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $140 is more than your minimum of $120, ensuring you make a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $140 is less than Bob's value of $150, making it potentially attractive to him.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's still space for both of you to negotiate and potentially find a price you're both happy with."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $130 for the product. I hope this aligns better with my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer is $130, which is above my minimum of $120.  Accepting this offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation or selling to John for a lower price."
