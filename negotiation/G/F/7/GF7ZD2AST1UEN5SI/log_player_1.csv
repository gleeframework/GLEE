{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly trying to wear me down to his initial offer of $800,000. However, his counteroffers are slowly increasing, showing he's willing to move. I'm confident I can still negotiate a better price than his current offer and my guaranteed sale to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  To show you I'm serious about closing this deal, I'm willing to accept $851,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it reflects the true value of the product."",
""product_price"": 851000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** By stating this is my final offer, I'm signaling to Bob that I'm not willing to go any lower and he needs to be serious about his counteroffer. 
* **Slight Concession:**  I've come down slightly from my previous offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm holding firm above his $840,000.
* **Time Pressure:** We're getting closer to the end of the negotiation rounds, which adds a subtle pressure for Bob to make a decision."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Diminishing Returns:** While I could try to push for a bit more, the potential gains are shrinking compared to the risk of Bob walking away. 
* **Strong Offer:**  $845,000 is a significant profit above my minimum, and it's unlikely Bob will go much higher.
* **Time Remaining:** With only a few rounds left, accepting now secures a good deal without the uncertainty of continued negotiation."
