{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm about the product, but  $950,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $825,000 for it. This is my best offer, considering the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $875,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $825,000. It's a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable transaction for both of us."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thank you for your persistence and patience. After careful consideration, I am willing to lower the price to $850000.
