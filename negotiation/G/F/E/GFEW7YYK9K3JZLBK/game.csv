"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway on our initial proposals. How about $1,300,000? This would be a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider this offer?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from my target price.  How about we split the difference?  $1,275,000 would be a fair price, and it's a good compromise.  This gives us both a win and allows us to close the deal. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,225,000, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
