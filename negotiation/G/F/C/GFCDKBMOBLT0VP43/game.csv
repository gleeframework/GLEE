"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discussed, I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value is $1000000 to you. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $900000 is still a bit higher than I was hoping to pay. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $850000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1000000. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $850000 is still a bit higher than I was thinking. I'd be willing to go up to $820000, but that's as high as I can go. I'm starting to think about buying from John at $1000000 if we can't meet in the middle.",820000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your honesty. I'm willing to meet you at $820000, but I need to get closer to the product's true value to you.

"I'm starting to feel like we're getting close, Alice. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but that's as low as I can go. If we can't meet at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John at $1000000. Can you think about it?",825000.0,Bob,6,
