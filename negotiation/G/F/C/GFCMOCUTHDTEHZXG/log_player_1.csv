Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you want to start high with Bob. 
* **Strategic negotiation:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Justification:** The message highlights the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""unique value proposition"" to justify the high price. 

This approach aims to maximize your profit with Bob while having the safety net of John's offer."
