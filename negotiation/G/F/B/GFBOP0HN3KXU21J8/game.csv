"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value item. I'm looking to sell it to you for $15000. It's a rare and sought-after product that I'm confident you'll find valuable. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $9000. I'm willing to consider it, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $12000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I'm hoping we can find a mutually agreeable price.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a deal. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I can do $11000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $9500. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,
