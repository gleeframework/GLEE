"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the asking price of $12000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $8500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I'll offer you the product for $10500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a great value.",10500.0,Alice,3,
