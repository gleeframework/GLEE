Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, based on my research and budget, I am unable to meet the asking price of $12000. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower offer? I am willing to pay up to $8500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
