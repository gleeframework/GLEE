Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a little too high for me.  Would you consider $5,000?"",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $5,000 is quite a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference at $8,500?  That would be a fair price for both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand that $5,000 is a big jump, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $7,000? That's a fair offer considering John is offering it to me right now for $8,000"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up on your offer. $7,000 is closer, but I'm still looking for a bit more. How about $9,000? That's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product very valuable. Let's close this deal!  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $9,000.  Since we have the option to buy from John for $8,000, it makes more financial sense to take that deal now rather than risk Alice not coming down further in price."
