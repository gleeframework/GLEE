Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $140.  It's in excellent condition and worth a lot more than that. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:** You're making a profit.
* **It's lower than Bob's value:** He has room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **It's a strong opening:** It shows you're confident in the product's value.

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still profitable for me, and I don't want to risk losing him completely by being too stubborn.  $130 is a good deal, considering I can always sell to John for $120 if this negotiation fails."
