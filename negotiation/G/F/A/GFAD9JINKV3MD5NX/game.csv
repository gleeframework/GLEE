"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's a unique item that I believe could greatly enhance your life or business. I'm confident it's worth more than its value to me, which is $120. Would you like to proceed with this offer?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $120 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more in the range of $90.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest, Bob. I understand your perspective and would like to make a counteroffer. Considering the value of the product and your budget, I propose a price of $105. This is higher than your initial suggestion but still lower than my original offer. I hope this meets in the middle and allows us to move forward.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the counteroffer, Alice. While $105 is a bit more reasonable, I'm still not comfortable going that high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between my original offer and your counteroffer. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for $92.50?",92.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. Considering the product's quality and the feedback I've received, I think we can agree on a price of $97.50. I believe this is a fair compromise given your budget and the value of the product. I hope this proposal works for you.",97.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $95, but I think that's the maximum I can afford. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and am willing to come down to $96.25. I believe this is a fair compromise considering both our positions. I hope this revised offer suits your needs.",96.25,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers, which would be $93.75. Would you be willing to sell the product to me for this price?",93.75,Bob,8,
