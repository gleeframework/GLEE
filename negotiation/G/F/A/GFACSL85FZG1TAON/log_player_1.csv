Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counteroffers. I'm confident I can get a good price for the product, as it's worth at least $1,500,000 to me.  I'll be ready to counter if needed, and I can always fall back on John's offer if Bob doesn't meet my expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is way too low. It's less than my minimum acceptable value. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I'm not ready to settle for such a low price."

I'm offering $1,750,000, which is still a good profit for me and hopefully more appealing to Bob. It's a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing flexibility, but still well above his initial offer. I'm hoping this will be a good starting point for a more productive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable value. While it's closer to my initial price than his first counteroffer, I'm not ready to sell at that price yet. I'll make another counteroffer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $1,600,000.  This is a slight decrease from my previous offer but still above my minimum acceptable value. I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate but also that I won't be swayed by lowball offers."
