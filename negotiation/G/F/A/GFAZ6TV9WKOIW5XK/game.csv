"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's truly one-of-a-kind and I believe it holds immense value for the right buyer. I'm starting the negotiation with a price of $1200000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $900000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value you've described.  Let me know your thoughts.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position and appreciate your interest. While $900000 is closer to what I envisioned,  I need to make a slightly higher price to make this deal worthwhile for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This reflects the unique value of this product and allows for a mutually beneficial outcome.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
