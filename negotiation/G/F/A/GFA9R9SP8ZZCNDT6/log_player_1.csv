Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with my desired price, $1,000,000, as this is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I know Bob values the product at $800,000, so there is room for negotiation, but I'm starting high to see if he's willing to meet my initial expectations.  I'll be ready to negotiate down if needed, but I want to see how much he's willing to pay upfront."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my valuation, I'm still not satisfied. I believe I can get closer to my desired price, especially since selling to John guarantees me $1,000,000. I'll reject Bob's offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my price to $950,000, which is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while still leaving some room for further compromise if needed. I believe this price is a fair compromise and gives Bob a better deal than John's offer without compromising too much on my desired earnings."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still below my desired price.  At this point, it's becoming a risk to continue negotiating with Bob, as it's taking up time and he may not budge much further. Selling to John guarantees me my desired price of $1,000,000, so it's the most secure and profitable option at this moment."
