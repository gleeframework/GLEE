"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product! It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it can be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,150,000. Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Would you be willing to consider this offer?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this sale worthwhile.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value you see in the product and allows me to achieve my target.",1025000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. This is the highest I can go, so I hope we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $975,000 is still quite a bit below my minimum. Let's try to bridge the gap further. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a fair price considering the value you see in this product. This offer is firm, but I'm confident it's a win-win for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $950,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $995,000. This is my final offer, so I hope we can find a way to agree on a price.",995000.0,Bob,6,
