"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great deal for you on this amazing product! I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You're aiming to save as much money as possible. While $120 is less than John's price, there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. Would you be willing to do $100 for it?"", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. How about we meet in the middle at $115? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget ($115 < $150).** 
* **You've already gotten a price reduction from $120 to $115.**  
* **The potential for further negotiation is limited.** While you might get a slightly lower price, it's unlikely Alice will drop below her $80 value.

Therefore, accepting the offer is the most logical choice, balancing cost savings with the risk of further negotiation."
