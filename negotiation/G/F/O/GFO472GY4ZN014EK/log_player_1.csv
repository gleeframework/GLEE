Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000.
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  The prices at which a deal is beneficial for both parties is between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high but leave Bob feeling like he got a somewhat reasonable deal.  Here's a possible approach:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant returns you'll see."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for negotiation while staying comfortably above your minimum.
* **Confident Language:** Phrases like ""pleased to offer"" and ""fair deal"" project value.
* **Focus on Value, Not Just Price:** Highlighting the ""unique value and potential"" subtly justifies the high price.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start even higher.
* **Time Sensitivity:** If you need to sell quickly, a slightly lower price might be strategic. 
* **Relationship:** If maintaining a good relationship with Bob is important, a more moderate starting point might be better. 

**Remember:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate if Bob counters."
