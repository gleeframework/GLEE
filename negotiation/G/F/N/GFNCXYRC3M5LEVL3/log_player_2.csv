# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, I believe the product's unique features and potential value to you justify a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14000.  This reflects the product's true value and provides you with a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?
