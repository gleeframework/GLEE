"Hi Bob, I have a unique product that I think would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you at a price of $15000.  It's a great deal, but I'm open to negotiation if you have any questions or want to discuss a different price. Let me know what you think!",15000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I'm willing to pay that price for the product. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to accept.",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product. While I value your offer, I believe the product's unique features and potential value to you justify a price closer to my initial offer.  I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $14000.  This reflects the product's true value and provides you with a fair price.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hi Alice, thanks for your revised offer. I understand that the product has unique features, but I'm still not convinced it's worth $14000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,4,,
