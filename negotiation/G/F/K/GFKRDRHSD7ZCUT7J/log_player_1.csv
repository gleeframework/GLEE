Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Bob values the product at $1,200,000. 
* **The Zone of Possible Agreement (ZOPA):**  Exists between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  Any price within this range could potentially benefit both of you.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high, but not so high that Bob automatically rejects your offer.  There's no harm in starting with an offer closer to your ideal outcome.

**The Offer**

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:** You're confidently stating the product's value.
* **High but Negotiable:**  The price is below your guaranteed amount from John, leaving room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **No Justification:** You're not giving Bob a reason to haggle you down immediately. If he wants a lower price, he'll need to counter-offer and explain his reasoning. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to negotiate.  You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before walking away and accepting John's offer."
