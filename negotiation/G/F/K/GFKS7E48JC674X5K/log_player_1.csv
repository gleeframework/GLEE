Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. My asking price is $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer starts at a price slightly higher than what Bob is willing to pay, but it's still below what I want for the product. This strategy aims to:

* **Start strong:**  A slightly higher price helps set the tone that I'm not desperate to sell.
* **Leave room for negotiation:** I have space to lower the price if Bob counters, without dropping below my minimum.
* **Show willingness to compromise:** I'm demonstrating that I'm open to finding a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $135 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. Would you consider $125? That's still a good price for you and a fair deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could accept his offer and make a profit, I'm going to try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, how about $130? That's still a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you want to make a profit, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really looking for something closer to $125.  If you're willing to meet me halfway, I think we can make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $127. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $127
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $127 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm still not comfortable with it. I've already lowered my price a bit and Bob seems to be pushing for the lowest possible price. I'm confident I can sell to John for $150, so I'm going to cut my losses and move on."
