"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $12,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $9,000 right now.  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is your maximum, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $10,500 is still a bit out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $9,500, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's try to find a middle ground.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,500. I'm willing to come down a bit more and offer it to you for $10,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",10000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $10,000 is tempting, I'm still hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm prepared to offer $9,750.  This is a very fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to you. Let's see if we can close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $9,750. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10,000 and $9,750, which would be $9,875. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can meet at this price.",9875.0,Alice,7,
