"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $18,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. Can you consider that?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However, the product's value is truly significant, and $12,000 is below what I can accept.  Could you do $15,000? I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price given the product's benefits.",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $15,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13,500. Can you consider that?",13500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. Let's close this gap. How about $14,250? This feels like a fair compromise.",14250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $13,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider that?",13000.0,Bob,6,
