"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $60 is a good price, it's still worth exploring if you can get it lower.  Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 45}
```

**Reasoning:**  Starting with a counteroffer of $45 is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price of $60. This shows Alice that you are serious about negotiating and are willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  The $45 price is still within your budget, but leaves room for negotiation and potentially a win-win scenario for both of you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $55. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $55
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** While $55 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, it's still higher than my ideal price point. There are still rounds available for negotiation, and it's worth pushing for a lower price before considering the $100 option from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 50}
```

**Reasoning:**  I'm increasing my offer to $50. This shows Alice I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a price that's closer to my ideal target. The $50 offer is also within my budget, and it leaves room for Alice to accept or make a counteroffer in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $52. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $52
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Alice's offer of $52 is now very close to my ideal price point.  It's within my budget and leaves me some room for saving compared to buying from John.  With only 5 rounds left, it's unlikely that I'll be able to negotiate a much lower price, so accepting Alice's offer is the best option at this point."
