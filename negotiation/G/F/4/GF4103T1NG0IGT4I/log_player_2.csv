Bob should reject Alice's offer. $11,000 is more than his maximum budget of $8,000. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice before considering buying from John."

{""product_price"": 8500}
``` 

Bob is offering $8,500, which is a significant discount from Alice's initial price of $11,000. This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation, as it's still a bit above Bob's maximum budget, but leaves room for Alice to come down a little."
