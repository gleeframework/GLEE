Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,000,000. While Bob is moving in the right direction, I'm not ready to settle just yet.  There's still potential for a better deal."
