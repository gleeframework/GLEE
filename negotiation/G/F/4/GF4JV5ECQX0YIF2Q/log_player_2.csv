"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its incredible value, I believe a starting price of $1,100,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Alice's offer is quite high, considering her valuation of the product. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in the product but $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $900,000?"",
""product_price"": 900000
}
``` 

This counter-offer attempts to bring the price down significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I recognize your perspective, $900,000 undervalues the product significantly. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what I'm offering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

```

Alice is moving in the right direction but still leaving a lot of room for profit. It's worth countering again to see if the price can be driven down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number I'm comfortable with. How about $950,000?"",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

This counter-offer shows Alice that we're willing to move up, but still aiming for a price significantly below her initial offer. This keeps the negotiation moving while maintaining a target well below John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer.  Let's split the difference - $1,000,000, and we have a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we could try to negotiate further, $1,000,000 is a reasonable price, saving $200,000 compared to John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go much lower, and we risk pushing her away if we counter again. Accepting now secures a good deal."
