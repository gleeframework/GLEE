"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I'm looking for a serious buyer who can appreciate its worth. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $20000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I think $20000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $15000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",15000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $18000. I believe the product's value justifies this price. Would you be willing to consider this revised offer?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $18000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $16000, but that's as high as I can go. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",16000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your budget constraints, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to meet you at $17000, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. I believe the product's value is worth more, but I'm willing to compromise to find a mutually beneficial deal. What do you think?",17000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but I think that's the maximum I can go. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.",16500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm starting to think that we're getting close to a fair price. I'm willing to meet you at $16750, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. This is as close as I can get to your offer without compromising the product's value. What do you think?",16750.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you at $16500, but I think that's the absolute maximum I can go. I'm really hoping we can meet in the middle.",16500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I think we've been dancing around this price for a while now. I'm willing to make one final compromise. I'll meet you at $16250. This is as close as I can get to your offer without sacrificing the product's value. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16250.0,Alice,9,
