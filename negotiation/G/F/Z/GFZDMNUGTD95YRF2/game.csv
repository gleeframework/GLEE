"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!",11000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my original offer.  How about $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, Alice, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your original offer and my initial counteroffer. How about $10,250? That's the best I can do for now.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $10,250 is closer, but it's still a little below where I need to be. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to go down to $10,375. That way, we both come out a bit ahead.  Let's make this deal happen.",10375.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $10,375 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but this time, I'll go down to $10,200. That's the best I can do for now.",10200.0,Bob,6,
