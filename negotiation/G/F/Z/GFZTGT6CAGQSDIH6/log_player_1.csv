Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1700000} 
```

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum, but lower than what I could get from John. This leaves room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to come closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum but still lower than my desired price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my value in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}

I'm counteroffering at $1,600,000. This is halfway between my initial offer and Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to compromise but still want a price closer to my value."

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  John is offering my desired price, so I'll sell to him."
