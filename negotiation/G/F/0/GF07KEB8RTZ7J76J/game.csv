"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this fantastic product with you. I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $12,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial agreement, but I'm looking to get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate.  While I acknowledge the value of the product, $12,000 is a bit steep for me at this point.  I'm happy to discuss a price closer to $10,000.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable middle ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you a price of $11,500. This is a fair price, taking into account my initial investment and the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  While $11,500 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still hoping to find a price closer to $11,000.  This would allow us both to come away satisfied with the deal. What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to $11,000, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer you a price of $11,250. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
