"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",9500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While I value your willingness to negotiate, $9,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  This gives us both a good deal, and I'm confident you'll still find the product very valuable. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice. I've considered your last offer, but I'm still unable to go beyond $10,000. I believe this is a fair price given the current market conditions and the value I expect to receive from the product. I look forward to your response.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued negotiation.  $10,000 is a better offer, but I'm still very close to my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to go down to $10,500. This is my final offer. Let me know if you're interested, or I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, thank you for considering my previous offers. I appreciate your flexibility. However, I am still not able to go above $10,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its current market value. I hope you can meet me halfway.",10000.0,Bob,6,
