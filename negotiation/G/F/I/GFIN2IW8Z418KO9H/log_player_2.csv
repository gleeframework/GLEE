"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to own this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $8000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her actual valuation of the product, it's still above your maximum budget. You have a better option to buy from John at a lower price, so rejecting the offer and counter-offering makes sense."

Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer you the product for $10500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum budget. Although she has lowered her price, it's still not in your best interest to accept. You can still buy from John for a lower price, making it a better choice to reject Alice's offer and counter-offer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to compromise.  However, $10,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to offer you $9,500, which is a significant step up from my initial offer and represents a good deal for both of us.  I'm hoping we can come to an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 9500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $9500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10500 and $9500. I'm offering you the product for $10000. This is the best price I can offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counter-offer is still above your maximum budget, and you've already made several counter-offers. It's likely that further negotiation will lead to a price closer to her valuation than yours.  At this point, it's more beneficial to buy the product from John at a guaranteed lower price."
