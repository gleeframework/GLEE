"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $100 by you. Considering its quality and the value it brings, I would like to propose a price of $95 for this exceptional item. I believe this offer strikes a fair balance between compensating me adequately for my product and staying within your budget expectations. Thank you for considering this proposal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $95.** This is within your budget of $100.
* **Buying from John costs $100.** This is more expensive than Alice's offer.

Since you want to save as much money as possible, it makes sense to accept Alice's offer and buy the product for $95."
