"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14000. This is a very competitive price, considering its value to you is $15000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $14,000 is a good deal compared to John's offer of $15,000, there is still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I have to make sure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14200 for it. This is my final offer for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,200.

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $14100. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $14300 for it. This is my last offer before considering other options. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,300.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice.  While $14,300 is a better price than John's $15,000, there's not enough time to try and get a lower price from Alice. It's likely Alice will hold firm at $14,300, and Bob would be better off accepting John's offer to guarantee a purchase within his budget."
