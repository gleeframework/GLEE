Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. With that said, I'm willing to offer you the product for $11,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. I'm confident you'll find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm ready to buy the product today, but I need a price closer to my budget.  I'm offering $9,500.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still looking to get a fair price for the product.

This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10500}"
