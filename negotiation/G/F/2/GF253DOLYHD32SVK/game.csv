"Hey Bob, thanks for the offer, but I can't go that low. I'm willing to come down a bit more to $95. That's still a great price for you and it gives me a bit more room to negotiate. Let me know what you think.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $95 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really serious about buying this product, but $90 is my absolute limit. Let's see if we can make this work.",90.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $90 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you halfway at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us. What do you think?",92.5,Alice,5,
