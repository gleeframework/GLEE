{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is close to my minimum value but still leaves room for negotiation. It's a good starting point that shows I'm serious about selling to Bob but also willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I believe that's a fair price for the product considering its value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, it's still significantly below what I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $12,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $13,000? I'm confident this is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to meet in the middle, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go to $13,000. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $12,500 is closer to my ideal price and significantly better than selling to John for $10,000. It's time to accept his offer and finalize the deal."
