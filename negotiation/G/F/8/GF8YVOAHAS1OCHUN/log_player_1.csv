Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and the product's value to you. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.

I'll accept Bob's offer. While I'd prefer to get closer to $14,000, this deal is still above my minimum, and I'm getting closer to the end of the rounds. It's a good compromise."
