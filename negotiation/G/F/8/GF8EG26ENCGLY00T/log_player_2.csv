Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're on a tight budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $1,075,000. What do you think?

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within your budget and represents a good deal, considering you are aiming for $1,000,000.  There is no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, and you risk losing the opportunity altogether."
