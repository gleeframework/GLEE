"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you've placed on the product, I'm hoping to secure it for a slightly lower price. I'm willing to pay $850,000. This offer reflects the value I see in the product and is a fair price considering your own valuation.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your desire to secure the product at a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This price still reflects the product's value to you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
