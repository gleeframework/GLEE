Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $12,000. I believe it provides significant value at this price."", ""product_price"": 12000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with a price higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a better deal. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial high price will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential budget. 
* **Fallback Option:** You always have the option to negotiate down or accept John's offer of $8,000 if negotiations with Bob don't go as planned."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. May I suggest a counteroffer of $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While $9,500 is a decent offer, there's still room for negotiation. Bob's message suggests he's trying to negotiate a lower price, but he's still interested.  Rejecting his offer and making a counteroffer keeps the negotiation open and gives you a chance to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price. While I believe the product offers significant value at my initial offer, I'm willing to consider coming down slightly. How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?"", ""product_price"": 11000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Show Flexibility:** Countering shows you're willing to negotiate, which is important for building rapport.
* **Strategic Concession:** Coming down by $1,000 is a significant amount, demonstrating flexibility while still aiming for a higher price. 
* **Anchoring:** By proposing $11,000, you're anchoring the negotiation closer to your initial price, potentially influencing Bob's next offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. Based on my research and budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $10,500. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:**  $10,500 is a significant profit above your minimum selling price of $8,000. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains and risks pushing Bob away. 
* **Time Value:**  Securing a deal now avoids the risk of prolonged negotiation and the potential loss of a sale to Bob."
