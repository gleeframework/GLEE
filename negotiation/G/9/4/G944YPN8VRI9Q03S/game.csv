"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree this product is unique, I'm not comfortable with that price point. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's true value to you, while also showing I'm willing to work with you to reach an agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a firm budget, and to make this work, I'd need to be closer to $750,000. Would that be something you could consider?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make one more concession. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm now offering the product to you for $825,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
