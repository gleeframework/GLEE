,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider something closer to $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but $700,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for something a bit lower.  How about $750,000? I believe that's a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to make one more concession to $825,000. This is as low as I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm ready to close this deal soon, but $825,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind. My final offer is $775,000. If this works for you, I'm ready to finalize everything. ",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $825,000. I'm starting to think we're too far apart, and I'd rather explore other options. However, I'll make one final offer: $810,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",810000.0,Alice,7,
