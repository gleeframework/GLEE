"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,400,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value I see in it. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is considerably below the product's true worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,125,000?",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I see you're willing to come down, and that's good. However, $1,125,000 is still more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference. I'll offer $950,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs and allows us to move forward.",950000.0,Bob,4,
