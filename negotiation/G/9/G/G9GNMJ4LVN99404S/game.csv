"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $8,000.  What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $8,000 is a bit too low for me. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $12,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price, but $12,000 is still a bit too steep for me. How about we settle at $10,000? That's a fair price considering it's my maximum budget.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I've already compromised a lot by moving from $18,000 to $12,000, and now I'm willing to meet you at $11,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept for this product. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,5,
