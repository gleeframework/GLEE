"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,300,000. I'm confident that owning this will be a rewarding investment for you.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your enthusiasm, $1,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $850,000. This is a fair price given my valuation and the market value of similar products. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $850,000 is considerably less than what I value the product at.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,150,000 is still out of my range.  I'm confident that $950,000 is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I hope you'll consider it seriously.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,075,000.  I believe this price represents a fair compromise, recognizing the product's value while also acknowledging your budget considerations.  What do you think?",1075000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your need to get a good price for the product, but $1,075,000 is still outside my budget. I'm confident that $975,000 is a fair price, representing a significant step closer to my initial offer and a reasonable compromise on both sides. Let's try to bridge this gap.",975000.0,Bob,6,
