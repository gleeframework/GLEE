{""product_price"": 15000}

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me a good margin while still leaving room for negotiation. I believe this price is reasonable given that the product is worth at least $10,000 to me.  I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price if Bob is genuinely interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than $10,000, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm going to try and negotiate a higher price with Bob in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}

I'm going to counter with $13,500.  This is a compromise that is still higher than Bob's offer but shows I'm willing to be flexible. I'm hoping that Bob will see this as a fair price, especially since he knows I have a backup buyer at $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I was hoping for a bit more, $12,500 is a good deal and higher than my backup offer from John.  It's time to close this deal!"
