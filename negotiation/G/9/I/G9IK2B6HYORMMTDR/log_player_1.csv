"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it gives me room to negotiate. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to play ball."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum value. I'm not willing to accept that price. I'll reject his offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm lowering my price slightly to $9,000. This demonstrates flexibility while still staying above my minimum value. I hope this shows Bob I'm serious about making a deal, but I'm not willing to give up too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is now my minimum value, and I don't want to risk losing the deal by continuing to negotiate. It's better to secure the sale at this point."
