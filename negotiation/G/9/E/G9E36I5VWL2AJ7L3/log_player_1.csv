Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you shouldn't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, meaning there's a potential profit margin for him if he buys from you.
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you a negotiation advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim for a price that's close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation without scaring him off. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value proposition, I'm confident it will generate significant returns for your business. I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Exclusivity:**  Phrasing the offer as ""exclusive"" adds a layer of appeal.
* **Value Proposition:** Highlighting the product's ""unique value"" subtly reinforces its worth. 
* **Confident Tone:**  Projecting confidence in the price makes it seem more reasonable.
* **Pricing Strategy:**  $1,350,000 is a strong starting point. It gives you room to negotiate down slightly if needed while still securing a significant profit above your minimum.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer. You'll need to decide how low you're willing to go before accepting his offer or walking away and selling to John."
