"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a competitive offer. I'm proposing a price of $1,200,000 for the product.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'm more interested in a price closer to $650,000.  What do you think?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you consider $725,000? I think that's a fair offer that reflects the value I place on the product.",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $725,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I think I can do a bit better than that. I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,5,
