Alice's offer:

I'm proposing a price of $900,000 for the product. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

I'm proposing a price of $850,000 for the product. This is the highest I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $800,000. It makes more sense to take the guaranteed deal from John at your target price."
