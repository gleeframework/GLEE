"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for your business. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,400,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I believe this is a fair starting point considering the potential return on investment for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $1,400,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $1,500,000. It's worth exploring a counteroffer to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? This offer reflects the value I believe it brings to your specific needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is within my budget and is a reasonable compromise.  While I could potentially try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice will not go lower than $1,300,000, which is still outside my desired range.  Accepting this offer saves me $150,000 compared to buying from John."
