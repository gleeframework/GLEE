Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a chance to purchase this valuable product. I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. Given its worth, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000."", ""product_price"": 1800000} 
 
**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly higher offer creates room for negotiation and allows you to potentially secure a price much closer to Bob's maximum valuation. While there's a risk of Bob rejecting the offer initially, the potential reward of a higher selling price outweighs the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,800,000 is a bit too high for me. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is higher than your guaranteed sale to John, but still significantly lower than your initial ask. There's room for negotiation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you're aiming for a higher price and are willing to engage in further bargaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective, but I believe the product's true value is significantly higher.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

**Reasoning:**  

* **Show Flexibility but Hold Ground:** We're coming down from the initial offer to demonstrate willingness to negotiate, but not drastically. A drop of $200,000 shows movement while still aiming for a price significantly above Bob's offer.
* **Target Above Midpoint:** This counteroffer sits closer to your initial ask, aiming to establish a higher baseline for the negotiation. 
* **Maintain John as Backup:**  We're still above John's offer, leaving that option open if negotiations stall or Bob's counteroffers remain unreasonable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is a significant profit of $300,000 above your guaranteed sale price to John. 
* **Negotiation Progress:** Bob has consistently increased his offer, indicating his strong interest in the product. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While there might be a slight chance of pushing for more, the risk of Bob walking away increases with each counteroffer. Accepting now secures a very favorable outcome."
