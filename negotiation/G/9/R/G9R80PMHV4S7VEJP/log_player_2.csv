Bob should reject the offer. The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice is asking for $1,800,000. This is a significant markup. Bob should counteroffer and try to negotiate a better price."

Bob should still reject the offer.  While Alice has come down in price, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He should continue to negotiate and see if he can get closer to his goal of $1,000,000."
