"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

Alice's offer is too high. It's much closer to her valuation than mine. I should try to negotiate it down significantly."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm thinking closer to $6,000 would be more reasonable. What do you say?"",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $12,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $9,500. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,500 is still a bit beyond what I'm comfortable spending. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair deal to me."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make another concession. I'm thinking of offering it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?

Alice is getting closer to my limit, but I'm still better off buying from John at this point. One more counteroffer should make my position clear."

Round 7

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is your final offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that price.

What do you think?
