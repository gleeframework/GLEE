"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $11,000?",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $11,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,500? It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, $12,500 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $11,750?  That's a significant jump from my previous offer and shows I'm serious about buying.",11750.0,Bob,4,
