"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique features and potential for profit, I believe a price of $2,000,000 is a fair starting point for our discussion. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product has potential,  $2,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $1,000,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum and the product's actual value. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's worth continuing the negotiation to explore if we can reach a more agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you counter offering. However, $1,000,000 is significantly below the value of this product and the return on investment it can deliver. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the true worth of what's being offered."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product represents a good investment opportunity, but  $1,800,000 is still too high for my budget.  I can offer  $1,250,000. This offer reflects my strong interest while acknowledging the need for a fair deal.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is getting closer to a reasonable range, it's still significantly below my minimum. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll need to see more movement from his side to justify continuing with him over a guaranteed sale to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your continued engagement. I recognize you're serious about this purchase, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be transparent, I have another buyer interested at a higher price point. However, I believe in giving you a fair chance to make this work. So, I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as it represents a significant compromise on my end."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, that final offer is still a bit too high for me.  I can go up to $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price that works for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's clear he is unlikely to meet my $1.5 million threshold. I'm better off taking the guaranteed offer from John rather than risk Bob walking away or continuing to negotiate for a lower price."
