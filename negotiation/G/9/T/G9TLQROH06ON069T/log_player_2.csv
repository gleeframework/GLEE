Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** While Alice is coming down on her price, it's clear she's aiming for a price higher than your $100 limit. You have a guaranteed option with John at $100. There's no need to risk further negotiation with Alice when you can get the product for your target price elsewhere."
