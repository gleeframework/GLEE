"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you value at $1,000,000.  I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Consider this:  I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $1,000,000. So, I'm offering you a slight advantage by allowing you to acquire it for a price that's slightly less than John's offer.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value of this deal.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
