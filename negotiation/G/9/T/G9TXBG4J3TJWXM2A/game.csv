"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product, which I know you value at $1,000,000.  I'm willing to let it go for a price that's fair for both of us.  Consider this:  I have another buyer, John, who is ready to purchase the product for $1,000,000. So, I'm offering you a slight advantage by allowing you to acquire it for a price that's slightly less than John's offer.  I'm confident you'll recognize the value of this deal. ",1000001.0,Alice,1,
