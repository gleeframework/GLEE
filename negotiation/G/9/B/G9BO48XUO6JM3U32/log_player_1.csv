"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, aiming for a significant portion of Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation while still securing a profitable deal for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer. I believe there is still room for negotiation and I can potentially secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but still aiming for a significant profit.  I believe this counteroffer is reasonable and likely to be accepted by Bob.  He has shown a willingness to negotiate and this offer is closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price and believe that Bob is likely to increase his offer. Selling to John for $800,000 is my fallback option, but I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm lowering my price again, but I'm confident Bob is willing to meet me halfway. This price is closer to his last offer, and it's a good compromise considering the potential for a deal with John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm not going to accept his offer just yet. I believe there's still room for negotiation. Selling to John is still a viable option, but I'm hoping to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1025000}
```

I'm making one last small adjustment to my price, bringing it closer to Bob's last offer.  This shows a willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's advantageous to me.  With only a few rounds left, I need to be more flexible to avoid ending up with John's lower offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $990,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $990,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price, we're nearing the end of negotiations.  With only two rounds remaining, accepting Bob's offer of $990,000 is the best choice. It's significantly higher than John's offer, and it's likely Bob won't budge further."
