Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This price reflects its value while also allowing for a fair profit margin for you.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
