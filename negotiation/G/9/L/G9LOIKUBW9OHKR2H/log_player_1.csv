Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $125. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 125
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than your minimum allows room for negotiation or a quick sale at a profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150 gives you leverage. You don't have to go below your minimum. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  $125 is a strong opening offer. It's a 25% increase over Bob's perceived value, but still potentially attractive enough to him, especially if the ""limited time"" element adds pressure."
