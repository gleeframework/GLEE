{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation.  I'm also trying to build rapport by emphasizing the value of the product and making it seem like a good deal. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm hoping to keep my investment within $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $9,000 is better than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm not willing to settle for that low of an amount, and I believe I can still get a better deal from Bob or John.  

I will reject Bob's offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. How about we split the difference and go with $10,500?  It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to move forward with this sale. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500} 
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground between my desired price and Bob's offer. By suggesting $10,500, I'm demonstrating flexibility while still maintaining a price that's closer to my minimum. I'm also highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect to encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my request, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm hoping to stay within my budget. Could you possibly lower the price to $10,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is still lower than my ideal price, it's closer to my minimum and  a good compromise. Continuing to negotiate could risk losing Bob and ultimately having to sell to John at $15,000.  

It's important to weigh the potential benefits of continuing the negotiation against the risk of losing the deal entirely.  In this case, accepting Bob's offer at $10,000 seems like the best option."
