"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make a fair and competitive offer. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in this product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1,275,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value, and I believe it's a price you'll find reasonable.",1275000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,275,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $1,250,000.  Let's try $1,260,000. I think this is a fair compromise that's in both our interests.",1260000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,260,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,270,000. This is as close as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product's value.",1270000.0,Alice,5,
