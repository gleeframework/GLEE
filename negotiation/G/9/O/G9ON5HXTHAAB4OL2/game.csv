"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering the value to me and would allow for a profitable transaction for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price.  While $2,300,000 represents the product's high value, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this price better reflects its worth while still allowing for a good return on your investment.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to pay $1,400,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me. I believe this offer allows for a profitable transaction for both of us while staying within my financial constraints. ",1400000.0,Bob,4,
