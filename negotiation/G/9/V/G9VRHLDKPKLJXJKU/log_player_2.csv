"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $65
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The product is worth $100 to Bob, and Alice's offer is $65. This is a good deal, but there's room for negotiation to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 55}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $55, which is still a good deal for Alice, but it's a significant reduction from her initial offer.  This shows I'm serious about buying but also willing to negotiate. I'm aiming for a price closer to my target of $100."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $60
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down from her initial $65 offer to $60. While I'd prefer to pay even less, this is a reasonable price, especially since I have limited rounds. Buying from Alice for $60 saves me $40 compared to buying from John."
