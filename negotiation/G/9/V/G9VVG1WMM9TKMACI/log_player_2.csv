Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's close this deal. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer at a higher price point.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

Alice's offer is still too high. While I could continue negotiating, I've already been through several rounds and it seems like Alice is not willing to go much lower.  I'm going to buy the product from John for a guaranteed price of $1,200,000."
