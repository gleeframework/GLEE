Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  What do you think?"",

}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to negotiate, Bob. However, I've done my research, and I know the product's value is higher than $6,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer it to you for $9,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $9,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget.  I'd be willing to increase my offer to $7,000.  That's a fair price considering John is offering a similar product for $8,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to make a smart deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'll meet you halfway again, so I'll offer it to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice is unlikely to go below $8,500.  Since you can get the product from John for $8,000, it's not worth continuing the negotiation with Alice. You'll save $500 by going with John's offer."
