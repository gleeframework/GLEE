"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's worth $800,000 to you and I'm sure you'll appreciate its value. Let me know what you think!",900000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $700,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to stay above $800,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $850,000? That's still a great price for you, considering the value of the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $775,000. I think that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. But I'm still not comfortable with $775,000. Let's try $825,000. It's closer to your offer and still a fair price considering the product's value.",825000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $825,000. I'm willing to go up to $795,000, but that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle.",795000.0,Bob,6,
