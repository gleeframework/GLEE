Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer before I open it up to other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000, aiming slightly higher with Bob allows for a potential $150,000 extra profit.
* **Strategic Positioning:** The price is still significantly below Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), making it an attractive offer.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to decide quickly. 

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point.  We need to be prepared to potentially negotiate with Bob if he counters. However, we should remain firm on not going below our minimum ($1,200,000) since we have John as a guaranteed buyer."
