Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is way too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering it's a significant discount from your initial offer."",
""product_price"": 6000
}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your counter offer.  While I understand that my initial offer might have seemed high, $6,000 is quite a bit lower than I'm willing to go.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $11,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $11,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $7,000? That's a substantial increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my willingness to negotiate fairly."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $7,000 is still considerably below what I'm comfortable accepting. I'm willing to drop my price to $10,000, my absolute lowest price. This is a very fair offer considering the value you'll be getting. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her lowest price of $10,000. This is still higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and John's offer. It's unlikely Alice will go any lower, so it's best to cut your losses and buy from John to secure the best deal."
