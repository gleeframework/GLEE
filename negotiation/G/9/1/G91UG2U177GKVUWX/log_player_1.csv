"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product.  It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable.  My initial price is $1,400,000.  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm sure you'll agree this is a fair starting point."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, leaving room for negotiation but still aiming for a high price.
* **Positive Framing:** The message focuses on the value Bob will gain from the product, making him more likely to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but I'm not giving away the farm."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While $1,200,000 is better than nothing, I'm still hopeful I can negotiate a higher price with Bob.  I'm going to reject his offer and try to push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be realistic about the true value of this product.  $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but it shows I'm serious about finding a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintain a Firm Stance:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer but showing flexibility by lowering my price. However, it's still above his offer and closer to my desired range. 
* **Highlight Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth and emphasizing that my offer is still a good deal, considering its potential. 
* **Compromise Language:** Using terms like ""significant compromise"" conveys that I'm making an effort to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand the value of the product, I still believe we can reach a better agreement within my budget. I would like to propose a price of $1,250,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob has come up slightly, $1,250,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm not yet ready to sell to John, as I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob. I'll continue to explore options and try to push him closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value."", ""product_price"": 1325000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Splitting the Difference:**  This tactic often signals good faith and willingness to compromise, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Fair Price Emphasis:**  I'm still reminding Bob of the product's value, framing my offer as fair and reasonable.
* **Solution-Oriented:** My message focuses on finding a solution that works for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort in adjusting your offer. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our prices. I would like to propose a price of $1,300,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is the best we've seen so far, and it's getting closer to my desired price. It's still below my absolute minimum, but it's a reasonable compromise, and we're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. 

It's a risk, but with only 4 rounds left, the possibility of getting a better price from Bob decreases with each round. If I reject, there's a chance Bob might not come back with a higher counteroffer, and I might be forced to accept John's offer, which while higher, doesn't give me as much profit."
