"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to be realistic about the true value of this product.  $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect its potential.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a significant compromise on my part, but it shows I'm serious about finding a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,250,000 is still not quite where I need to be. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $1,325,000. This shows my commitment to finding a solution, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the product's value.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
