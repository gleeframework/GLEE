"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm sure you'll find it extremely valuable. My asking price is $11,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $11,500 is better than $12,000, there's room for negotiation, and Bob has 10 rounds to try and get a better price. It's worth seeing if Alice will come down in price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I'm looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to get closer to his target price of $10,000. This strategy is intended to show Alice that Bob is serious about buying the product but won't overpay. It also leaves room for negotiation in the remaining rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While $10,500 is closer to my bottom line, I'm still hoping for a bit more. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her original price, Bob is still determined to save as much as possible. He knows he has options and can still try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you want a little more, but I'm still not quite there.  How about $10,750?  It's a good compromise and gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is sticking to his goal of saving as much as possible while also demonstrating flexibility. He's increasing his offer slightly, showing willingness to meet Alice halfway.  This leaves room for further negotiation while still keeping him within his budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer.  While $10,750 is tempting, I'm still a bit away from my desired price. I'm willing to come down to $10,900.  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can finally close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still within his budget with Alice's offer of $10,900. However, he is only $100 away from his target price with John, and there are still 5 rounds left. It is worth continuing to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get the price down to his target. There's a good chance Alice will come down further to close the deal, and Bob doesn't want to miss out on that possibility."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're almost there!  I'm willing to go up to $10,800. It's a fair compromise, and I think we can finally close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is showing flexibility by increasing his offer, but he's also staying close to his target price. This demonstrates his seriousness about buying the product while still leaving room for Alice to negotiate. With only 4 rounds left, it's important to keep pushing for a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up. However, I'm still looking for something a little closer to $11,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $10,950. This is my final offer, and I hope we can agree. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,950. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,950
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's final offer of $10,950 is very close to Bob's target price, but he's only $50 away from securing the product from John. There are only three rounds left, and there's no guarantee that Alice will come down further.  It's too risky to gamble on further negotiation, especially with the potential to get the product for $10,000 right now."
