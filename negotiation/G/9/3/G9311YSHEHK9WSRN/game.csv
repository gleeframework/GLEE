"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps around $10000? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to ask. Thank you.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget.  While I can't go as low as $10000, I'm willing to come down to $10500 to make this work.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on this valuable product.  Let me know if this works for you!",10500.0,Alice,3,
