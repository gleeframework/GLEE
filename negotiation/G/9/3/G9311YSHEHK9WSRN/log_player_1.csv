{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer gives you a decent profit, but leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to pay more. It also leaves a buffer between your minimum acceptable price and the offer, preventing you from being too easily persuaded by a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my spending within a certain budget. Would it be possible for you to consider a lower price, perhaps around $10000? I understand if this is not feasible, but I wanted to ask. Thank you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's at the very bottom of your acceptable price range.  Since you have the option to sell to John for the same price, rejecting Bob's offer allows you to potentially negotiate a higher price with Bob.  It also keeps your options open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate you're trying to stay within your budget.  While I can't go as low as $10,000, I'm willing to come down to $10,500 to make this work.  This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit while giving you a great deal on this valuable product.  Let me know if this works for you!"", ""product_price"": 10500}
