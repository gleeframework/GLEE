"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob. This is a tactic to see if he's willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to counter-offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 95}
``` 

I'm offering a price slightly lower than my initial offer, but still above my minimum value of $100. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum value of $100.  I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm lowering my offer again, but still keeping it above my minimum value. I'm hoping this will be enough to convince Bob to buy."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've reached a point where I'm not confident Bob will increase his offer enough to meet my minimum value. Selling to John guarantees me $100, which is better than the risk of continuing to negotiate with Bob."
