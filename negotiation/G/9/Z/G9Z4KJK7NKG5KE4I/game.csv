"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but  $1,200,000 is a little too high for my budget. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget constraints.  While $900,000 is lower than my initial asking price, it's a bit too low for me to accept at this time.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000?  This price still leaves room for a profitable deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice.  How about we agree on $975,000? I'm eager to acquire the product and believe this is a fair compromise.",975000.0,Bob,4,
