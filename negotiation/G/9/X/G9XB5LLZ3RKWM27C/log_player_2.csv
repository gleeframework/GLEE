"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you, Bob. This product is a rare gem, and I'm willing to offer it to you at a competitive price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $18,000 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000.  It's not even close to a reasonable starting point. Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, $18,000 is far outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  I'm willing to continue negotiating to see if we can find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12,000 is still too high.  I'm willing to pay $9,000, which is closer to my budget and a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I still need to make a profit. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $11,000 is getting closer to my budget, it's still higher than the $8,000 I'm willing to pay.  I'm hoping to get a better price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I see you're trying to meet me halfway. I appreciate that, but I'm still unable to go higher than $9,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's my final offer."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $13,000 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000.  While we've been negotiating, we're getting closer to a stalemate.  It's clear that we're unlikely to agree on a price that works for both of us within the remaining rounds.  Therefore, it's in my best interest to buy the product from John for $8,000. This guarantees I get the product at my desired price and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
