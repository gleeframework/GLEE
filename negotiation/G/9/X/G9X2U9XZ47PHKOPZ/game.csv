"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it reflects my desire to make this deal work. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9,250 is still a little low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $9,375? This is a fair compromise, and it would allow us both to walk away happy. What do you think?",9375.0,Alice,5,,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not convinced that $9,375 is the right price. I'm willing to meet you at $9,300, but that's as low as I can go. Can you consider that?",9300.0,Bob,6,,
