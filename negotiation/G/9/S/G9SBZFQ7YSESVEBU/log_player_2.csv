**Reasoning:**

Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,325,000.  She keeps meeting in the middle, and her responses suggest she's firm on that price.  While we could try to push her further, it's getting risky. John's offer of $1,500,000 is a guaranteed way to get the product and only costs $160,000 more than Alice's current offer. At this point, the certainty is worth the price difference."
