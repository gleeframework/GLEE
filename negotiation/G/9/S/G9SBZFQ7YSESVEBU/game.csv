"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a fair price for the product. Let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,3,,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,350,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we try $1,100,000? I feel like that's a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not willing to go below $1,400,000. I'm willing to give you a slight discount, so I'm counteroffering at $1,350,000 is too low, but I can do $1,400,000 is too high, but I can do $1,380,000. This is my final compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable. Let me know if you're interested.",1380000.0,Alice,5,,
