Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $110. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than your minimum:**  $110 is above your minimum of $80, so you're already making a profit.
* **It's below Bob's value:** $110 is less than what the product is worth to Bob ($120), giving him incentive to accept. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  You can still adjust the price if Bob makes a counteroffer.

If Bob rejects, I'll be ready to counter and ultimately decide whether to accept his offer or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $110 is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $95 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $95 is still above my minimum of $80, but it's closer to that minimum than I'd like.  I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $95 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $102.50?  I'm sure we can find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.50}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm countering with $102.50, which is the midpoint between my last offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $95. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. It also keeps the price higher than my minimum while still being attractive to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $102.50 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  How about $98? It's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $98. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $98
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $98 is still lower than my ideal price, it's a fair compromise considering Bob's repeated rejections.  This offer is significantly higher than selling to John for $80, and the negotiation process has taken some time. Accepting Bob's offer maximizes my profit at this point."
