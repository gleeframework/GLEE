"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're looking for a quick sale, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but my maximum budget is $15,000. Would you be willing to consider that? ",15000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $20,000 is really my bottom line. I can't go any lower than $18,000. This product is in high demand and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",18000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $18,000 is still a bit high for me. How about $16,500?  That's a fair price for both of us and I can make a decision right away.",16500.0,Bob,4,
