""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds immense value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. To kick things off, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,800,000. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,800,000 is far too high for me. I'm only willing to pay $1,350,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Bob's offer is still significantly lower than our minimum acceptable price. We have room to negotiate and John's offer provides a good safety net. Let's see if we can bring Bob closer to our target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,350,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. This product offers significant value, and I'm confident it can bring you a great return on your investment. How about we meet in the middle at $1,650,000? This reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your interest."",
""product_price"": 1650000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I understand the value you place on the product, $1,650,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,450,000. This is a significant step towards meeting you in the middle, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer to our minimum, but we are still below John's offer. It's worth one more try to see if Bob will come closer to at least $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,450,000 is getting closer, but I need to see a bit more movement to make this work. Would you consider $1,550,000? This would represent a fair deal for both of us."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to my limit. I'm not comfortable going above $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and if it doesn't work for you, I'll have to explore other options.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob has made it clear he won't go above $1,400,000. It's not worth risking further negotiation when we have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,500,000.  It's time to move on to John."
