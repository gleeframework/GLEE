"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $750,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $700,000. This is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from the deal. Let me know your thoughts.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $725,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, while also giving me a reasonable profit margin. Let me know if this is something you're willing to consider.",725000.0,Alice,3,
