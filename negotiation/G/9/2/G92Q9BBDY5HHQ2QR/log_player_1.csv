Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to let it go for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you. Let me know your decision soon, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a substantial profit margin for Alice if Bob accepts.  The message also creates a sense of urgency (""other interested parties"") to encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Risk Mitigation:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have the safety net of selling to John at our desired price. 

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while minimizing the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
