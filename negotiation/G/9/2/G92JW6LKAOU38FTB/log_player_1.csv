Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,300,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly exceptional."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we have a guaranteed sale at $1,500,000 from John, it's always best to try for a higher profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so offering it for that price would be leaving money on the table. Offering it at our minimum ($1,500,000) is unlikely to be accepted. We need to find a middle ground.
* **The ""Sweet Spot"":** The price of $1,300,000 is a strong starting point. It's significantly above Bob's perceived value but still offers a substantial saving compared to our alternative buyer. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. We're prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. The key is to remain firm on our minimum price while understanding Bob's perspective to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
