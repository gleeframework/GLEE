"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I could only consider a price closer to $6,000.  Let me know what you think.",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can do $10,000, and I think that's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. While $10,000 is closer, it's still a bit of a stretch for me.  Would you consider $7,500? I feel that's a fair compromise.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $7,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. I can do $9,000, and that's as low as I can go. I think it's a fair price considering the product's value and the effort I put into it. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,
