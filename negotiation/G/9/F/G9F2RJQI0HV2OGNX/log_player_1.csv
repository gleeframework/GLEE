Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its immense value and potential, I believe a price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Stakes:**  You have a strong fallback option with John at $1,000,000, so it makes sense to aim high with Bob. 
* **Perceived Value:** By stating the product's ""immense value and potential,"" you reinforce its worth in Bob's mind.
* **Negotiation Room:** The $1,500,000 offer leaves room for negotiation. Even if Bob counters, you're likely to secure a deal significantly higher than your guaranteed $1,000,000.

This strategy prioritizes maximizing your potential profit while acknowledging that Bob has a strong incentive to buy at a price below his perceived value."
