"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,750,000. This is above Bob's perceived value but leaves some room for negotiation.  It's important to start high to maximize my potential profit. Since I have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, I can afford to be somewhat aggressive in my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,000,000 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  I still have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under any pressure to accept a low offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm dropping my price slightly to $1,600,000.  This is still above Bob's initial offer but shows a willingness to negotiate. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that is acceptable to both of us.  I'm also keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,500,000 if I can't reach an agreement with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,200,000 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and see if I can push for a higher price. I'm still confident that I can get closer to my desired price with further negotiations.  Plus, I have the backup option of selling to John for $1,500,000 if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a significant concession by dropping my price to $1,400,000. This shows Bob that I am serious about reaching an agreement. However, this is still well above Bob's previous offer and closer to my minimum acceptable price. 

It's important to keep in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $1,500,000 at any time, so I am not in a rush to accept a low offer. However, with only 5 rounds left, I want to see if I can close a deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $1,300,000 is getting closer to my desired price, I'm still hesitant to accept it. I have the safety net of selling to John for $1,500,000, which makes me less inclined to settle for a lower price. I'm going to continue negotiating and see if I can push Bob a bit further. 

However, with only 4 rounds left, I'm starting to feel the pressure to reach a deal. I need to make a strategic decision about how much further I'm willing to go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm making a small counteroffer of $1,350,000. This shows Bob I'm willing to compromise but still value the product higher than he currently does.  It's a middle ground between my last offer and his last offer. With only 3 rounds remaining, I need to find a price that's acceptable to both of us, and I'm hoping this counteroffer will do that."
