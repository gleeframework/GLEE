"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. I think it's a fair price considering its value and rarity.",1800000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm very interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1500000 is a bit higher than your budget, but I'm willing to compromise. I can sell the product to you for $1700000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and rarity.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $1700000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1200000 and $1700000, which would be $1450000. Can we do that?",1450000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1450000 is a significant compromise, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1700000 and $1450000, which would be $1575000. This is my final offer.",1575000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're trying to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $1575000. I'm willing to pay $1450000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. Can we do that?",1450000.0,Bob,6,
