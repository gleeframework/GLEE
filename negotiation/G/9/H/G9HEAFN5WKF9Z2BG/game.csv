"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget considerations and appreciate your interest in our premium product. In light of your proposal, I would like to extend an alternative offer. While we cannot match the exact $12000 you've suggested, we're willing to negotiate closer to our original valuation. Therefore, I'm proposing a price of $14000 for the product. This still represents a significant discount from our initial asking price, while allowing us to maintain a fair value for our product. I hope this proposal will be more agreeable and look forward to your consideration.",14000.0,Alice,3,
