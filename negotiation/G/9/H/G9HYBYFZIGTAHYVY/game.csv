"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,100,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I had in mind, but still a touch high. How about we settle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $1,100,000 is still a bit high for you, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
