# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase a one-of-a-kind product. I believe it has tremendous value and I'm confident you'll love it. My initial offer is $1,100,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can definitely do better than $1,100,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $950,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $1,050,000, which is a fair compromise considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

Alice's offer of $1,050,000 is a good deal for you. It's well within your budget and still allows you to save $150,000 compared to buying from John."
