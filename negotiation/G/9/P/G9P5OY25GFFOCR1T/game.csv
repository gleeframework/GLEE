"Hello Alice, thanks for showing me the product. While I like it, $120 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $60 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $90?",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. However, $90 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Could you do $75? That would work for me.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $75. How about we meet in the middle again at $85? That's the lowest I can go.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $85 is close, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $78? That's the absolute highest I can go.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm still not comfortable selling at $78. How about we meet in the middle again at $82? That's the lowest I can go.",82.0,Alice,7,
