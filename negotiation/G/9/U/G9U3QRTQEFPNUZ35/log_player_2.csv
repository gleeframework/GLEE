"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a competitive price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Even though Alice's offer is lower than John's price, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($1,200,000).  You can potentially negotiate a better price with Alice by rejecting her offer.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can potentially get a lower price from Alice or simply buy from John if a better price isn't possible."
