"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, but I'm open to negotiations. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is a good starting point, but it's still significantly higher than what the product is worth to me. There's room for negotiation, and I want to explore that possibility before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value of the product, $800,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the potential benefits. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $600,000 to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $700,000. This is a compromise that I believe will benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down in price, $700,000 is still more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get closer to my target price. There's still room for a compromise, and I want to explore that before going with John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $700,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm sticking to my previous offer of $600,000.  This is a fair price considering the potential benefits, and I'm confident that we can both walk away satisfied with this deal."", ""product_price"": 600000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $600,000 is a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $650,000. This is the minimum I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $650,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $650,000, which is getting closer to my target price. At this point, I'm feeling the pressure to make a decision as the negotiations are moving towards the end.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of Alice rejecting my counteroffer or running out of rounds is high. It's better to secure the deal at a price that's within my budget rather than risk losing the product entirely. Buying from John at $1,000,000 is not an option as it is significantly more expensive."
