"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm willing to pay up to $150, I'm going to try and negotiate with Alice to see if I can get a better price.  There's no harm in trying to get a lower price, and I still have the option to buy from John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 120} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully find a price that's closer to my target.  I'm hoping Alice will see the value in closing the deal and accepting a slightly lower price rather than risk me going to John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $135, which is still within my budget and a good deal compared to John's price.  It's not the absolute lowest I'd like to pay, but I'm confident that further negotiation might not get me a much lower price. It's better to accept and save myself further rounds of negotiation."
