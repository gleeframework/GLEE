Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll receive. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've set your minimum at $800,000, so this offer leaves you room to negotiate.
* **It's below Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $1,500,000, giving him an incentive to negotiate.
* **It shows you're serious:**  It's not an insulting lowball offer, demonstrating that you're willing to negotiate fairly.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still ensuring a deal. This offer gives you a good starting point and leaves you flexibility to adjust based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a little high for me.  Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is still above your minimum, it's a significant drop from your initial offer and closer to John's offer. It's worth trying to push for a higher price. You can counter with a price closer to your initial offer, but be prepared to adjust if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm prepared to come down to $1,050,000. This price still reflects the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  I could meet you halfway between our offers at $975,000.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's in your best interest to accept Bob's offer.  You're already well above your minimum price of $800,000, and further negotiation could risk losing the deal altogether.  Bob's offer is a good compromise, and it's likely that any further counteroffers will be met with resistance.  It's better to secure a solid profit now rather than risk getting stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John."
