"Alice's offer: The product price will be $999,999. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $999,999
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's a good deal, and there's no reason to risk losing the product by continuing to negotiate or buying from John at a higher price."
