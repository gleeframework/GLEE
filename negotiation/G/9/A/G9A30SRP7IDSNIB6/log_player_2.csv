Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $925,000 is very close to my ideal price.  Considering there are only 5 rounds left, it's likely I won't get a better deal.  It's also worth noting that the product is valued at $1,200,000 to me, so I'm still getting a good deal even at $925,000.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product and avoid the risk of having to buy from John at a higher price."
