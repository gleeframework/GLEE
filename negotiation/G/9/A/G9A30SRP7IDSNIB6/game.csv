"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I see the value in the product, $900,000 is a bit high for me at this moment. I'm willing to offer you $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $950,000 is still a bit out of my range right now.  I'm willing to offer $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the value to both of us.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,000,000. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
