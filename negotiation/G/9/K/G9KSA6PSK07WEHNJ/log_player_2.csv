"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $10,500. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's true value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're willing to go up to $10,000, but I'm not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'll offer it to you for $10,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should buy the product from John for $10,000. While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's maximum budget. Buying from John allows him to acquire the product within his budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice."
