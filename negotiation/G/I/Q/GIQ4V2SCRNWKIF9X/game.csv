"Alice, while I appreciate your offer,  $1,100,000 is still higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product. This represents a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the potential benefits. ",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $900,000 is a respectable offer, the true value of this product is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. I believe this revised price reflects a fair compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,050,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm willing to go to $950,000.  This is a significant investment for me, but it's the highest I can reasonably offer.  I hope you'll consider this compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position and I'm motivated to find a solution that works for both of us. However, the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,000,000. This is a considerable concession on my end, reflecting my hope to conclude this deal.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
