"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product I think you'll love! I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($120) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Room for negotiation:**  $150 is a good starting point that allows for several rounds of negotiation before I reach my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a lower price? I'm thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:**  Bob has offered my minimum acceptable price ($120). 
* **No reason to risk further negotiation:** There's no guarantee I'll get a better price, and I risk losing the deal entirely. 
* **Time is a factor:** I have limited rounds, and accepting this offer ensures a sale in this round."
