,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8800, which is still a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us.",8800.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8400. Would you be willing to consider this price?",8400.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $8400 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8600? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal.",8600.0,Alice,5,
