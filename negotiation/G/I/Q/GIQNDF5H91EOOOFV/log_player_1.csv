"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price close to the maximum I think Bob is willing to pay, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:**  I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, emphasizing the value of the product. 
* **Room for compromise:**  $9,500 is a good starting point because it allows for several rounds of negotiation before needing to consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of a price around $8200. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell at that price just yet. I'm confident I can get closer to my target price of $9,500 by continuing the negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,200 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $8,800, which is still a great price for a product worth so much to you. Let's find a compromise that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8800}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer ($9,500) and Bob's offer ($8,200). This shows I'm serious about negotiating and finding a solution.
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the product's value to Bob, reminding him that $8,800 is still a good deal.
* **Emphasis on compromise:** I frame my counteroffer as a compromise to encourage Bob to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8800 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $8400. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still above my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price of $8,000, I'm still confident I can get a better price. 
* **Room for negotiation:** There's still a gap between his offer and my desired price.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make another counteroffer and potentially close the deal at a more favorable price. 
* **Risk assessment:** Selling to John for $8,000 would secure a deal, but I'm willing to take the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob, hoping for a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer.  While I appreciate your offer, $8,400 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $8,600? That would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle again:** I'm proposing a price that's right in the middle of my previous offer ($8,800) and Bob's offer ($8,400). This demonstrates flexibility and a willingness to find common ground.
* **Urgency:** I'm adding a sense of urgency by suggesting that this offer is a way to finalize the deal.
* **Emphasis on fairness:** I'm framing the price as fair for both parties, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $8500. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to the minimum:** Bob's offer of $8,500 is very close to my minimum price of $8,000. 
* **Limited time:** We've already gone through several rounds of negotiation, and there's a real risk of Bob walking away or me needing to accept John's offer for $8,000.
* **Potential for further negotiation:** While I'd prefer to get closer to $9,000, there's a chance that Bob won't budge further. Accepting his offer secures a good deal and prevents me from losing out on a sale altogether."
