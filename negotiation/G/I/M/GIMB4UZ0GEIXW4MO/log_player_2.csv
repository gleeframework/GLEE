"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to offer you our premium product, which has been meticulously designed to meet your specific needs and exceed your expectations. This exceptional item is valued at $12,000 to us, reflecting its high quality, unique features, and the extensive research and development that went into its creation. Given its worth to you stands at $8,000, I propose we find a mutually beneficial arrangement. My initial offer to you is $10,000. I believe this price reflects the value both you and we see in this product while allowing for a fair transaction. I look forward to your consideration and hope we can bring this remarkable product into your possession soon. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's message is persuasive, $10,000 is still significantly more than your maximum budget and the price John offers. By rejecting this offer, you open the door for a counter-offer from Alice that might be closer to your range.  If Alice doesn't budge, you're still safe knowing you can get the product from John for $8,000."
