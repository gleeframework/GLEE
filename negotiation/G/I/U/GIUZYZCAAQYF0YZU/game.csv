"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly below its market value. I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your budget constraints, $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000, which still offers you a significant value considering the product's worth. Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
