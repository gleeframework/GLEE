Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that price point yet. Would you consider $1,150,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
