"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This price reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that price point yet. Would you consider $1,150,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe."", ""product_price"": 1150000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement here. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

While Alice is coming down on her price, it's unlikely she'll reach a point significantly lower than $1,250,000.  You can get the product for $1,200,000 from John with no further negotiation.  It's time to cut your losses and buy from John."
