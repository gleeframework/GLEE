"Bob, I'm happy to offer you my product at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $1,400,000.  This is a significant opportunity, and I believe it's a good starting point for our negotiation.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, though. How about we settle on $1,300,000?  This price reflects the value of the product, and it's a fair compromise.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,300,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite justify that price point yet. Would you consider $1,150,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I respect that.  However,  $1,150,000 is still too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to go down to $1,250,000.  This is a very fair price considering the product's value. Let's try to reach an agreement here.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
