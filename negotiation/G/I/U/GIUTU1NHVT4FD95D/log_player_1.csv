"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly valuable to you, potentially even more so than to me. To start the conversation, I'm offering it for $1,150,000."",
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm aiming for a high initial offer, closer to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) than my minimum ($1,000,000). 
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  This high starting point gives us space to negotiate and allows me to appear flexible in later rounds.
* **Conveying Value:** My message subtly highlights the product's worth to Bob, aiming to anchor his thinking around a higher value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,080,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,080,000 is above my minimum, it's still a significant distance from my initial ask and potentially leaves a lot of money on the table. I believe I have leverage to negotiate further given:

* **Product Value:**  The product is worth considerably more to Bob than to me.
* **Rounds Remaining:** We have plenty of rounds left, so there's no need to settle quickly.

I'll reject Bob's offer and aim for a counteroffer closer to $1,100,000 in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. However, the value of this product is truly significant, and $1,080,000 undervalues its potential.  Would you consider $1,120,000? I'm confident this price reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1120000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer  meets Bob halfway between his offer ($1,080,000) and my previous ask ($1,150,000). 
* **Maintaining Firmness:**  While moving closer to Bob's price, I'm maintaining a firm stance that the product is worth more than his initial offer.
* **Positive Framing:** My message emphasizes fairness and mutual benefit, aiming for a collaborative negotiation rather than a combative one."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand that you think the product is valuable, but I'm still not convinced that $1,120,000 is the right price. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,080,000, but I'd like to propose a compromise: $1,100,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strong Offer:** Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is a significant profit above my minimum price ($1,000,000).
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob's use of the phrase ""final offer"" suggests he's serious and unlikely to go much higher.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I might be able to squeeze out a bit more in further rounds, there's a risk Bob will walk away, leaving me to accept the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John. 

It's a good deal on the table, and accepting now avoids the potential for losing a significant amount."
