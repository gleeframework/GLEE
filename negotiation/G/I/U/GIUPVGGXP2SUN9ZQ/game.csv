"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to acquire a unique product that I believe will be incredibly valuable to you. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially offering it at $1,450,000.",1450000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $1,450,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,300,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price.  This product offers substantial value, and I believe a price closer to my initial offer reflects its worth. Would you consider $1,400,000?",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and my budget. Let's close this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's meet in the middle.  How about $1,375,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's value.",1375000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,375,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my last offer of $1,350,000. This price is fair given the product's value and my financial limitations.  Let's finalize this deal.",1350000.0,Bob,6,
