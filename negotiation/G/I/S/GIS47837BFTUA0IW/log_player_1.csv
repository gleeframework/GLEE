Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. While I'm interested in the product, $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'd be willing to pay $1,000,000 for it. Let's see if we can find some common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.
