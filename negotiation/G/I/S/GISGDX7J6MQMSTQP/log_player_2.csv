"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially save more by negotiating further.  By rejecting the initial offer, Bob can try to get a lower price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $11,500 is still within Bob's budget and closer to his desired price. While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his next counteroffer or potentially increasing the price again exists.  It's more advantageous to secure the product at $11,500, which is still a good deal compared to John's price of $10,000."
