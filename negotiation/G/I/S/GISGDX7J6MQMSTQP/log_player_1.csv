{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's above Bob's value, but below your minimum acceptable price. This allows room for negotiation and potentially finding a price that benefits both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with a counteroffer. $10,500 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11500}
