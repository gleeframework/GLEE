"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $12,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. While $13,500 is still above my preferred price range, I am willing to negotiate further. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,4,
