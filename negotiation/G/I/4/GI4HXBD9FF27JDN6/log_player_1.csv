Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's:

* **Above Bob's perceived value:** It leaves some room for negotiation while still giving you a profit. 
* **Below your minimum:** It shows you are willing to negotiate.
* **Leaves room for counteroffers:**  You can adjust your price based on Bob's response. 

Remember, you can always go to John for $15,000 if you're not satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I am looking to keep my expenses within a certain budget. Would you be open to discussing a lower price? I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum threshold of $15,000. I'm going to try and get closer to my desired price by counteroffering Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to work with, but $12,000 just doesn't cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. This is a one-time offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 13500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer attempts to find a middle ground between my minimum price and Bob's offer. It:

* **Shows flexibility:** Demonstrates I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Keeps the price above my minimum:** Still allows me to make a decent profit.
* **Sets a deadline:**  Adds pressure for Bob to decide. 

Let's see if this counteroffer convinces Bob to close the deal!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for considering my budget constraints. While $13,500 is still above my preferred price range, I am willing to negotiate further. Could we possibly agree on a price closer to $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher than $12,000, which is below my minimum acceptable price. While I could keep negotiating, there's a risk that this could go on indefinitely and I might end up with a price that's too low. 

John is guaranteed to buy the product for $15,000, which is the best deal I can get right now. Selling to John allows me to guarantee my desired profit and avoid further time-consuming negotiations with Bob."
