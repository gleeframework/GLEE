Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a point where you're aiming for a good profit, but still leave room for bargaining.  It also sets the tone that you are confident in the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. Would you be willing to meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is higher than what John would pay, it's still significantly lower than what the product is worth to you. You can likely negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $900,000? That's still a great price for you, and a fair deal for me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $850,000. How about we meet in the middle at $875,000? That way, I can get a good deal and you can still make a profit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $875,000 isn't ideal, it's still a decent profit and a much better deal than selling to John.  There's always the risk that Bob might reject your next counteroffer, and it's not worth risking losing out on a good sale."
