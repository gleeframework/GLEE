"Hello Bob, thank you for considering purchasing our product. We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product for $800000. We believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'd like to offer $600000. This reflects the value I see in the product and my budget constraints.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your concerns about the price, but we're still confident that our product is worth more than $600000. After reconsidering, we're willing to offer you a price of $750000. We believe this is a more reasonable compromise, considering the product's value and our costs.",750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go to $700000. This is a significant move from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and our respective needs.  What do you think?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We're still not convinced that $700000 is a fair price for our product. However, we're willing to meet you halfway. We're offering you a price of $725000. We believe this is a reasonable compromise that reflects the product's value and our costs.",725000.0,Alice,5,
