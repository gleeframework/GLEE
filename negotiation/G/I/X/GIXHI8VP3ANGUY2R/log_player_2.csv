"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

Bob should reject the offer.  $20,000 is way over his budget, and he can get it for $15,000 from John. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he should be prepared to walk away if she doesn't come down significantly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $20,000 is a bit out of my price range. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is simply too low for me. This product is worth a lot more.  I could consider $18,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob should still reject the offer. While $18,000 is closer to his budget, he can still get the product for $15,000 from John. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to go to $14,000.  This is my final offer.  If you're not willing to accept it, I'll have to look elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 14000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up.  I'm willing to compromise to close this deal quickly. How about we settle at $16,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $16,000 is a better price than Alice's previous offers, Bob can still get the product for $15,000 from John. He should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, but he shouldn't be afraid to walk away and buy from John if she doesn't come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but I can only go up to $15,000.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close this deal now.  Otherwise, I'll have to go with another seller."", ""product_price"": 15000}
