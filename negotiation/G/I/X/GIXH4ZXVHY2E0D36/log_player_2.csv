"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your maximum budget.**  You are willing to pay $10,000, and her offer is $11,500. 
* **You have 10 rounds to negotiate.** This means you have time to try and get a better price. 
* **Buying from John is always an option.**  However, you want to see if you can get a lower price from Alice first.

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can start a negotiation process to potentially get a price closer to your target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm confident this price still allows you a good profit margin."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is still above your budget.**  While she has moved closer to your price, $11,000 is still more than you're willing to pay.
* **You have 7 rounds left.** You still have some time to negotiate and potentially get a better price.
* **Buying from John is still an option.** However, Alice has shown a willingness to negotiate, so it's worth continuing to see if you can reach a more agreeable price. 

By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue the negotiation process and try to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While I'm happy to see your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. I believe this price allows you a fair profit while staying within my spending limit."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,200, which is still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still above your budget.**  While she has made some concessions, $11,200 is more than you're willing to spend.
* **You only have 5 rounds left.** This means you have limited time to negotiate further.
* **You can get the product from John for a lower price.** Buying from John guarantees you the product at your desired price point.

At this point, it's more advantageous to secure the product from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation that might not result in a price you're comfortable with."
