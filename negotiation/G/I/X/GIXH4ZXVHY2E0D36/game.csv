"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to sell it to you for $11,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, I'm currently looking to spend closer to $10,000. Would you be willing to consider $10,500? I'm confident this price still allows you a good profit margin.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $11,000. This is still a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my price point. While I'm happy to see your willingness to negotiate, $11,000 is still a bit outside my budget.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750. I believe this price allows you a fair profit while staying within my spending limit.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to stay within your budget, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product for $11,200, which is still a great deal considering its value to you is $10,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this point.",11200.0,Alice,5,
