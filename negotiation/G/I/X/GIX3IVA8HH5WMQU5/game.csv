"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you.  To start the conversation, I'm offering it at $2,300,000.",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer, but $2,300,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This reflects the maximum value I can see in the product for my business. ",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your honesty and directness.  I understand your perspective, but $800,000 is considerably below its true market value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant price adjustment, and I believe it represents a fair offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still far beyond my budget.  I understand the product's value to you, but my maximum offer remains at $1,000,000. This is a significant increase from my initial offer and reflects my genuine interest in acquiring this product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand your position, the product's value is significantly higher than your current offer. To meet you closer to your range, I'm proposing $1,750,000. I feel this is a fair price that reflects the product's true worth.",1750000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your perspective, and I'm glad we're getting closer.  However, $1,750,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,250,000. This represents a significant step for me, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,6,
