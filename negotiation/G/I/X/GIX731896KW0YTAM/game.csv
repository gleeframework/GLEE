"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is significantly lower than what I'm aiming for. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? It's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget, but $750,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to go up to $700,000. That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
