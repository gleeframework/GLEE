"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, I'm currently looking to spend no more than $750,000. Would you be willing to consider that price?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking to stay within a budget of $750,000, Bob, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $825,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer. I'm confident you'll find it's a fair price for this exceptional product.",825000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $775,000. This represents a substantial discount for you and a good deal for me.  What do you think?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a mutually beneficial agreement. However, I'm still looking to maximize my profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. This price reflects the value I believe the product holds, while also acknowledging your budget constraints.",795000.0,Alice,5,
