Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at the special price of $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $150, I want to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below my guaranteed price creates a sense of urgency and value for Bob.  It's unlikely he'll pay significantly more than his perceived value ($80), so I need to stay within a reasonable range of my minimum.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring I don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
