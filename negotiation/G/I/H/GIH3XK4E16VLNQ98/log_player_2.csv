"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you might be interested in. It's something that's worth $150 to you, and I'm willing to sell it for $135.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice's offer of $135 is tempting, you know you can get the product for $150 from John. There's a chance Alice might lower her price in a counter-offer, saving you even more money."
