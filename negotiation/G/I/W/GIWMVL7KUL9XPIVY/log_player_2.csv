"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to sell you this great product, and I think you'll really love it! Would you like to make an offer on it? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is higher than your maximum price and leaves little room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if you can get her price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** This counteroffer is a bit below Alice's valuation ($80). It leaves room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant discount. 
* **Polite and Open:** The message is friendly and expresses continued interest, encouraging Alice to continue the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but I'm not sure I can go as low as $70. I can do $85, which is the lowest I can go, and still make it worth my while. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:** $85 is a solid price, well below your $100 maximum and only slightly above Alice's valuation. 
* **Limited Upside:**  Continuing to negotiate might get the price down a few more dollars, but the potential savings are small compared to the risk of Alice walking away.
* **John is Not a Better Alternative:** At this point, accepting Alice's offer saves you $15 compared to buying from John."
