"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe would be a great asset to you.  Given its value, I'm offering it at $13,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is quite high considering her product's value to her. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  While aiming for a price closer to $8,000, starting with a lower counter-offer leaves room for negotiation and signals that we're looking for a significant discount. 
* **Justification:** Suggesting a middle ground makes the offer seem more reasonable and encourages Alice to engage in the bargaining process."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest, Bob. While $10,000 is a tempting offer, the value of this product is considerably higher.  I could consider letting it go for $12,000. This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bluff Called:** Alice claiming this is her final offer at this stage is likely a negotiating tactic. It's too early to accept, especially as we're still significantly above her value. 
* **Room for Movement:**  The price difference is still substantial.  We can afford to push back a bit more and see if she's willing to budge further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand the product's value, Alice, but $12,000 is still pushing my budget. I'd be willing to offer $10,500. That's a fair compromise, don't you think?"",
""product_price"": 10500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental Increase:** We're increasing our offer slightly to show Alice we're willing to negotiate, but not by a large amount. This keeps the pressure on her.
* **Justification:** By presenting our offer as a fair compromise, we're maintaining a collaborative tone while still advocating for a better price.  
* **Alternative in Mind:** We're getting closer to John's price, so we'll need to consider if further negotiation with Alice is worthwhile or if we should switch to our backup option soon."
