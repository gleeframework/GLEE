"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,200,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would still give you a healthy profit, and I'd be happy to close the deal. What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This still gives you a very good deal, and we can close this quickly. Let me know if you're interested.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
