Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $110 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I appreciate you taking the time to consider it. While I'm eager to find a good home for the product, $110 is a bit lower than I'd be comfortable with. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $130?"", 
""product_price"": 130

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $115.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

While a deal with Bob is still possible, his offer is creeping up very slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach my minimum price of $120, and John offers a guaranteed sale at that amount. It's time to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the sure thing."
