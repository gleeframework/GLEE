"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I have to consider my own valuation of the product, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $1050000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise, considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I have to think about the value of the product to me, and I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm now offering the product to you for $1025000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
