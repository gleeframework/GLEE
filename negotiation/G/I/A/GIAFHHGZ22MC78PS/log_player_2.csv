# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our flagship product, which I believe would significantly enhance the value and functionality of your operations. Given its exceptional quality and capabilities, this product is truly worth more than $15,000 to you. Considering its immense value to you and the cost involved in acquiring it, I am offering it to you for $12,000. This represents a significant saving for you compared to the market value, while still allowing me to recover a substantial portion of my investment. I look forward to hearing your decision soon. Kind regards, Alice
