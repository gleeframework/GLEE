Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob, knowing you have a guaranteed sale at $120 with John.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While $119 is just below your minimum, it leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's really interested.
* **Appear Reasonable:**  Starting too high might discourage Bob immediately. Offering a price slightly below your minimum makes it seem like you're already giving him a good deal. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how much he might be willing to pay above his perceived value."
