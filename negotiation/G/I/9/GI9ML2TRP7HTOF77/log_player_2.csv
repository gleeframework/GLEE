"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a product that's worth a significant amount to you. I'm confident this product will be highly valuable to your operations.  My asking price is $1,450,000, which leaves room for both of us to benefit from this transaction.  Please consider this offer carefully.  If you decline, I have another buyer lined up, but I believe this product would be a better fit for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

Alice's offer of $1,450,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000 and it's cheaper than buying from John."
