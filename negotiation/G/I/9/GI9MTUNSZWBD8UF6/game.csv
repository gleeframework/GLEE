"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its incredible potential, I'm asking for $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations.",1000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,000,000 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $750,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. This product offers exceptional value, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?",925000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $925,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'd like to counter with $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",800000.0,Bob,4,
