"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $950000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $850000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering you a counteroffer of $900000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value and rarity. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $900000. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $880000. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",880000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $880000. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my original price. I'm offering you a final counteroffer of $920000. This is the best I can do, and I hope you'll consider it. What do you think?",920000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your final counteroffer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to make one more concession. However, I'm still not comfortable going up to $920000. I'd like to make one more counteroffer of $890000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations we've had so far. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $800000.",890000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $890000. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to get closer to my original price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to get to $910000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider selling the product to John for $1000000. What do you think?",910000.0,Alice,7,
