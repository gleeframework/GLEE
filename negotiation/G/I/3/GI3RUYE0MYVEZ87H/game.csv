"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob,  $1,050,000 is a good starting point, but we're still a bit apart. I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000,  which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  However, $1,075,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to go up to $1,060,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach a deal at this price.",1060000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,060,000 still doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,065,000. This is a final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair compromise. Let's close this deal.",1065000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but $1,065,000 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $1,060,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable to you. I hope you'll reconsider.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
