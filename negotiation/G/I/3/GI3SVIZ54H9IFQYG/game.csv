"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $13,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $12,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to sell it for. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $11,250? That feels like a fair compromise.",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I like that you're willing to compromise, Bob. However, $11,250 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $12,500?",12500.0,Alice,5,
