"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

It's better to try and get a lower price from Alice.  $6,000 is a good starting point, but we can likely get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4000}
```

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer of $4,000. This shows Alice that I'm serious about getting a good deal and hopefully encourages her to come down from her initial price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Alice has moved closer to my counteroffer. It's worth trying to push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 4500}
```

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $4,500. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise while still trying to secure a good price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $5,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $5,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Alice's offer of $5,500 is a good deal, considering I have a backup option of buying from John for $10,000. There's a risk that I might be able to get a lower price, but there's also a chance that Alice will reject my counteroffer, and I'll lose out on a good deal.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
