"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,100,000. I believe this product has great potential, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider meeting me at this price?",1100000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still a bit below my target. How about we split the difference at $1,150,000? This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to secure a fair price for the product. Let's find common ground and finalize this deal.",1150000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,150,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,075,000. Can you consider this price? I'm really interested in the product, and I'm willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $1,075,000 is a little too low for me, but I'm willing to move a bit closer. How about we settle at $1,125,000? This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal. What do you say?",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that we're getting close, Alice. However, $1,125,000 is still a bit above my target. I'm willing to go up to $1,100,000, but no higher. Can you consider this price? I'm really interested in the product and I'm willing to work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
