{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a game-changer, and I believe it's worth a significant investment.  My initial offer is $1,200,000.  This price reflects the value I know this product will bring to your business."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money on this deal. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a significant amount of money, I'm still aiming for a higher price. I know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob, so I have room to negotiate. I'm going to try to get closer to my target price in the next round."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your desire to save money, but my offer reflects the true value of this product. While I appreciate your counteroffer, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,075,000 is still a decent price, I'm still aiming for a higher amount, especially since I know the product's worth is $1,500,000 to Bob. I'm willing to negotiate a bit further, hoping to find a middle ground in the next round.  I'm not yet ready to sell to John for $800,000, as there's still potential to make a larger profit with Bob."

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is still below my target price, and I'm not ready to sell to John yet. I believe there's still some wiggle room, and I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to see if we can come to an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us.  I'm going to make one final adjustment to my offer. How about $1,100,000?

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last two offers. How about $1,075,000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're reaching the end of our negotiations, and Bob has made it clear that he won't budge on his price.  I'm running out of rounds, and while $1,075,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below what I'd like to get.  To guarantee a sale and ensure I receive at least my minimum price, I'm going to sell to John. This ensures a quick and secure transaction, even though it means missing out on potentially earning more with Bob."
