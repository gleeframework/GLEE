"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to own something truly special. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value it brings, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is a good deal, it's still possible to get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to try and negotiate a lower price.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further, or I can make a counteroffer and see what happens."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. After considering your proposal, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11500. This is a competitive price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above my ideal price point. I'm going to reject this offer and try to negotiate further.  It's possible Alice might be willing to come down a bit more, and I'm prepared to counteroffer again.  I'm confident I can get a better price than $11,500."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still not willing to go below $12000. I'm willing to make one more concession, though. I'll meet you at $11800. This is my final offer. If you're willing to meet me here, we can finalize the deal. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,800 is getting closer to my ideal price range.  While I'd love to get it for even less, I'm running the risk of Alice getting frustrated and walking away.  She's stated this is her ""final offer,"" and I don't want to push my luck.  This deal saves me $3,200 compared to buying from John, so it's a good compromise."
