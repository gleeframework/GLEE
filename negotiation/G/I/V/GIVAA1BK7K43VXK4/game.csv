"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $1800000. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else. What do you think?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob, but $1200000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $1600000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1600000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1400000. Can you meet me at this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1400000 is still a bit of a stretch for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to compromise further. I can offer you a price of $1600000, but I'll throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. How about we add a premium service package worth $200000, which would bring the total value to $1800000? But I'll give you a discount and sell it to you for $1500000. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not interested in the premium service package, and I'm still not willing to pay $1500000. I'll meet you halfway on the price, but I'm only willing to pay $1300000. Can you accept this price?",1300000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway on the price, but I need to make a profit. I can offer you the product for $1500000, which is the midpoint between our previous offers. It's a fair price, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get the product at a good value. What do you think?",1500000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to pay $1500000. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you accept this price?",1200000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one last offer, and I'll meet you at $1200000, but I need you to throw in a commitment to purchase a related product from me within the next 6 months. This will ensure that I get a good return on my investment. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I'm still not willing to commit to purchasing a related product from you in the future. I'm willing to meet you at $1200000, but I need you to accept this price without any additional conditions. This is my final offer.",1200000.0,Bob,10,
