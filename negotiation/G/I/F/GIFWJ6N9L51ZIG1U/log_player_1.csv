Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. This is a unique item, and I'm confident it would be a valuable asset to you."",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since I know the product's value to Bob ($10,000) and my minimum acceptable price ($10,000), I want to aim higher to maximize potential profit.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $15,000 allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping me above my minimum.
* **Highlight Value:** The message emphasizes the product's worth and uniqueness to justify the higher price.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject the offer. However, having John as a backup buyer ensures I won't be forced to sell below my minimum price."
