Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,200,000. It's a valuable asset that's worth a great deal to you. I believe this price reflects its true worth and provides us both with a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,200,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the potential benefits it offers. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While $800,000 is a significant amount of money, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't accept $800,000. It's significantly below the value of the product.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000? This price reflects the product's worth and ensures a mutually beneficial deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
