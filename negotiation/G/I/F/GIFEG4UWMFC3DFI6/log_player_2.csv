"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own something truly unique. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll love it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

While $800,000 is a decent price, there's room for negotiation. It's worth seeing if Alice is willing to go lower."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $600,000 is a significant discount, but I'm afraid I can't quite meet you there. However, I'm willing to compromise and offer you the product for $750,000. This is a one-time offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but there's still room for negotiation. We'll try pushing a little further."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I understand that $675,000 is a reasonable compromise, but I'm still not willing to let the product go for that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $725,000.

This is a good deal. Alice is firm on her price, and while we might be able to squeeze out a tiny bit more in another round, it's not worth the risk of her backing out completely. Accepting $725,000 is a significant saving compared to John's offer."
