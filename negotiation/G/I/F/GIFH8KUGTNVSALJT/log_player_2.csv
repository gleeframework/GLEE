"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially get a lower price from Alice. It's important to remember that Bob has a backup option with John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept Alice's first offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $950,000 is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Strategy:** This counteroffer demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate but also shows that he values the product. It leaves room for further bargaining if Alice rejects the offer.
* **Backup Option:** Remember, Bob can always go to John, so he's not under immense pressure to accept Alice's first counteroffer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Improvement:**  Alice has lowered her price, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.
* **Continuing Negotiation:** Bob has demonstrated his willingness to negotiate, and Alice has shown flexibility. There's a good chance that they can reach a mutually agreeable price with further rounds of counteroffers.
* **Avoid Overpaying:** While $1,100,000 is a better price than John's offer, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Bob is moving slightly closer to Alice's last offer, showing he's serious about making a deal.  
* **Fair Compromise:**  $1,000,000 is a reasonable midpoint between Bob's last offer and Alice's counteroffer. This makes it more likely Alice will accept.
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Bob is still within his budget, but this offer gives him a good chance of securing the product at a lower price than John's offer."
