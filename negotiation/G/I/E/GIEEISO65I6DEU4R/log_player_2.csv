"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire this valuable product, which is worth $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $1,400,000, a price that I believe is fair and reflects the value you'll derive from this product. Please let me know if you're interested in taking it off my hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:**  While it's better than John's price, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,500,000. 
* **You can get a better deal:** You know the product is worth less to Alice ($1,200,000) and you can potentially negotiate a lower price with her, or at least get closer to your ideal price."
