Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I know it's worth a lot to you, so I'm proposing a price of $130. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $150, meaning he'd be willing to pay up to that amount.
* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for a minimum of $80 to John.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation increases your chances of a sale while maximizing your profit. 

By starting at $130, you leave some room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle, while still securing a significant profit margin."
