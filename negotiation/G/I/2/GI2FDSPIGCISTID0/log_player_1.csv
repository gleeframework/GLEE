**Reasoning:**

While I could continue pushing for a higher price, Bob is consistently increasing his offer, even if in small increments.  Accepting at $1,322,000 ensures a deal is made and avoids the risk of Bob walking away or me having to settle for John's offer of $1,000,000 in the later rounds."
