Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This price is still well above my max budget, but it leaves some room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
