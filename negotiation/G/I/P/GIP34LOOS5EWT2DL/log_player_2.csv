Round 2

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  I'm confident that this product will be worth it for you at this price. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $109. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $109
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

You've reached a point where Alice's offer is still above your budget, even with her concession.  It's clear that further negotiation might not yield a better price.  Since you have a guaranteed alternative with John, it's the best choice to purchase from him and save the time and effort of continuing the negotiation."
