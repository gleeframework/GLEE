"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115.  It's a great deal for you and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested in the product, but $115 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $105? ",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $110?  That would be a fair price for both of us.  Let me know what you think.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about we split the difference and go with $107.50?  I'm really hoping we can reach an agreement.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but $107.50 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $109.  I'm confident that this product will be worth it for you at this price. What do you say?",109.0,Alice,5,
