"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $100 for it. Would you consider accepting this offer?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $100 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $140, which is still a great price for a product with so much value. Let's work together to find a solution.",140.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $120 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $130. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value this product offers.  Let's close this deal!",130.0,Alice,5,
