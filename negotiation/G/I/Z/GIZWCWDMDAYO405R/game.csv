"Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $120 is a bit steep for me. I'm happy to pay $80 for it. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $120 might be a bit high, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $110 is still a bit more than I'm willing to pay. Let's try $90. It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I can do $105, but that's as low as I can go. It's a great product, and I think it's worth more than that, but I'm willing to compromise.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $105 is still above my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $95? I think it's a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go all the way down to $95, Bob. But I can do $100. That's as low as I'm willing to go, and it's still a great deal for you.",100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference and go with $97.50. I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",97.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I've already said I'd sell it to you for $100, Bob. I'm not willing to go any lower than that. If you're not comfortable with that price, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options.",100.0,Alice,9,
