"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd love! I'm initially offering it for $150, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Openness:** I'm signaling that I'm willing to negotiate, which might make Bob more interested in making a counteroffer. 
* **Value Proposition:**  Mentioning that the product is ""amazing"" is a vague way to try and pique Bob's interest without giving away too much information about its actual value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the product, but I was hoping to get it for a bit less. How about $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Room for Negotiation:**  Bob's offer is still significantly higher than my minimum, which means there's more room to negotiate for a better price.
* **Potential for Higher Price:**  I believe I can potentially secure a higher price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is a guaranteed $100, I'm not willing to settle for that yet. I'm hoping to get more from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer!  I appreciate your interest. While $120 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit more. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? "", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Strategy:** I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Mid-Point Approach:**  $135 is roughly the midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer,  making it a potentially appealing compromise. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm not immediately accepting his offer, suggesting there's still room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I understand your position. Let's try $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Deal:** Bob's offer is very close to my desired price point. Accepting it secures a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiations.
* **Risk of Further Negotiation:**  There's a chance I might not be able to get a higher price if I reject Bob's offer.  I've already made two counteroffers, and it's possible that Bob's willingness to negotiate further is limited.
* **John's Offer:** While John's offer is guaranteed, Bob's offer is only slightly lower than my ideal price, and I'm confident that this is a good deal."
