Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my budget. I'm interested in the product, but $13,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Would you be willing to go down to $12,500?  I believe that's a fair price that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
