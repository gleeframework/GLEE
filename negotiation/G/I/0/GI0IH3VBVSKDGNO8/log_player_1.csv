Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you at a special price of $145. I believe it's a great deal for the value it provides. Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum Profit:**  You want to get as close to $150 as possible since that's your guaranteed sale price with John.
* **Bob's Valuation:**  Knowing Bob values the product at $120, offering it at or below that price is unlikely to be profitable for you.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a significant profit for you.

This strategy aims to balance maximizing profit from Bob while ensuring you don't lose the guaranteed sale to John."
