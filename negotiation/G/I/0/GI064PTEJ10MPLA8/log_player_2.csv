(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's better to try and negotiate with Alice first. You can likely get a better price than $110."

Round 3

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $110 is still a bit lower than my target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $112.50. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
While it's tempting to try and negotiate further, $112.5 is a good price for you.  You're still getting a good deal and avoiding having to buy from John for $120."
