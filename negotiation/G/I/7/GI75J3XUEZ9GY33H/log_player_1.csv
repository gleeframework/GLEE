Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $9,500. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 9500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob allows for potential profit maximization.
* **Strategic Pricing:** $9,500 is a strong offer that's significantly above Bob's perceived value of $8,000.  
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While unlikely, this offer could potentially lead to a counter-offer from Bob, further increasing the potential profit. 

By starting high but leaving some wiggle room, I increase my chances of securing the best possible deal."
