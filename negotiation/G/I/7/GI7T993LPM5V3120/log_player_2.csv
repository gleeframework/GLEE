"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $120. It's a great deal, as it's worth at least that much to me. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer matches your maximum price, there's no incentive to accept immediately.  You can try to get a better price by rejecting and seeing if she'll come down.  Worst case, you can always buy from John at the same price."
