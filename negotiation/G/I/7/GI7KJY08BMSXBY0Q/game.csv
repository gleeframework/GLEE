"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000.  I believe it's a fair starting point for discussions.",22000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $22,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure both of us benefit from the deal.",19000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $19,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $13,000, which is a significant jump from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I see you're serious about this purchase.  While $13,000 is still under what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $16,000. This is a firm offer, as I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",16000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",13000.0,Bob,6,
