Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I'm interested in the product,  $22,000 is unfortunately out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for getting back to me. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to come down to $19,000. This feels like a fair compromise to ensure both of us benefit from the deal."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $16,000 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a bit lower.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $13,000.  It's the absolute maximum I can go at this point.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:

**Reasoning:** 

Bob is stubbornly sticking to $13,000, and it's unlikely he'll budge significantly in the remaining rounds. Accepting his offer means a $2,000 loss compared to John's offer. It's time to cut losses and secure a guaranteed sale with John."
