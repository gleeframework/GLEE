"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1200000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good profit. Since Bob values the product at $800,000, there's room for negotiation. This initial offer is a strong starting point and will likely prompt a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $900,000 is a decent profit, I'm aiming for higher.  I believe I can push Bob closer to my target with a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still keeping it above Bob's offer. This counteroffer demonstrates that I'm willing to compromise while still aiming for a significant profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $950,000 is closer to my target, I still believe I can push Bob a little further. There are 6 rounds left, and I'm confident I can secure a better deal than selling to John for $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1050000} 
```

I'm now offering a price point that's exactly in the middle between my last offer and Bob's. This shows I'm willing to meet halfway, but still maintaining a price that's reasonable for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

We're running out of time and Bob is clearly not willing to go much higher.  While I'd prefer to get more,  John's offer is a safe bet and ensures I reach my minimum goal."
