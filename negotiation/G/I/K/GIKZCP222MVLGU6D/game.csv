"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,300,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm hoping for. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $1,350,000. This price allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's try to reach an agreement on this.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000, and that's my final offer.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're both trying to reach a price we're comfortable with. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,325,000. This is a significant move on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's finalize this deal and move forward.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to drop the price, but I'm still a bit far from being comfortable with $1,325,000. I'm willing to pay $1,275,000, which is the lowest I'm willing to go.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,275,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $1,300,000. This is a final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering your original offer. Let's end this negotiation and finalize the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
