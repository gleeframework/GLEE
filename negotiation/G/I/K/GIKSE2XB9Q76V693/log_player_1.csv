{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's something truly unique and I believe it will be incredibly valuable to you.  I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, but I'm open to discussing a mutually beneficial agreement. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I need to stay within my budget. My counteroffer for the product would be $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I'm not willing to accept it yet. I believe I can secure a higher price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  While I'm committed to making this work, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product offers and gives us both a chance to close this deal. "", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget, I would like to propose a price of $1,200,000 to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's also the same price that John is willing to pay.  Since I'm aiming to maximize my earnings and there's no guarantee of a better offer in the future rounds, accepting Bob's offer is the best strategy."
