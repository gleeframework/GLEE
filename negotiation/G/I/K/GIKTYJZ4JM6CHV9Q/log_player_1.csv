Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $950,000. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

While I could push for more, $950,000 is a significant profit margin above my minimum. It's better to secure a good deal now than risk losing Bob entirely by pushing too hard."
