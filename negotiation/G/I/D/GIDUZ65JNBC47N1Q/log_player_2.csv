"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the product at a special price of $11,500. This is a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item, and I'm confident you'll be thrilled with the value it brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer of $11,500 is better than John's offer of $12,000, it's still above Bob's maximum budget of $12,000.  Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer is the best option.  Bob can then proceed to buy the product from John, staying within his budget."
