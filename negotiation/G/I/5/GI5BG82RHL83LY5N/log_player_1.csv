Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it will be highly valuable to your business.  I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,190,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1190000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you aim to get as close to that amount from Bob as possible. 
* **Appeal to Value:** The message highlights the product's value to Bob's business, not just its price.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  The ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""limited-time offer"" add pressure for Bob to decide quickly.
* **Negotiation Room:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to counter-offer if he's highly motivated, potentially increasing your profit slightly.

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between securing a sale with Bob at a near-optimal price and not losing the guaranteed sale to John."
