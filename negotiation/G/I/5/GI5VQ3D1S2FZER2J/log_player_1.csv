Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000 (John), you want to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $14,000 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate up slightly if he's very interested while still ensuring you make a significant profit. 
* **Appear Reasonable:** Offering a price slightly below your guaranteed value makes you seem more open to a deal and might encourage Bob to accept without much back and forth. 

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes you are indifferent between selling to Bob or John, as long as the price difference is negligible.
* If you have reason to believe Bob might be willing to pay even more, you could start with a higher initial offer. However, this risks losing the sale to John if Bob rejects it."
