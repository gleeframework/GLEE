"Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** While Bob's maximum is $15,000, Alice is offering the product for $14,000. This means Bob saves $1,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice's offer is worse for Alice:** Alice is willing to sell for $12,000, but she is getting $14,000 from Bob. This is a good deal for Bob, but not the best for Alice."
