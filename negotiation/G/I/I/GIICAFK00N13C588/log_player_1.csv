Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:** $1,200,000 (from John's offer).
* **Potential upside:** I don't know Bob's valuation, but I'm hoping he might be willing to pay more than John.  
* **Balancing risk:** A higher price increases the chance Bob will reject the offer. However, even if he does, I still have a guaranteed $1,200,000 from John.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit and securing a reasonable return."
