Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great price, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  $1,200,000 is still significantly less than your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000, but it gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It shows you're willing to compromise:** This demonstrates a willingness to work with Bob and avoids appearing inflexible.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  If Bob rejects this offer, you have room to make counteroffers while still securing a price closer to your goal.

It's important to remember that the negotiation process is dynamic. Be prepared to adjust your strategy based on Bob's responses and keep in mind the potential of selling to John for $1,500,000 if the negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price given its value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $950,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. It's important to remember that I have a backup option in John, who is willing to pay my desired price.  Therefore, rejecting Bob's offer and continuing to negotiate is the best course of action. I'll aim for a price closer to my target in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to see a price closer to $1,100,000 to make this work. Let's find a compromise that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

Here's why this is a good counteroffer:

* **It shows willingness to compromise:**  By lowering my price from $1,200,000 to $1,100,000, I demonstrate that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **It keeps the price above my minimum:** $1,100,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's offer, but it leaves room for further negotiation if needed.
* **It sets a clear target:**  By specifying a target price of $1,100,000, I make it clear what I'm looking for, making it easier for Bob to understand my position.

Remember, I still have the option of selling to John for $1,500,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept any offer that's too low. This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving while maintaining a strategic position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your response, Alice. I understand your position and am willing to meet somewhere in the middle. My counteroffer is $1,050,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is a good compromise. It's closer to my desired price of $1,100,000 and still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. This deal allows me to secure a favorable price while avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potentially losing the deal with Bob.  I'm happy to accept his offer and move forward with the transaction."
