{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a valuable asset and I'm sure it will be a great investment for you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate, making him more likely to engage.
* **It's below your minimum acceptable value:** You're still getting a decent profit, even if Bob doesn't budge much.
* **It sets a clear expectation:** It lets Bob know that you're serious about selling but also that you won't give away the product for a bargain price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider my counteroffer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $850,000 is a decent amount, it's still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price with Bob before selling to John."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $850,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied.  This is my final offer. If you're not able to meet this price, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers."", ""product_price"": 900000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're willing to come down to $900,000, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $875,000. I really like the product and don't want to walk away, but I need to make sure I can afford it.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum acceptable value, it's still below my desired price. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm not prepared to sell the product for less than $900,000 yet."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $875,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $887,500.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $882,500, but no higher. I really like the product and want to make a deal, but I need to stay within my means. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $882,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $882,500

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Although Bob has come up to $882,500, which is close to my desired price, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $900,000. It's clear that Bob is not willing to reach my price point, so I will proceed with selling the product to John for $1,000,000. This ensures I achieve my minimum profit and avoids further negotiation with Bob."
