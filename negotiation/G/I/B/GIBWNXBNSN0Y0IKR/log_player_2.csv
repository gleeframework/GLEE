"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's well worth the value it offers. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

``` 
 
Alice's offer is too high. There's a good chance we can negotiate a better price, especially since we have John as a backup option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'm interested, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $600,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 600000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to save as much as possible, so we begin with a significantly lower offer than Alice's asking price. This gives us room to negotiate upwards.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** By offering $600,000, we signal that we're serious but also expect Alice to come down in price. This sets the stage for a potential compromise.
* **Backup Plan:**  We have John's offer of $800,000 in our back pocket. If Alice is completely unwilling to budge, we can always walk away and take that deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  I'll offer the product for $700,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from it. Let's see if we can close this deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Room for Negotiation:** While Alice came down in price, $700,000 is still higher than John's offer.  There's a chance we can get closer to $650,000, saving us another $50,000.
* **Strategic Counter-Offering:** By rejecting this offer, we signal that we're serious about getting a lower price and are willing to walk away if necessary.  

We'll continue negotiating, but we're getting closer to the point where accepting John's offer might make more sense."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we settle at $650,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me."",
""product_price"": 650000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're aiming for a price between our last offer ($600,000) and Alice's current offer ($700,000). This shows willingness to compromise but keeps us closer to our target.
* **Clear and Direct:** We're stating a specific price, making it clear what we're willing to pay. 
* **Sense of Urgency (Slightly):**  By suggesting this is a fair ""compromise,"" we subtly imply that this is our best offer, encouraging Alice to accept. 

We'll see if Alice bites. If not, we're running out of room to negotiate and John's deal is looking more appealing."
