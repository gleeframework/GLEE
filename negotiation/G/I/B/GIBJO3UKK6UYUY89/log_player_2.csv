"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its worth to you, and it allows me to maximize my profit.  Let me know if you're interested, otherwise, I'll be moving forward with another buyer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $1,500,000 from John if you reject Alice's offer. Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is still more than what you'd be willing to pay.  You should reject her offer and buy from John."
