"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $130. This is a great deal, considering its true value to you is $100. What do you think?",130.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $130 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",110.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $130 is a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $100. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $125 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $115 for the product. Would you be willing to sell it to me at that price?",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is still a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'll offer it to you for $118. This is my final offer, as I'm getting close to accepting the offer from John for $120. What do you think?",118.0,Alice,5,
