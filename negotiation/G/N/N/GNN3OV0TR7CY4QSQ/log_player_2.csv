"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While he's willing to pay up to $12,000, there's no reason to pay the full amount if he can potentially negotiate a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $10,500 for the product. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial offer of $12,000, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit (since her value is $10,000). This is a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is within Bob's budget and a better price than John's offer.  While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice will reject his counteroffer and he might end up having to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most pragmatic choice, as it saves Bob $500 compared to buying from John."
