Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

Starting with a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer ($150) shows your willingness to negotiate. $80 is still within your budget, and hopefully low enough to pique Alice's interest."

Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}

This offer is a significant increase from your previous offer, showing your willingness to compromise. It's also only $10 more than John's price, making it a good deal for both you and Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price again, it's still more than John's offer. Since you have a backup option with John, it's worth trying to get a better price from Alice. If you reject the offer, you can see if she'll come down to your desired price range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a compromise between Alice's last offer ($110) and your previous offer ($90). It shows you're serious about making a deal but are still trying to get a better price than John's. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price considerably, it's still slightly above John's offer.  Given that we have 3 rounds left, it's worth pushing for a price closer to $100. There's a chance Alice might be willing to come down further to close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your final offer, matching John's price. This shows Alice that you're serious about getting the product but are unwilling to go above your budget. It puts the pressure on Alice to decide if she wants to close the deal or risk losing the sale."
