"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her value for the product, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's worth attempting a counteroffer to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  If I can't, I'll always have the option of buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,250,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a counteroffer that's significantly lower than Alice's offer, but still higher than my maximum budget. This gives me room to negotiate while hopefully not immediately alienating Alice.  I'm aiming for a price close to my maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,380,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,380,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is still above my ideal price, but it's closer to my maximum budget of $1,200,000.  Further negotiation might be possible, but at this point, the risk of losing the deal to another buyer outweighs the potential savings. I'm better off accepting Alice's offer and securing the product."
