Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you consider a significant price reduction?"",

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, we're still quite far apart.  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To be honest, anything above $10,000 would be pushing it for me."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your honesty. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a realistic offer from you.  Would you be willing to meet at $15,000?  That's the lowest I'm prepared to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has made it clear that $15,000 is her absolute lowest price. This is still significantly higher than your maximum budget of $8,000 and the guaranteed price from John.  Continuing the negotiation is unlikely to result in a price you're willing to pay."
