Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $22,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 22000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $22,000 is way too high for me. This product would be valuable to me at around $8,000. Would you consider a significant price reduction? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $22,000 is my initial asking price, I understand your perspective. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This offer reflects the true value of the product."", ""product_price"": 18000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're still quite far apart.  I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle, but $18,000 is still much higher than what I'm comfortable paying. To be honest, anything above $10,000 would be pushing it for me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your honesty. I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is just too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need a realistic offer from you.  Would you be willing to meet at $15,000?  That's the lowest I'm prepared to go."", ""product_price"": 15000}"
