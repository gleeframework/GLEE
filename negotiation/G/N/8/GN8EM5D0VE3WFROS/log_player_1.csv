{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  At $1,000,000, you are leaving some room for negotiation, but still making a profit. 
* **It's below your minimum:** You are willing to take less than your minimum of $1,200,000 to potentially secure a deal.
* **It leaves room for counteroffers:** This allows for a back-and-forth negotiation that might get you closer to your desired price.

Keep in mind, you can always adjust the offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Could you do $650,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price and even lower than what he values the product at.  It's not in your best interest to accept this offer.  You should counteroffer to try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $650,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  However, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Reasonable Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise between your desired price and Bob's offer. It's closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  The message highlights the value of the product, making it more likely for Bob to see the value in your counteroffer.
* **Fair Deal:** By emphasizing a fair deal for both parties, you create a sense of partnership and encourage Bob to come to an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  How about $720,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $720,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $720,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $720,000 is closer to your minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000, it's still significantly less than the value you place on the product. You're better off rejecting this offer and making another counteroffer to try and bridge the gap further. Remember, you have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000, so there's no need to settle for a significantly lower price if you don't have to."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, and $720,000 is closer, but it's still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $800,000.  This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** This counteroffer is a genuine attempt to meet Bob halfway, bridging the gap between your previous offer of $850,000 and his latest offer of $720,000. 
* **Fairness:** The message emphasizes the fairness of the offer and the value of the product. 
* **Positive Tone:** A friendly tone encourages Bob to see the value in reaching a deal. 

This counteroffer is strategically designed to potentially close the deal while still maintaining your desired profit margin.  If Bob still rejects, you can always consider selling to John."
