Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,999. I believe it's a fantastic deal and would save you money compared to what you'd pay elsewhere."", 
""product_price"": 11999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($10,000) as possible without going below her minimum ($12,000).
* **Create Urgency:**  By slightly inflating the price and mentioning a potential ""deal,"" Alice creates a sense of urgency and implies that Bob might miss out if he doesn't accept.
* **Backup Plan:** Alice has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, ensuring she won't be forced to go below her minimum.

This strategy gives Alice the best chance of securing a price that's both profitable and acceptable to Bob."
