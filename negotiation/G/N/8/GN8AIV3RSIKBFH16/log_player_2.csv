Alice's offer is still too high. It's worth continuing the negotiation and trying to get a lower price."

Alice is getting closer to my ideal price, but $1,350,000 is still a bit high. I'm willing to keep negotiating to try and get a lower price."

This is a good deal for me. I'm getting the product at a price slightly higher than my initial target, but the additional support package adds value and makes the price more palatable.  It's definitely better than buying from John at $1,200,000, as I'm getting something extra for only $25,000 more."
