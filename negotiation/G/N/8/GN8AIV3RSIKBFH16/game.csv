"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.

,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation. However, $1,500,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm interested in the product and believe it's worth $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that price and hope we can come to an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,200,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $1,400,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product brings to you. Let me know if this is something you'd like to consider.",1400000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's aim for a figure closer to my initial offer of $1,200,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000 for this product.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I'd like to add a bit more to the price. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price, considering the value it brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise between our initial offers.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your flexibility,  $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. I'm willing to go up to $1,325,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm hopeful we can finalize the deal at this price.",1325000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $1,325,000, but I'd like to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $25,000, which will give you an even better experience with the product. This brings the total value to $1,350,000. I'm confident this is a fair price, and I'm excited to finalize the deal with you.",1325000.0,Alice,7,
