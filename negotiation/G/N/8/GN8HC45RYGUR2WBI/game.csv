"Bob, I understand your constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",875000.0,Bob,4,

This price reflects a compromise on my part, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe it's a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this agreement.",925000.0,Alice,5,
