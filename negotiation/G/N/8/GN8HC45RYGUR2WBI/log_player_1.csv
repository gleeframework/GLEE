{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. I believe this is a fair price, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Offer price:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my minimum value ($1,000,000) but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Message:** I'm framing the offer as a fair deal, acknowledging Bob's potential value for the product. This can make him more likely to consider it. 

**Strategy:**

By starting with a higher price, I'm trying to maximize my earnings. However, I'm not going too high, as I don't want to immediately scare Bob away.  I'm also giving him a clear message that I'm willing to negotiate but I value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm only able to go up to $850,000.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price reflects my budget. I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial solution. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $850,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at a price that drastically undervalues the product for me.  

**Strategy:**

By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain my negotiating power. I'll try to counter with a higher price that's more aligned with my desired value. If Bob still refuses, I can always choose to sell to John for my minimum acceptable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $850,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $900,000. This price still reflects the value you'll gain from the product, while allowing me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm counteroffering at $900,000, which is halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate. 
* **Message:**  I reiterate the value the product offers to Bob while justifying my counteroffer as a fair compromise. I aim to build a sense of cooperation.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer keeps the negotiations moving forward while staying above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm trying to find a middle ground that might be appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go to $875,000, which represents a good compromise for both of us.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer of $875,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than what I consider a fair value for the product.  I'm not willing to compromise my bottom line just to finalize a deal.

**Strategy:**

I'll continue to negotiate with Bob, hoping to get a better offer.  I'm still confident I can secure a price closer to my desired value. If Bob remains inflexible, I can always sell to John for my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose out on a significant profit."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand your budget constraints, but $875,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $925,000.  This price reflects a compromise on my part, but it still allows me to make a reasonable profit.  I believe it's a fair deal that benefits both of us. Let's finalize this agreement."", ""product_price"": 925000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm proposing $925,000, which is a slight decrease from my previous offer. This demonstrates flexibility without significantly impacting my profit margin.
* **Message:** I reiterate the value of the product for Bob while framing my counteroffer as a fair compromise that benefits both parties. 

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Maintain my bargaining power:** I'm not giving in too quickly.
* **Signal willingness to compromise:** The slight decrease shows I'm open to negotiation.
* **Push for a higher price:** $925,000 is still closer to my desired value than Bob's last offer.

I'm hoping Bob will recognize the value of the product and accept my counteroffer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating or sell to John if needed."
