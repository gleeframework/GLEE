Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm starting with an offer of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate down if necessary while still making a profit that's higher than my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is far too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $10,000. This is still a decent profit for me, and hopefully, it's enticing enough for Bob to reconsider."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is still too low. I'm going to reject it and counteroffer again."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000.  This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's last offer, but still gives me a profit that's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

Bob's offer is getting closer, but I'm starting to feel like this negotiation isn't going to get me a price I'm happy with.  I'm going to cut my losses and sell to John for $12,000."
