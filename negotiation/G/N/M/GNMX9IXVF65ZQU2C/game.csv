"Bob, thanks for your offer, but $6,500 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is my lowest price. This is still a great deal, and I believe it's worth it for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  How about we meet in the middle at $7,250?",7250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,250 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,000, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for a product that's worth a lot to you. Let's finalize this deal.",8000.0,Alice,5,
