"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $18,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully secure a good price. I've left some wiggle room, but still above my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand your product is valuable, but I can only afford to pay up to $15,000 for it. Could we possibly meet in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is at my minimum value, I believe I can get a better price. I'll reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $15,000 isn't quite enough for me.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $16,500.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 16500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a price of $15,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is again at my minimum, and while I could continue to negotiate, we are already four rounds in. I don't want to risk losing the deal completely, so I'll sell to John for $15,000, which is my minimum acceptable price."
