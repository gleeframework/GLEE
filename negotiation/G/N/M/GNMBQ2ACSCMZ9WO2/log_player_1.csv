"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product.  Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $14,000.  I'm confident it can exceed your expectations and deliver exceptional results."", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $9,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you countering. I understand your perspective on the price. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $12,000. This reflects the true value and benefits the product offers. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,500, but I need to be honest, I'm getting a bit concerned that we might not meet in the middle. Can you consider going lower? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

Explanation:  Bob is stubbornly sticking close to his initial offer, and while he increased it slightly, it's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better for me.  It's time to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John and move on."
