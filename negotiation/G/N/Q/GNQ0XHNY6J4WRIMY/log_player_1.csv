Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $11,000. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 11000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize profit with Bob:** While you have John as a backup, it's always better to try and get the highest price possible. 
* **Leave room for negotiation:** Starting at $11,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate a slightly higher price, getting you closer to your $12,000 minimum. 
* **Higher than Bob's perceived value:** The price is still significantly higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000. However, this initial offer is meant to gauge his interest and potential for negotiation. 

This approach balances the risk of losing Bob with the potential for a higher profit than selling directly to John."
