"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the product for $12,000. This is a great deal for you, as it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable addition to your collection. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,000 is less than your maximum budget, there's room for negotiation. Alice is clearly motivated to sell and you have a backup option with John. By rejecting this offer, you might be able to get a better price from Alice or you can always fall back on buying from John for $15,000."
