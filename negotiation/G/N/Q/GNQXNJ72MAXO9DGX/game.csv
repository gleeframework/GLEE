"Hi Bob, I understand that you're working with a tighter budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $5,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to your business.",6500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $6,000 is a comfortable price for you, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $6,250.
