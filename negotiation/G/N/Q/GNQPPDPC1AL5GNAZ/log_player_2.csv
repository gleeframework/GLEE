"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to let it go for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is less than the maximum you're willing to pay, it's still more than what the product is worth to Alice. You can likely get a better deal by counteroffering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $105. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can do a bit better than that. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really like it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a decent deal for Bob.  While Bob might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars by continuing to negotiate, it's likely that Alice will be less willing to budge further.  At $110, Bob is getting the product for a price that's significantly lower than John's offer, making it a good deal overall."
