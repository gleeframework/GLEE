"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $9,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to me ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This gives me room to negotiate down if needed, while still aiming for a higher profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $7,500.  This reflects the value of the product to me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```

I'm going to counter with $7,500, which is still above my minimum but closer to Bob's offer. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget.  How about we meet in the middle at $6,750?  That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is higher than before, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I'm going to reject his offer and continue negotiating to try and get a better price.  There's still room to work with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer, but $6,750 still doesn't quite work for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again at $7,125. This would be a fair price for both of us, considering the value of the product. Let's try to close this deal."", ""product_price"": 7125}
```

I'm continuing to counter with a price that's higher than Bob's offer but lower than my previous counteroffer.  This shows good faith and a willingness to negotiate, while also keeping my minimum acceptable price in mind. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement within a couple more rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is a fair deal you're offering but I'm really trying to keep it under $7,000. Would you be willing to do $6,900 and we can close the deal right now? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  While we're getting close, I'm going to reject his offer and try one more counteroffer to see if we can close the deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down to $7,000 for this product, which is a fair price considering its value.  If you're serious about getting this, I'm ready to close the deal now."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```

I'm offering $7,000 which is still above my minimum acceptable price but closer to Bob's offer. I'm hoping that by showing flexibility and emphasizing the value of the product, we can reach a deal in this round."
