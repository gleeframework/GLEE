Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm asking for $12,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its worth. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $10,000, you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation if he tries to counter-offer. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning the product's ""value"" without being specific, you anchor the price in Bob's mind.  
* **Open to Negotiation:** The phrase ""What do you think?"" implies you're open to discussing the price, making Bob more likely to engage rather than just rejecting the offer outright.

**Important Note:** Even if Bob rejects this initial offer, you still have the option to lower the price or negotiate further before resorting to selling to John for your minimum acceptable price."
