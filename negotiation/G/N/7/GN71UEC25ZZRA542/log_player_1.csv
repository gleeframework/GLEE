"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product.  Given its unique potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,800,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the immense value it can bring you."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (Anchoring):**  By beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum, I aim to set a strong anchor. This can influence Bob's perception of the product's worth.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** The high initial price gives me ample space to negotiate downwards while still aiming for a final price significantly above my minimum.
* **Conveying Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's ""unique potential"" and ""immense value,"" aiming to justify the high asking price and appeal to Bob's potential desire for a good deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer immediately matches my minimum acceptable price. While I could accept and close the deal now, there's a good chance I can negotiate a higher price.  I'll counter-offer in Round 3 to try and secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming to the table.  While I recognize your offer, the value of this product goes beyond that.  Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $1,500,000?"",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Signaling Flexibility:** I acknowledge Bob's offer as a starting point, showing I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Significant Drop:** The substantial decrease from my initial offer ($300,000) signals a desire to find a compromise and might make Bob more receptive. 
* **Still Above My Minimum:** The $1,500,000 price point keeps me well above my $1,200,000 minimum, allowing room for further negotiation if needed.
* **""Meeting in the Middle"":** This framing suggests fairness and encourages Bob to reciprocate with a counter-offer closer to my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go as high as $1,000,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is now significantly below my minimum acceptable price. While I want to secure a deal with Bob if possible, going as low as $1,000,000 is too much of a loss. I will counter-offer in the next round, but I need to be prepared to walk away and sell to John for my minimum price if Bob doesn't move significantly closer to my range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your constraints, but $1,000,000 is significantly below what I can accept.  This product has considerable value, and I'm confident it can bring you a substantial return.  To be frank, I have another buyer ready at $1,200,000.  If you can meet that price, the product is yours. If not, I'll need to move forward with the other offer."",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm but Fair:** I'm standing firm at my $1,200,000 minimum while acknowledging Bob's budget limitations. 
* **Introducing Competition:**  By mentioning John's offer, I'm creating a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to make a more competitive offer.
* **Final Offer:** I'm framing this as my final offer, making it clear that I'm willing to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my price. This can sometimes push hesitant buyers to make a decision. 
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  While firm, my message still expresses a preference for closing the deal with Bob, encouraging him to meet my requirements."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not interested in letting you sell the product to someone else, and I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,000,000 and $1,200,000, so I'll offer $1,100,000. That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has met us halfway and is showing a strong desire to secure the product. While I could push for the full $1,200,000, the difference is relatively small at this point. Accepting $1,100,000 ensures a quick and favorable sale, and it's still a significant profit over my minimum acceptable price.  There's more value in securing a good deal now than risking further negotiation and potentially losing Bob as a buyer."
