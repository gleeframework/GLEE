"I appreciate your confidence in the product, Alice, but I'm not willing to pay $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. I think that's a fair price considering the market value you mentioned earlier.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to reach an agreement.  Let's find a middle ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down, Alice, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering the market value and the discount you've already offered.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm going to be upfront: I'm not willing to go lower than $1,000,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you've confirmed the product has for you.  It's time we meet in the middle.  I'm confident this is the best deal we can both achieve.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
