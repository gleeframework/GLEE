Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,400,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product. It's a fair price that allows us both to make a profit.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

I'm not going to accept Bob's offer yet. While it's a decent price, I believe I can still get more. I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000.  This is a good compromise that lets us both walk away happy. What do you think?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While it's getting closer to what I want, I still believe I can push for a higher price. I'll make another counteroffer in the next round."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low.  Let's split the difference. I'll come down to $1,275,000. It's a fair compromise that allows us both to get what we want. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1275000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still a little more than I can comfortably afford right now. I'm willing to pay $1,260,000 for the product. It's a fair price that gets us both closer to our goals. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,260,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,260,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not the ideal price, it's a good compromise.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether, and I'm not willing to risk selling to John for a lower price."
