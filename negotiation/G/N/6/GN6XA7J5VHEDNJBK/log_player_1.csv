"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  How about we meet somewhere in the middle? Would $700,000 work for you? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I will counteroffer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $850,000 is still a bit of a stretch.  Would you be willing to consider $750,000? I think that's a fair offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer.  However, $750,000 is still below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to come down a little further to $825,000.  This is a fair price considering the value this product holds for you.  Let's try to find common ground at this point."", ""product_price"": 825000}
