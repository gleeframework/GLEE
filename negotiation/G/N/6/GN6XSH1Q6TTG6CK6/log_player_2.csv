"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you won't find a better price anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is a good starting point, but it's still too high. Bob wants to save as much money as possible, so he should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,000 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $8000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $9200. It's a fair middle ground, and I'm confident you'll really like the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down a bit, but $9,200 is still more than Bob is willing to pay at this point. It makes sense to continue negotiating to see if they can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  I'm still hoping for a price closer to $8,000.  I'll offer $8,500.  It's a fair price, and I'm sure you'll be happy with the sale."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking for a price closer to $8000, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9200 and $8500. How about $8850? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,850. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,850
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $8,850 is a good price, Bob is still determined to get the product for under $8,500.  He can likely push a bit further, but he needs to be mindful of the limited rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $8,850 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,600.  Let's close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 8600}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're still trying to get the price as low as possible, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too far away from my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more compromise. How about $8700? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has a few rounds left, but Alice is clearly not willing to go lower than $8,700.  Accepting this offer is the best way to secure the product for a good price without risking going too much higher. The risk of going over $12,000 with Jhon is too high."
