"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is within your budget, it's still higher than the product's value to her. There's room for negotiation, and rejecting the offer allows you to try and secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I'm interested, $1,400,000 is a bit high for me. Given the product's value, I'm willing to pay $1,300,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price that's still higher than Alice's value of $1,200,000 but significantly lower than her initial offer. This shows that I'm serious about buying the product but also willing to negotiate.  This counteroffer should create room for a compromise."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,300,000 is too low. How about we meet in the middle at $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is still within my budget and represents a good compromise. It's higher than my last counteroffer but lower than her original price.  Accepting this offer allows me to secure the product while still saving money compared to buying it from John."
