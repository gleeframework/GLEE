"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further, of course. What are your thoughts?",2300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  while I appreciate the opportunity, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000, considering the value I place on this product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,200,000  falls short of what I consider fair value for this product. Let's bridge the gap - how about we settle at $1,950,000?  This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I see the value in this product,  $1,950,000 is still outside my range.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This reflects a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,400,000 is close, but to make this deal happen, I need to be at $1,650,000. This is my final offer, and it reflects the absolute lowest price I'm willing to accept.",1650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to get a certain price, but $1,650,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,500,000.  This is my final offer, and I hope we can close this deal. ",1500000.0,Bob,6,
