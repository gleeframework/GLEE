"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this amazing product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $10,000. I believe it's a fair deal and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $14,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This price is still above my maximum value, so it's a fair deal for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $11,000. Considering your willingness to pay $11,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $13,000. This is a fair price that takes into account your maximum value for the product and my minimum value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",13000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $11,000.  It's a fair price that allows both of us to make a reasonable profit. If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look at other options.",11000.0,Bob,4,
