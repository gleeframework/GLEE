Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $11,000.

This is a fair price that takes into account your maximum value for the product and my minimum value. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.
