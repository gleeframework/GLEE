Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it will be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $950,000, which reflects its true value and potential.  What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay even more. 
* **Strategic Pricing:**  Offering the product slightly below your minimum ($1,000,000) at $950,000 creates a sense of a ""good deal"" for Bob, as it's still significantly more than his perceived value ($800,000). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, the message implies a willingness to discuss. If Bob negotiates, you have room to decrease the price slightly and still make a profit beyond John's offer."
