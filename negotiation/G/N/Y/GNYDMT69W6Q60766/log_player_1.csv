"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm open to offers, but I'm looking for at least $135 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. This gives him room to counter without feeling like he's being squeezed too hard, while also ensuring I'm not giving away too much value too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer. I'm interested in the product and would like to propose a price of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum price, but I'm not in a rush to sell. I believe there's still room for negotiation. I'll counter with a higher price and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $120 is my minimum, I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $125? It's a fair compromise and ensures I can cover my costs."", ""product_price"": 125}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand your position, but I believe we can still reach an agreement. Would $120 still be too low for you, considering your costs? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is stubbornly stuck at my minimum price. While I could continue negotiating, it's unlikely he'll budge.  I've already wasted two rounds and it's unlikely I'll get a better price from Bob.  Selling to John ensures I don't lose out on potential profit and saves me further negotiation headaches."
