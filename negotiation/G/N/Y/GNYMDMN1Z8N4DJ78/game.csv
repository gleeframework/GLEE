"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique item that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to start the negotiation at $11000.",11000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for a good deal, Bob, but I'm afraid $9000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $12000, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10500. This is a fair price that I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's a good compromise for both of us.",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but I think that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $10500, but I'll throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. I'll include a free premium service package that's normally worth $1000. This way, you'll get the product at a great price and some extra benefits. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional value you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between your offer and my previous offer. Can you consider meeting me at $9950?",9950.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go below $10500. I'm willing to throw in another benefit to sweeten the deal - I'll give you a 1-year warranty on the product, which is normally not included. This way, you'll have added protection and peace of mind. Can we meet at $10500?",10500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the additional warranty you're offering, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10200, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider meeting me at $10200?",10200.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to go up to $10200, Bob, but I'm still a bit short of my target price. I'm willing to throw in another concession - I'll give you a 5% discount on the original price, which would bring the price down to $11400. This is a significant concession, and I believe it's the best offer I can make. What do you think?",11400.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my limit, and I'm going to have to walk away. I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $12000. I hope we can come to an agreement, but I'm not willing to go above $10200. Good luck with the sale.",10200.0,Bob,10,
