"I'm interested in the product, but I think the price is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. I'm open to further discussion and willing to negotiate to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your financial constraints, $900000 is significantly below the true value of this product. To reflect its unique capabilities and potential, I'm willing to reduce my price to $1300000. This represents a substantial concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in moving forward at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate the concession you've made, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1100000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that takes into account the product's value and my budget. Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product and your willingness to negotiate. While $1100000 is a step in the right direction, it's still slightly below what I need to consider selling. Given the exceptional capabilities and potential of this product, I'm willing to go down to $1250000. This offer reflects a compromise on my part, and I believe it represents a fair price for both of us. I'm confident this product will be a valuable asset to you. Let me know if you're interested in finalizing the deal at this price.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand that you're willing to compromise, Alice, and I appreciate that. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more offer: $1150000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. If not, I'll need to consider purchasing the product from John for $800000.",1150000.0,Bob,6,
