"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding my minimum desired value.  I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to negotiate up to my desired price."

While $14,500 is closer to my minimum, I'm not ready to settle yet. I believe I can push for a higher price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price in the next round."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John. We've been going back and forth for a while, and while I'm confident I could get a slightly higher price from Bob, there's no guarantee that he'll budge any further.  It's getting late in the game, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether.  John's offer is a safe bet, and it's still significantly above my minimum."
