"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment.",2050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $1,975,000?  That's a strong show of good faith on my end, and I believe it's a price we can both feel good about.",1975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,975,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll counter with $1,900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget.",1900000.0,Bob,6,
