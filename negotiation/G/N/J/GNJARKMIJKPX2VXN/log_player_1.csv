Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm a bit concerned about the initial price. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it if we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, I'm still aiming higher in these early rounds.  I'll counter in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $1,800,000 is still too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $2,050,000? This reflects the true value of the product while still offering you a significant return on your investment."",
""product_price"": 2050000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $2,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'll counter with $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value while also being mindful of my financial constraints. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

 ""decision"": ""RejectOffer""

Bob is moving closer to my range, but I think I can still get a bit more.  I'll counter again in the next round."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's make this happen. How about $1,975,000?  That's a strong show of good faith on my end, and I believe it's a price we can both feel good about."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,975,000, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll counter with $1,900,000, which is the highest price I'm willing to pay. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value and my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000

{
 ""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
``` 

Bob is clearly holding firm at $1,900,000. While I'd like to get more, it's a strong offer and there's a risk he walks away if I push further.  It's better to take the guaranteed $1,900,000 than risk ending up with John's $1,500,000."
