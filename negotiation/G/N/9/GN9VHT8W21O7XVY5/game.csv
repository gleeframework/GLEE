"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $1,100,000. This is a great deal, considering the value you place on it is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a fair offer.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me.  I'd be willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  It's a fair price that considers both our valuations.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Bob, but $900,000 is a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a compromise that should satisfy both our valuations.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. How about $950,000?  That's a significant jump from my initial offer and shows I'm serious about making this deal work.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad to see you're serious about making a deal, Bob! However, $950,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make another compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000, but I'm willing to meet you halfway between that and $950,000, which is $1,000,000. Let's meet in the middle at $1,000,000.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
