"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json

``` 
This is a simple decision.  Alice's offer is above your maximum price. You should try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for offering, Alice!  That price is a little high for me. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

This counter-offer aims to:

* **Be polite and maintain a good negotiating relationship.** 
* **Establish a starting point significantly below your maximum price.** This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring any eventual agreement benefits you. 
* **Gauge Alice's flexibility.**  Her response will indicate how willing she is to negotiate."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is moving closer to your desired price, it's still beneficial to negotiate further. You're aiming for $100 or less, and with some back-and-forth, you might secure a better deal than $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  How about we settle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
```

This counter-offer:

* **Acknowledges Alice's compromise** to maintain a positive tone.
* **Proposes a price point closer to her current offer** to signal seriousness while still aiming for a better deal. 
* **Leaves room for a potential final counter-offer from Alice**, which could be at or below your $100 limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to your offer, Bob! I'm willing to give a bit more. How about we try $92? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $92. Accepting this offer gets you the product for $8 less than John's price, which is a good deal."
