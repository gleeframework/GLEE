Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm looking for a price of $22,000.  I think you'll find this to be a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 22000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge Bob's interest. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""unique value"" of the product, I'm aiming to frame the price as justified, even though it's above Bob's current valuation.
* **Alternative:**  I'm keeping in mind my option to sell to John for $15,000. This provides me with a strong fallback position if negotiations with Bob don't progress favorably."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering this product. While I recognize its value, your asking price is a bit high for my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is far below both my minimum acceptable price ($15,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($8,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. I'll counter-offer in a way that moves the negotiation closer to a mutually beneficial outcome while still keeping my minimum price in mind."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the product's true value. To be fair, I could consider a price of $18,000. I believe this reflects the value you'll gain from it."", ""product_price"": 18000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** While I'm lowering my initial asking price, I'm still aiming high. This counter-offer serves two purposes: 
    * It signals I'm willing to negotiate.
    * It encourages Bob to move closer to my acceptable range. 
* **Focus on Value:**  I'm reiterating the product's value to Bob. This reinforces the idea that while the price is high, it's justified by the benefits he'll receive.
* **Fallback Position:**  I remain aware of John's standing offer of $15,000. This knowledge gives me leverage in the negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the product has value, but $18,000 is still too high for me.  I could go up to $7,000. That's a fair offer considering John is offering a similar product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimal Movement:** Bob's offer increased by only $1,000, showing reluctance to approach a price that reflects the product's value to him ($8,000) or my minimum ($15,000).
* **False Comparison:** Bob mentioning ""John offering a similar product"" is likely a negotiation tactic. It could be misinformation to pressure me into a lower price.
* **Strong Alternative:** My guaranteed sale to John for $15,000 gives me a strong position. I'm willing to walk away from the negotiation with Bob if he isn't willing to make a reasonable offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but the price gap is still too wide.  I need to get at least $15,000 for this product.  I'm willing to come down to $16,000 as my final offer.  This is a great deal considering its true value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 16000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:** I'm setting a clear bottom line of $15,000 and presenting $16,000 as a final offer to signal seriousness.
* **Justification:** I'm re-emphasizing the product's value to counter Bob's attempt to downplay it by mentioning a competitor.
* **Time Sensitivity:** By making a final offer, I'm introducing a sense of urgency that might encourage Bob to act quickly. 
* **Walk-Away Readiness:** I'm prepared to walk away from the negotiation if Bob doesn't accept this offer, knowing I have John's $15,000 offer as a safety net."
