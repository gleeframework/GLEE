Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", 
""product_price"": 149
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get the highest price possible from Bob while still enticing him to buy.
* **Bob's Value:** We know Bob values the product at $120.
* **Alternative Buyer:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John. 
* **Negotiation Power:**  Offering a price slightly below John's offer ($149) creates a sense of urgency and a perceived ""good deal"" for Bob, while still securing a profit above Bob's perceived value.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
