"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $15,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $8,500 is significantly below its true value.  I could consider letting it go for $13,500.  This is a very fair offer.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I'm still not comfortable with $13,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,000?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away with a good deal.",11000.0,Bob,4,
