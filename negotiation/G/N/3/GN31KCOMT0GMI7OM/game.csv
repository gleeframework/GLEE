"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my price range.  What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle?",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference this time? $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a fantastic product at a great value. Let's close this deal.",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,750 is simply not enough. I'm willing to go down to $9,900, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen.",9900.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price.",9500.0,Bob,8,
