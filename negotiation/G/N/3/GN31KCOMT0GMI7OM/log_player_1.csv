"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm keeping the message friendly and positive, encouraging Bob to engage in the conversation.
* **Value Proposition:**  I'm hinting at the product's value, hoping to make Bob feel like he's getting a good deal.

**Strategy:**

I want to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. If he rejects this offer, I'll adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer. If he accepts, great! If he doesn't, I'll still have several rounds to work with before turning to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $9,000 is still significantly lower than my minimum value of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Potential:** There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Avoiding John:** While selling to John would guarantee $15,000, I can likely get closer to that amount by continuing negotiations with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'll also try to understand why Bob is so low on his offer to adjust my strategy accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to stay within my price range.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm offering a price that's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to compromise.
* **Reframing the Value:** I'm highlighting the ""great deal"" aspect again, trying to reframe the price in a positive light.
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum acceptable price, while leaving space for further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and move the negotiation closer to my desired price point. If he rejects again, I'll continue to counter, but I'll start considering the option of selling to John if the offers don't improve."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $9,500 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  We're still only in round 4, and there are several rounds remaining to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.
* **John is a Backstop:** While selling to John would guarantee a higher price, I'm not desperate to sell yet.  There's still potential for a better deal with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to my $10,500.  I'll need to assess why Bob is so persistent with his low offer and adjust my negotiation approach accordingly."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we split the difference this time? $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives you a fantastic product at a great value. Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a price that's in the middle of our previous two offers, demonstrating a willingness to compromise.
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth, hoping to sway him towards accepting.
* **Closing Language:**  I'm using phrases like ""close this deal"" to encourage a sense of urgency and finality.

**Strategy:**

* **Moving Closer:** This offer moves me closer to my desired price point while showing a commitment to reaching an agreement.
* **Testing the Waters:**  I'm curious to see if Bob will finally accept or if he'll continue to push for a lower price.  If he rejects, I'll need to reassess my strategy and consider selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $9,750? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  $9,750 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **Negotiation Still Possible:** We're only in round 6, and I have several more rounds to potentially reach a more favorable deal.
* **John is a Safe Option:**  While selling to John would guarantee a higher price, I'm not desperate to sell yet. There's still a chance of getting closer to my ideal price with Bob.

**Strategy:**

I'll counter Bob's offer again, aiming for a price closer to $10,000.  I'll need to analyze Bob's persistence with his low offer and adjust my negotiation approach accordingly. I'll also start to consider selling to John if the next few rounds don't bring a significant improvement in the offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating, but $9,750 is simply not enough. I'm willing to go down to $9,900, which is a fair compromise considering the value of this product.  Let's find common ground and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 9900}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:** I'm offering a small concession, showing I'm willing to move closer to Bob's offer.
* **Value Emphasis:** I'm once again emphasizing the product's worth to encourage Bob to reconsider his stance.
* **Urgency:** I'm using ""make this deal happen"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept.

**Strategy:**

* **Getting Closer:** I'm getting closer to Bob's desired price, but still maintaining a price above my minimum.
* **Testing Bob's Limit:** I'm curious to see how far Bob is willing to go. If he rejects this offer, I'll start considering selling to John, especially since we're nearing the halfway point in the negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,900 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds. Bob's insistence on a price below my minimum is making it difficult to close the deal.
* **Risk of Walking Away:** Bob's threat to walk away adds uncertainty to the outcome. 
* **John's Guarantee:** Selling to John provides a guaranteed $15,000, eliminating risk and ensuring I meet my minimum desired price.

**Strategy:**

While I'd prefer to get closer to my ideal price, the risk of Bob walking away and the limited rounds left make selling to John the most logical choice.  It guarantees a higher price, and I'm not confident I can negotiate a better deal with Bob in the remaining rounds."
