"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Can you meet me at that price?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's value. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. How about $1,000,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,000,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $900,000 and $1,000,000. How about $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $950,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal.  What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down to $975,000. However, I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $950,000 and $975,000. How about $962,500?",962500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, I'm still hoping to secure a price closer to the product's true value. Let's meet halfway between my last offer and yours. How about $968,750? This is a fair compromise that allows us to both find a suitable solution.",968750.0,Alice,7,
