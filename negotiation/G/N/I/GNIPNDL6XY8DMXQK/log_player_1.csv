Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to stay within a budget of $8,000. Would you be willing to consider a price of $6,500 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has value, but $9,750 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $7,500, but that's the maximum I can stretch. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the minimum I'm willing to accept. John offers a guaranteed $8,000, which is a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob."
