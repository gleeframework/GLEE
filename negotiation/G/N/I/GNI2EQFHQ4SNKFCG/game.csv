"I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you, Bob. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,200,000 for the product. I'm confident that you'll see the value in this deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a little high for me. Would you consider $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. My counteroffer is $1,100,000. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? ",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950,000, Bob. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. My counteroffer is $1,050,000. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand the value of the product and I'm willing to meet you halfway between our last offers. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"We're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $1,000,000, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to make a slight adjustment. My counteroffer is $1,025,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and our previous discussions.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
