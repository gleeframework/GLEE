"Alice, that's a very generous offer, but unfortunately, I'm not able to go that high at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. I'm hoping we can come to an agreement that works for both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $2,300,000 is closer to its true market value.  To move this along, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is my final offer.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $2,000,000 is still out of my price range. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000, which is a significant amount for me. If you're serious about selling the product, I believe this is a fair price that we can both agree on.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
