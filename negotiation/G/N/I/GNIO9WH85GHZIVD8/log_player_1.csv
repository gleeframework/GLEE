Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you stand to gain."", 
""product_price"": 1150000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible without pushing him away. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The offer of $1,150,000 leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer, potentially leading to a slightly higher final price.
* **Strong But Not Greedy:**  This price point demonstrates that we understand the product's worth and are seeking a strong return, but aren't being overly aggressive and risking losing the sale altogether. 
* **Backup Option:** We have the safety net of John's offer ($1,000,000), ensuring we don't lose money if Bob rejects the initial proposal."
