Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, playing the role of Alice:

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it would be a wise investment for you. I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $1,500,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Strong but Not Greedy:** Offering it for $1,500,000 (Bob's max) might seem too greedy and could make Bob walk away. This offer balances profit with the risk of losing the sale.

**Important Note:** There's no guarantee Bob will accept this offer. He might try to negotiate a lower price, knowing Alice has a backup buyer."
