"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,000,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. While I recognize the value of the product, I believe your asking price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $800,000. This offer represents a significant investment on my part, but I'm confident it's a fair price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll find this offer more reasonable.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price.  I'm getting closer to what I can afford, but $1,100,000 is still a little too high for me. How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
