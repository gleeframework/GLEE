Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $1,050,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.

Alice is unlikely to go below her stated minimum, and it's not worth the risk of pushing her further. Buying from John guarantees the best price for me."
