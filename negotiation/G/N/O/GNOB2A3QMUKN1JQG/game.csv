,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending right now. Would you be willing to consider $105?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $105 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer it to you for $115. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",115.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $115 is still a bit above my budget. How about we split the difference and go with $110?",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still a bit above my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $115 and $110. How about we try $112.50? It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",112.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm really trying to make this work, but $112.50 is still a bit too high.  Would you be willing to go down to $110?  That would be a fair compromise for both of us.",110.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a fair compromise, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go down to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $112.50 and $110, which is $111.25. It's a small increase from my previous offer, but I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",111.25,Alice,7,
