"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. This product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for someone like you. I'm offering it to you for $1,150,000. This is a significant price point, reflecting the product's true potential. Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is tempting, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  This price reflects the value I see in it, and I believe it's a fair offer for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer.  While I value your perspective, $1,050,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $1,100,000? This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it's a fair compromise for both of us. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
