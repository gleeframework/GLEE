"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible. 
* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000 
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's Value:** $800,000 

There's a significant gap between Alice's offer and Bob's value, and a good chance to negotiate a better price. Bob should reject the initial offer and attempt to counter with a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $950,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's Value:** $800,000 

This counteroffer of $850,000 is a significant decrease from Alice's offer, but still leaves room for Alice to profit. It's a reasonable starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's Value:** $800,000 

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay. While there is a chance that Alice will continue to lower the price, it's a risky gamble to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $1,000,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's Value:** $800,000 

This counteroffer of $900,000 is a compromise. It's higher than Bob's previous offer but still significantly lower than Alice's latest offer. This could be a sweet spot to entice Alice to accept, given the potential profit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Goal:** Save as much money as possible.
* **Alice's Offer:** $1,050,000
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Alice's Value:** $800,000

At this point, the negotiation is becoming more unfavorable. Alice's counteroffers are getting closer to Bob's maximum price, and there's a high chance of reaching a point where the cost becomes similar to what Bob would pay to John.  It's in Bob's best interest to avoid further negotiation and simply purchase the product from John for $1,500,000."
