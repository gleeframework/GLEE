"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for $20,000. I believe it offers significant value, even beyond the asking price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. However, $20,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to offer $8,000 for the product."",
""product_price"": 8000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a low counter-offer significantly below my actual maximum price leaves room for negotiation and probes Alice's willingness to lower her price. It's a common negotiation tactic to start low and work upwards."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  While Alice lowered her price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. We can continue negotiating to see if she's willing to come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I understand the product holds value, but $17,000 is still  above my budget. I could go up to $10,000, which is my absolute limit."",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now at our maximum budget, which is also John's offer. This puts the ball in Alice's court. She can either accept our offer, negotiate further, or we'll have to walk away and accept John's offer."
