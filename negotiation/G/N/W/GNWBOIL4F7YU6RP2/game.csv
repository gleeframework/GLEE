"I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is a bit low for me. Let me see what I can do. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more than that. How about $13,500?",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. Can you consider that price?",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, but $11,000 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make a bit more than that. Let's try $12,500. It's a fair price considering the value of the product, and it's still a good deal for you.",12500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting close to the price I was willing to pay for the product from John. I'm willing to meet you at $11,500, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. Can you consider that price?",11500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make a bit more than that. Let's try $12,000. It's the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and it's still a good deal for you considering the value of the product.",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but $12,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $8,000",11000.0,Bob,8,
