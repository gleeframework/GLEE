Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $925,000. This offer is time-sensitive."",
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000, so there's room to negotiate above your minimum price ($800,000).
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $925,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially counter-offer while still securing a significant profit for you. 
* **Time Pressure:**  The mention of a time-sensitive offer adds a touch of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quickly.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. There's no guaranteed ""best"" offer, as Bob's response depends on factors you can't control."
