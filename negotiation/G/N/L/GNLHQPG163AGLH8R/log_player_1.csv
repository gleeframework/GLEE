Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but my budget is limited. I am willing to pay up to $750,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget. I am still looking for a more reasonable price. I am willing to pay up to $800,000 for the product. I hope this offers a closer alignment with its true value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could push for a slightly higher price, Bob landing at my minimum acceptable offer of $800,000 means further negotiation has minimal upside. Accepting this offer ensures a successful sale and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer in future rounds."
