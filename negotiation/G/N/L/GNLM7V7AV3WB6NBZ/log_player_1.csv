"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Attractive Offer:**  $175 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's significantly lower than his perceived value of $100. This makes it more likely he'll accept or counteroffer.
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm using a friendly and encouraging tone to build rapport."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting it would be a loss for me. 
* **Potential for negotiation:** While Bob's offer is low, it shows he's interested. I can use this to my advantage and counteroffer. 
* **Sell to John is an option:**  I'm aware I could sell to John for $150, but I want to see if I can get a better price from Bob. I still have several rounds to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 135} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  My counteroffer is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum.
* **Highlighting the value:**  I'm emphasizing that $135 is still a good deal for Bob, reminding him of the product's worth.
* **Positive and persuasive:**  I'm maintaining a friendly tone and expressing my desire to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $115. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  $115 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. Accepting would mean taking a loss.
* **Negotiation is key:**  While Bob's offer is closer, there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price.
* **Sell to John is a safety net:**  I'm aware I could sell to John for $150, but I want to exhaust all options with Bob first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to drop my price to $125. It's a fair offer, and it's getting us closer to a deal.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 125} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small concession:** I'm making a small concession, demonstrating my willingness to compromise while still staying above my minimum.
* **Focus on fairness:** I'm emphasizing that $125 is a fair offer, appealing to Bob's sense of equity.
* **Urgency & Closing:**  I'm using phrases like ""getting us closer to a deal"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit out of my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $120. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** While Bob's offer is getting closer, $120 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm not willing to settle for a loss.
* **Negotiation continues:**  I want to see if I can push Bob higher. I've made concessions, and he's shown interest. There's still room for a better offer.
* **John is always an option:** I know John is willing to pay $150, so I'm not desperate. This gives me leverage to continue negotiating with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I hear you and appreciate your offer.  $120 is getting very close, but I'm still just a bit off. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize this purchase.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 122.5} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small but Significant Increase:** I'm offering a small increase from Bob's offer, demonstrating I'm still willing to negotiate, but also pushing for a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **""Meet in the Middle"" Framing:** By suggesting a midpoint, I appeal to Bob's sense of fairness and make it seem like a compromise that benefits both of us.
* **Urgency and Optimism:**  I use phrases like ""finalize this purchase"" and ""make this happen"" to add a sense of urgency and highlight the possibility of a successful conclusion."
