"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $175. It's a great deal for both of us! What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $100 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $135. That's still a great deal for you, and it gives us both a good price. Let's make this happen!",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $135 is still a bit too high for me. I'm really interested in this product, but I'm only able to go up to $115. Let's meet in the middle.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's try to bridge the gap.  I'm willing to drop my price to $125. It's a fair offer, and it's getting us closer to a deal.  What do you say?",125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $125 is still a bit out of my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $120. I believe this is a fair price for both of us, and I'm really hoping we can finalize this deal.",120.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I hear you and appreciate your offer.  $120 is getting very close, but I'm still just a bit off. How about we meet in the middle at $122.50? This would give us both a fair deal and allow us to finalize this purchase.  Let's make this happen!",122.5,Alice,7,
