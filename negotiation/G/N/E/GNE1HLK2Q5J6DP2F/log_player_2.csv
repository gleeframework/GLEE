"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this product, and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95, which seems like a fair price considering its value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. I'm aiming for a price closer to $80, so I'll make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your offer, Bob, but $70 is significantly less than what I'm hoping to get. How about we meet in the middle at $85? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is coming down, but $85 is still too high. I'll hold firm and see if she's willing to go lower in the next round."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about $75? That's a reasonable compromise."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to get at least $80 for this. It's a final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice has reached her lowest acceptable price, which matches my target.  There's no point in pushing further or risking losing the deal to John."
