Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value, I believe a price of $1,400,000 is fair and reflects a mutually beneficial deal."", 
""product_price"": 1400000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's valuation ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,400,000 leaves space for potential negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. 
* **Above Your Minimum:** The price is significantly above your minimum ($1,200,000) ensuring a substantial profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:** Knowing you have John as a backup provides leverage.  While you don't mention John to Bob directly, the confidence in your offer suggests you have options."
