"Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",110.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $110 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $90?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $105. It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, $105 is closer to what I had in mind. How about we settle at $98?",98.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! However, $98 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I get a fair price. How about we meet at $108? It's a good deal for both of us, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
