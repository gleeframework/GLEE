"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's split the difference - I'll offer you the product for $9,500.  This is a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from the deal.",9500.0,Alice,3,
