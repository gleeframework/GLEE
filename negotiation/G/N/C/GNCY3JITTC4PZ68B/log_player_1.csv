Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
