Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."",
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob while ensuring he doesn't reject the offer.
* **John as a Safety Net:** Knowing John will buy the product for $150 guarantees Alice won't go below that price.
* **Finding a Balance:** Offering the product slightly below its value to Bob ($145) makes it appealing while still securing a profit for Alice. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between making the offer attractive to Bob and maximizing Alice's potential profit."
