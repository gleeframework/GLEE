Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 119
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to get as much money as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum acceptable price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While I could start at $120, offering it slightly lower at $119 might make Bob feel like he's getting a better deal and increase the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Avoid Losing the Sale:**  If I price too high, Bob might reject the offer, and I'll have to settle for $120 from John."
