"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $1,325,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",1320000.0,Alice,5,
