{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,400,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1300000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $1,350,000. This is my best price, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. What do you think?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's closer to his target, he can likely still get a better price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. However, $1,350,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you at $1,325,000. Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1325000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,325,000 is still a bit lower than I'd like. I'm willing to compromise and offer the product to you for $1,320,000. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,320,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,320,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob should accept Alice's offer. While he can still try to negotiate further, there's a chance Alice might not budge. Accepting at $1,320,000 is a good deal for him, and it's better than the $1,350,000 offer from the previous round.  The risk of continuing is that he might end up with a worse deal or have to buy from John at a higher price."
