"Bob, I have a fantastic product that I believe would be a great asset to you.  I understand its value to you and am willing to offer it at a price that's fair for both of us.  I'm asking for $11500. This is a significant discount from the true value, and I'm confident it will be a win-win for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts!",11500.0,Alice,1,
