"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid I won't be able to meet you at $850000. However, I'm willing to make a compromise. I can offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I've already offered you the best price I can, and I'm not willing to go any lower. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a 5-year warranty and a complimentary maintenance package, which will add significant value to the product. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $875000. This is my final offer.",875000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, I appreciate the extras you're offering, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $875000. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'll make one final offer of $870000, and I expect it to be accepted. If not, I'll have to explore other options.",870000.0,Bob,8,
