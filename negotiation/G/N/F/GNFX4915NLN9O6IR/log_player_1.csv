Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100} 
```

This offer is a good starting point because it:

* **Is higher than your minimum:**  You're asking for more than your minimum value, which is essential for profit.
* **Is lower than Bob's value:** This gives Bob a potential gain if he accepts the offer. 
* **Leaves room for negotiation:** If Bob balks at the price, you can always come down slightly, but you've still started strong."
