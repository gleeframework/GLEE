Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150, as it's a reasonable starting point that allows for negotiation while still being significantly above my minimum value. I'll see how Bob reacts and adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $100 is my minimum value, I'm not eager to sell at that price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm offering $125, a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  This shows flexibility while still ensuring I get a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $115 is getting closer to what I want, and I'm not sure I can get a significantly better deal.  It's better than selling to John for $100, so I'll accept."
