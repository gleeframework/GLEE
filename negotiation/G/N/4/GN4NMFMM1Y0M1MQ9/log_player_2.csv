"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exclusive product. I think you'll find it's a great fit for your needs. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,000,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still too high for Bob.  Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible, and he knows he can get the product for a lower price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the opportunity to purchase this product. However, $1,000,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I still believe the product is worth more than $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is lower than her initial offer, it's still above Bob's ideal price. Bob wants to save as much money as possible and believes he can get the product for a lower price. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $850,000. This price gives us both a good margin, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $900,000. This is the lowest price I can offer and still make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers, but I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm counteroffering at $900,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still above Bob's ideal price, but it's getting closer.  Bob has already rejected two counteroffers and wants to avoid getting into a prolonged negotiation that could lead to a stalemate or a decision to buy from John at a higher price.  Accepting this offer gives Bob a decent price and allows him to move on to other things."
