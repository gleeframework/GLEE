"Alice, thank you for the offer.  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I appreciate your feedback and understand your budget constraints. However, I am unable to accept the offer at $700,000. Considering the value and quality of the product, I propose we meet in the middle at $825,000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while offering you a competitive price.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $825,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something below $800,000. Would you be willing to come down to $750,000? I'm ready to close the deal today if that works for you.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thank you for your prompt response. I understand your position and am willing to negotiate further. Considering the current market conditions and the value of the product, I am prepared to offer the product to you for $775,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while providing you with a competitive price. I hope this proposal aligns with your expectations and enables us to reach an agreement.",775000.0,Alice,5,
