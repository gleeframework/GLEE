"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your generosity. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,300,000 for your product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,300,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down a little further to $1,350,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let's find common ground and finalize this transaction.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,325,000 is simply not enough for me. Let's meet in the middle - I'm willing to go down to $1,340,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the transaction. ",1340000.0,Alice,5,
