Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  $175 is higher than $100, meaning Bob has room to negotiate if he wants the product.
* **It's below your minimum:** $175 is still above your minimum of $150, so you're already making a profit.
* **It allows for negotiation:** This price gives Bob a reason to engage in conversation and try to get a lower price.

This strategy balances the need to maximize your earnings with the possibility of a successful negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $125 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is significantly lower than your minimum price.  While it's tempting to accept, rejecting allows you to try and get a better price. You can counter-offer with a price that's closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $125 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $150? This would still be a good deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 150}
```
This counteroffer is strategically chosen:

* **It's a compromise:** It's halfway between your previous offer and Bob's, showing you're willing to negotiate.
* **It's at your minimum:** It allows you to meet your minimum price while still potentially closing the deal with Bob.
* **It's fair:** You're proposing a price that benefits both of you, potentially leading to a successful negotiation."
