# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $8,000 to you, and Alice is asking for $9,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This still leaves me a small profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

While Alice's offer is closer to your desired price, it's still a bit high. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and our negotiation."", ""product_price"": 8000}
