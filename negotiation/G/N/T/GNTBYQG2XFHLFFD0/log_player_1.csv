"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you're confident in the product, but $9,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, it's still close enough to consider.  However, I'm hoping to get closer to my desired price.  Rejecting his offer will give me the chance to counter with a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $8,250.  This still leaves me a small profit margin, and it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $8,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's fair considering the product's value and our negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is exactly my minimum acceptable price, and it's a good deal for me considering the product's value and the limited time left in the negotiation.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer in the next round, and it's unlikely that I can convince Bob to go higher.  Accepting his offer ensures a smooth transaction and a solid return."
