"Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $80 to Alice, and she's asking for $90. This suggests she has room to negotiate.
* **You can likely get a better price.**  By rejecting her offer, you can make a counteroffer and potentially get a price closer to your target of $80.
* **Buying from John is not ideal.** While you're willing to pay $100, it's better to try and negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer is a compromise:**  This price is lower than Alice's offer but still above her perceived value of $80. 
* **It's reasonable:** This offer shows you're serious about buying the product while still trying to save money. 
* **It leaves room for further negotiation:**  If Alice rejects this offer, you can still counteroffer again, but you've shown you're willing to meet her halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is now within your acceptable range.**  You're willing to pay up to $100, and Alice is now offering the product for $87.
* **Further negotiation might not be worth it.** While you could try to negotiate a lower price, it's likely that Alice won't budge further. 
* **Accepting avoids the risk of losing the deal.**  If you reject Alice's offer and counteroffer again, there's a chance she'll walk away, and you'd have to buy from John at a higher price.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $13 compared to buying from John and get a good deal on the product."
