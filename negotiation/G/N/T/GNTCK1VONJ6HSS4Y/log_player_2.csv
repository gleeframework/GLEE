{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $14,000 is a better deal than John's $15,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob can try to get a lower price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $13,000, which is a $1,000 discount from Alice's initial offer. This is a reasonable counteroffer as it's still above Alice's $12,000 minimum. Bob is aiming to reach a price that is closer to his $12,000 limit while still being appealing to Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, it's still above his target.  Bob should continue to negotiate and try to get a lower price.  He still has the option of buying from John as a backup, so he can afford to be firm in his negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is again offering a compromise price, increasing his offer from $13,000 to $13,500. This is a slight concession to Alice, but still within Bob's budget and leaves some room for further negotiation. Bob is hoping that Alice will find this price agreeable and close the deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $15,000 is now the same as John's price.  There's no further benefit to negotiating with Alice.  Bob should accept John's offer to avoid further haggling and ensure he gets the product at his maximum price limit."
