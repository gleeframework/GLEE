Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $12,000.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is only worth $10,000 to Bob.
* **Your Safety Net:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John.

**Strategy**

The key is to offer a price that is attractive enough for Bob to consider, while still maximizing your profit.  Since you have a guaranteed buyer at your minimum price, you have leverage to start high.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique features and value, I'm proposing a price of $13,500. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and potential benefits."",
""product_price"": 13500
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  We start above Bob's perceived value and your minimum, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Confident Tone:**  The message highlights the product's value without being overly aggressive. 
* **Potential for Negotiation:** The price provides a cushion for you to potentially lower the price slightly if Bob negotiates, while still exceeding your $12,000 goal.

**Important Note:** There's always a chance Bob might outright reject the offer. However, with John as your backup, you're not pressured to accept any offer below your minimum price."
