"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product, and I think it's worth a lot to you. I'm willing to start at a price of $9,000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",9000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $8,500? That seems fair considering what it's worth to me, and it's still a good deal for you. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit on this deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750.  That's a fair compromise, and we can both walk away happy with the deal.  Let me know what you think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $8,750. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to think about the value this product holds for me. Let's try $9,250. It's a bit more than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle on this one.",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,250 is still a bit more than I'm prepared to pay. Let's meet in the middle at $9,000. It's a fair price, considering what it's worth to both of us. I think this would be a great way to close this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I think we're getting close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I'd like to try to get a bit more. Let's say... $9,200. I think it's a fair price, considering the value this product holds for you, and I'm willing to make it worth your while.",9200.0,Alice,7,
