"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but could you do better on the price? How about $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $120? It's a fair price, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny!",120.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  While $120 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Could you do $80? That would be a great deal for me.",80.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I really need to make a profit on this one. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get at least $140. Can we meet in the middle at $110?",110.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer, but $110 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about we split the difference between your last offer and mine and settle at $95?  That seems like a fair compromise to me.",95.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $130. It's still a bit of a stretch, but I'm willing to try to meet you halfway again. How about we try $127.50?",127.5,Alice,7,
