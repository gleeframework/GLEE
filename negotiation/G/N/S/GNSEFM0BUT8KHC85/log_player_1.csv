"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, given the value I place on this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still outside my range. I'm committed to purchasing this product but need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We are still significantly below John's offer. While Bob is moving in the right direction, there's room for more negotiation. We are aiming for a much higher price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your commitment to finding a solution.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable concession on my end while acknowledging the value you see in this product."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to making this work, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has met John's offer. There's no strategic advantage to continuing negotiations or waiting for a potentially higher offer from Bob. Accepting now secures the sale at the best possible price."
