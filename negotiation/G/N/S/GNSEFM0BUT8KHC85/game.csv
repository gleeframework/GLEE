"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing it further.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, your offer is significantly higher than my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $800,000 at this time. This is my absolute maximum, given the value I place on this product.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget considerations. However, $800,000 is significantly below its true value and what I'm willing to accept.  To move this forward, I can come down to $2,000,000. This is a substantial reduction and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution.",2000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $2,000,000 is still outside my range. I'm committed to purchasing this product but need to stay within my budget.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,200,000. This represents a significant compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value I place on the product.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're serious about acquiring this product, and I respect your commitment to finding a solution.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects a considerable concession on my end while acknowledging the value you see in this product.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,800,000 is still above my budget. I'm committed to making this work, but I need to stay within my financial limits. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,500,000. This is a substantial increase from my previous offer, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,6,
