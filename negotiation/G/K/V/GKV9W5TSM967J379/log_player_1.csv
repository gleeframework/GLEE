{""product_price"": 110}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $110. This price is higher than what it's worth to him, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  This gives Bob some room to negotiate while ensuring I get a good price."

I'm rejecting Bob's offer of $90.  While it's better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $100. This is a compromise, as it's lower than my initial offer of $110 but still higher than his offer of $90.  Hopefully, this will be acceptable to Bob, allowing us to close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell the product to John for $120.  While Bob's offer of $85 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, it's still below it. Given the opportunity to sell to John for my minimum price, I'm taking that option to ensure I get the best possible deal."
