"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to make a fair deal, but I'm on a tight budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

Bob's offer is too low. I know the product is worth more to him, and I have a backup offer from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but $90 is significantly below its value. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit tight on budget. How about we meet at $97.50? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json

```

While not ideal, $97.50 is still a reasonable profit above my minimum. It's better to take this offer than risk him walking away or engaging in further drawn-out negotiations."
