"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand it's a bit lower than my initial asking price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,250? It's a fair compromise, and it gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,750 for the product. It's a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",10750.0,Bob,4,
