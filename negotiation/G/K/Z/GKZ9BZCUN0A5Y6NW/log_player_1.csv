Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $700,000 for it.  What do you think?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $850,000? I'm serious about purchasing this product, and I think this would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer! I'm willing to stretch my budget to $875,000. This is a strong offer, and I believe it meets your need for a fair price while respecting my budget constraints.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $875,000

{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're halfway through the negotiation, and while Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly away from our desired price. There is a chance Bob might be willing to go higher, and we have John as a safety net."

Round 7

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  I'm willing to come up slightly to $890,000.  This is my final offer - I need to make a decision soon.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $890,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob has stated this is his final offer, and his price increases are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the next two rounds.  Accepting John's offer guarantees our desired price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away."
