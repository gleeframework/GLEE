"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer.  While $12000 is a step in the right direction, I'm still not quite there.  I'm willing to come down a bit further and offer you the product for $13500.  This represents a significant value for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let me know what you think!",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000 for the product. I think that's a fair price considering the value I'll get from it. Let me know if that's something you'd be willing to consider.",13000.0,Bob,4,
