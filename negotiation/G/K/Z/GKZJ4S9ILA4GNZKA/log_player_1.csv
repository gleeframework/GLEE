I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This gives me some room to negotiate if Bob counters. I'm also mindful of the fact that John is willing to pay $1,500,000, so I'm not leaving too much on the table."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is far too low. It's well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a more reasonable agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm countering with $1,750,000. This is still a significant profit for me and a fair price considering the value of the product. I'm hoping Bob will see this as a reasonable compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

```

Bob is clearly not willing to meet my minimum price. I've already made a significant concession in my counteroffer.  It's not worth risking further negotiation with Bob when I have a guaranteed buyer in John who is willing to pay $1,500,000.  I'll sell to John."
