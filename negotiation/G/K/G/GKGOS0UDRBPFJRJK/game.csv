"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. It's a rare and valuable item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $1200000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $900000. I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $900000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is my best offer at the moment, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1050000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950000. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1000000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm afraid $1000000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to walk away if we can't agree on a price. I'd like to make one final counteroffer of $920000. If this is not acceptable, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",920000.0,Bob,6,
