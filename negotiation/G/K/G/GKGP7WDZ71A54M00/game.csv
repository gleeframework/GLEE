"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your response.  I understand your perspective on the pricing.  While $650,000 is quite a bit below my initial asking price, I'm willing to move closer to your number in the spirit of negotiation. How about we consider $975,000? This feels like a fairer reflection of its inherent value.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. However,  $975,000 is still a bit too high for my budget.  Could we settle somewhere around $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,
