"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset that I know you're interested in, and this price reflects its worth. Let's make a deal! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. It's above his maximum budget, and he can likely get a better deal by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $1,100,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000 to facilitate this deal. It's still a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's still a bit higher than his initial counteroffer, it's within his budget and getting closer to his ideal price.  If he rejects, he risks Alice getting firmer on her price or even backing out of the deal entirely.  Buying from John at $1,200,000 is less favorable than this deal."
