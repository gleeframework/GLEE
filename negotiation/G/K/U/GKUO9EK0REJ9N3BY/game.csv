"Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $140?",140.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $140 is a bit too low for me. I can offer you the product for $155. This is still a great price considering its value, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. I'll make a counteroffer of $145. It's still within my budget and I hope we can reach an agreement.",145.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $145 is still below my bottom line. I'm offering $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?",150.0,Alice,5,
