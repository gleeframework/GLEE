Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm offering it to you for $170. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and gives me a good starting point to see if Bob is interested."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Could you consider reducing the price to $140? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for anything less than what I need to make.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but $145 is still below my bottom line. I'm offering $150, which is my absolute minimum.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit. Let's close this deal, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 150}
