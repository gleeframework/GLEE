{""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's a unique opportunity with immense potential. I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. My initial offer is $1,000,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's discuss what works best for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1000000 is a bit too high for me at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum threshold. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  While $750,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $900000 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $800000, which would be a fair price for both of us.  Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is at my minimum price threshold, and I've already established a strong negotiating position. Accepting his offer guarantees the best possible price for me in this round, avoiding the risk of further negotiation and potential for a lower price."
