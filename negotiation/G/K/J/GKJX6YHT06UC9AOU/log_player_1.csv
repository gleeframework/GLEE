"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a special introductory price of $120. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would you consider lowering the price to $100? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is offering the maximum of what the product is worth to him.  There's no room for negotiation to reach a price that's acceptable to me (above $100). Taking John's offer ensures I get my minimum desired price."
