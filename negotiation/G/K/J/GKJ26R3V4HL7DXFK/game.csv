"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,100,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I'm confident this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product and allowing both of us to walk away happy.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,125,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,110,000. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope you find this proposal reasonable.",1110000.0,Bob,4,
