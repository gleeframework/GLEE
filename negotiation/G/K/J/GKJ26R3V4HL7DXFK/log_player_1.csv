Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. It's a fair price considering its value to both of us. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1150000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate and feel like he's getting a good deal.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This allows for potential negotiation and ensures you don't immediately settle for John's offer. 
* **It's a clear and concise message:** It directly states the price and invites Bob to engage in further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I am interested in purchasing the product, but I can only afford to pay $1,100,000. I hope this proposal is acceptable to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

While $1,100,000 is a decent amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, aiming to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your budget constraints. However, $1,100,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? I'm confident this price is fair, reflecting the value of the product and allowing both of us to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer and while I understand the value of the product, I'm still not able to meet the price of $1,125,000. I would like to propose a price of $1,110,000. This allows me to stay within my budget while still acknowledging the product's worth. I hope you find this proposal reasonable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,110,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,110,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $1,110,000 is still slightly below my minimum, it's very close. Considering the risk of further negotiation leading to a stalemate and ultimately having to sell to John for $1,200,000, I'm willing to accept Bob's offer and secure a sale."
