,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! That's a bit higher than I was hoping for. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $100 for it right now. What do you think?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $100. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175, but I'm not budging below that. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $175 is still a bit high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $130. This is my final offer, as I'm not willing to go higher.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'll meet you at $155. That's the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a fair price for this amazing product.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $155 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $140, but that's the absolute highest I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to look elsewhere.",140.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think you're not serious about buying this product, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need you to meet me at a price that's closer to what I'm looking for. I'll meet you at $160, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",160.0,Alice,7,
