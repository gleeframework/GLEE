"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value for both of us. ",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $1,850,000? This reflects the significant value this product holds.",1850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
