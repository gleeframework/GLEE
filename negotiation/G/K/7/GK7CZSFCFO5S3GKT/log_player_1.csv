Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,250,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential value for both of us.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,200,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm open to finding a compromise.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand this product is valuable to you, but $1,850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's value to me and allows us both to make a deal.  Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $1,500,000 threshold I need. John offers a guaranteed sale at my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most financial sense to proceed with John."
