"Hi Bob, I have a great product that I think you'd be interested in. I'm asking for $115 for it. What do you think?",115.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Can you meet me at that price?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with the product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $107.50. Can you consider that?",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $107.50 just doesn't work for me. I'm willing to meet you one last time at $109.  This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm sorry, but $109 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there?",108.0,Bob,6,
