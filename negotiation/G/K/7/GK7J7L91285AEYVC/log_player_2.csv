{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's much too early to accept Alice's offer.  There's a lot of room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get a better price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3000}

I'm starting with a lower offer to see if Alice is willing to negotiate. $3000 is still a good price for me, and hopefully, it's low enough to pique her interest."

I'm still hoping to get a better deal than $4,000. I'll counter again and see if I can close the gap."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

I'm going to increase my offer a bit to show Alice I'm serious about buying the product. $3500 is a fair compromise, and hopefully, Alice will find it acceptable."

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Alice is moving very slowly, but I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'll counter again and see if I can get her closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 3800}
```

I'm going to increase my offer again, but only slightly. I want to show Alice that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not going to overpay.  $3800 is a good compromise and I'm hoping Alice will see that."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

We're getting close to my upper limit.  While I'd love to get it even lower, $4,500 is a good deal and I don't want to risk losing the opportunity.  It's still a significant saving over buying from John."
