"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its unique features and potential, I believe a starting price of $1,500,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price is way too high for me. I'm willing to pay $600,000 for the product. Let me know if that works for you.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and understand your perspective on the price.  While $1,500,000 represents its true value, I'm open to finding a compromise.  How about we meet halfway and agree on $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but that's still higher than what I had in mind. How about we settle at $700,000? I think that's a fair offer considering the value I see in it.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but need to stay above $1,000,000 for this to make sense for me.  Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. I'm getting closer to my limit, but I can go up to $750,000. If that works, we have a deal.",750000.0,Bob,6,
