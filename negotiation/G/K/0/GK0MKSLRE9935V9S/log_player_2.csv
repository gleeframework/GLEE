"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's potential to save more.  By rejecting the offer, Bob can explore if Alice is willing to go lower, potentially saving up to $50,000.  It's a gamble, but worth taking given Bob's goal of maximizing savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation.  $900,000 is a reasonable starting point, reflecting a substantial discount from Alice's initial offer.  This will gauge Alice's willingness to negotiate and set the stage for a potential middle ground."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $925,000, which is only $25,000 more than Bob's last counteroffer.  While there's still potential to negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or Bob having to pay the full $1,000,000 to John outweighs the potential savings. Accepting this offer secures the product at a good price, achieving Bob's goal of saving money."
