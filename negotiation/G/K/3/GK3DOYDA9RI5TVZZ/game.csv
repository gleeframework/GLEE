"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000?",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $18,000 is still a bit outside of my range. How about we settle at $12,000? It's a fair compromise that reflects the product's value to both of us.  Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,4,
