"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $22,000. I believe this is a fair starting point considering what you'll gain from it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $22,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $22,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

``` 
This is a clear case of a far too high offer. There's no reason to accept a price that's more than double your maximum.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's value, $22,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $8,000 for it, which is my maximum. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective.  While $8,000 is too low for me to consider, I'm willing to be flexible to find a compromise. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

$18,000 is still too high for Bob. The negotiation is moving in the right direction, but it's worth another counteroffer to see if Alice will budge further."
