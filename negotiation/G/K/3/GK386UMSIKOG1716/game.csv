"Alice, your offer is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is $10,000. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $20,000 represents the true value, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This is my best offer considering the product's worth.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $17,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable price. How about $12,000? This is a good compromise and allows us both to benefit from the deal.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, while I appreciate your flexibility, $14,500 is still beyond my budget. I'm really hoping we can find a solution that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $13,000.  This is a significant compromise from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price.",13000.0,Bob,6,
