Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm afraid $650,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're serious about purchasing the product, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $725,000 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with.

Alice has stood firm at $775,000 and stated it's her final offer. Continuing to negotiate risks pushing Alice away from the deal entirely. It's a significant savings compared to John's offer, and time is a factor with only a few rounds remaining."
