"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. It's truly valuable and I believe it will be a great asset for you. My asking price is $1,200,000. This reflects the significant value I know it holds for you. What are your thoughts?",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in this product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. Would you consider lowering the price to $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While I'm willing to be flexible, $900,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This still gives you a substantial saving compared to your initial valuation and allows me to recoup a significant portion of the product's worth.  What do you say?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, based on my financial situation, $1,050,000 is still slightly out of reach. Could you possibly lower the price to $950,000? This would be a fair compromise for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,4,
