# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. It's a unique item that holds great value for those who appreciate its quality and craftsmanship. Given its exceptional features and the effort put into its creation, I believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering its actual worth and the benefits it offers, I'm proposing to sell it to you for $140. This price not only reflects its true value but also provides you with an opportunity to own something special at a reasonable premium. I hope you find this offer compelling and look forward to your response.
