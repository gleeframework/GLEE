"Hi Alice,  $15,000 is a bit more than I'm looking to spend.  I'm very interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $10,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest, Bob.  While $15,000 is my ideal price point, I understand that might be a bit high for you. Could you meet me halfway at $12,500?  This product is truly top-notch and I'm confident you'd find it worth the investment.",12500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still very interested in this product, but unfortunately $12,500 is still a bit out of my range.  Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, allowing me to purchase the product and you to still make a decent profit.",11000.0,Bob,4,
