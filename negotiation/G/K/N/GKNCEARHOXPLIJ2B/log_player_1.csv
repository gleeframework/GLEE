Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** $1,000,000 (your guaranteed sale to John)
* **Bob's Value:** $1,500,000 
* **Potential Profit for Bob:** $500,000 ($1,500,000 - $1,000,000)

**Strategy**

You want to capture as much of that potential profit for Bob as possible while ensuring he still sees value in the deal. Offering a price slightly below his perceived value will likely clinch the sale.

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to acquire the product. Given its potential value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I propose a price of $1,300,000, reflecting its worth and our strong business relationship."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Confident Tone:**  Sets a positive tone for negotiation.
* **Emphasis on Value:**  Highlights the product's benefits to Bob, justifying the price.
* **Strategic Price:**  Leaves Bob with a $200,000 potential profit, making it highly likely he'll accept.
* **Relationship Building:**  Mentioning a ""strong business relationship"" adds a personal touch.

**Important Note:**  This is just one approach. Depending on your negotiation style and any prior knowledge about Bob, you might adjust the price and message."
