"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can do better than $950,000.  Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000, and you're willing to pay up to $1,000,000.  There's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer splits the difference between Alice's minimum and your maximum. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation, and leaves room for Alice to counter if she needs to."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to your price, it's still higher than your ideal price point. You can likely still negotiate a lower price, and  $975,000 is still closer to your maximum than to Alice's minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly not willing to go as low as $850,000. This counteroffer moves the price closer to her last offer, while still leaving some room for negotiation. It's a good compromise that shows you are serious about buying the product but still want to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $985,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $985,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly unwilling to budge much further. Her offer is getting closer to your maximum price point, and you've already rejected her counteroffer twice. While you could continue to negotiate, it's unlikely you'll get significantly lower. 

Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a known quantity and saves you from further negotiation with Alice.  While it's not the ideal price, it's still within your budget and a reasonable outcome."
