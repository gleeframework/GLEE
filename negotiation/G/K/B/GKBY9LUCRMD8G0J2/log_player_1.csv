Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,250,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to get more than your minimum of $1,200,000.
* **It's not too aggressive:**  Starting too high could scare Bob off.
* **It's open to negotiation:** You've left room for Bob to counter-offer.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit, but also to keep the negotiation going.  Be prepared to adjust your offer based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I believe we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. Would you consider selling the product for $1,150,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $1,150,000 is still a decent amount, it's below your minimum desired price and you have a guaranteed offer from John for $1,200,000.  It's worth pushing for a better price with Bob, as you have leverage with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer.  While I understand your position, $1,150,000 is a bit too low for me at this time.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but I need to stay above $1,200,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we settle at $1,225,000? This is a fair compromise and would allow us both to walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 1225000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I've carefully considered your proposal, and I believe we can still work towards a solution that benefits both parties. Could you consider selling the product for $1,210,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $1,210,000 is only $10,000 less than John's offer. It's not a significant difference, and it's likely Bob won't go higher.  It's better to accept this offer and close the deal, rather than risk losing both Bob and John by continuing to negotiate."
