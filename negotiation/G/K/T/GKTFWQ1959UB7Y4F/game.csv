"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,250? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget.",10250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,250. However, that's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $12,000. Would you consider $11,500? This would be a good middle ground for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $10,750? It's the highest I can go without breaking my budget.",10750.0,Bob,6,
