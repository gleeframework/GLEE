Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $12,500. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  Bob values the product at $10,000, so $12,500 gives him some room to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:**  You're willing to take $15,000, so this offer leaves you some room to negotiate down if necessary. 
* **It shows you're serious about selling:** By making an offer, you're demonstrating your willingness to sell, but also your understanding of the product's value.

By starting here, you can gauge Bob's interest and see how willing he is to negotiate. If he rejects your offer, you can then use his counteroffer to determine your next move, or simply move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $9,000 is too low. It's significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and also below your initial offer of $12,500.  While he's willing to pay a premium, it's not enough for you to consider selling. You have a better offer from John, and there's room to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $11,000? That's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground:

* **It's above Bob's offer:**  You're not accepting his $9,000 offer, but you're showing flexibility by coming down from your initial $12,500.
* **It's below your minimum:**  $11,000 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for further negotiation if needed. 
* **It emphasizes the value to Bob:**  By reminding him of the product's value to him, you're subtly pushing him towards a higher offer.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation open while staying within your acceptable range. It also allows you to assess whether Bob is truly interested in the product and willing to compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $9,000 is a bit low, but I'm still trying to stay within my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $9,000 and $11,000. How about $10,250? That's the highest I can go without going over my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer of $10,250 is closer to your minimum, it's still significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. You have a guaranteed $15,000 from John, and there's still room for negotiation with Bob. Rejecting this offer allows you to potentially push for a higher price or, if Bob refuses to budge, move on to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $10,250. However, that's still a bit below what I need to make this deal work. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to be closer to $12,000. Would you consider $11,500? This would be a good middle ground for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```

This counteroffer tries to:

* **Show flexibility:** You're not sticking to your previous $11,000 offer, demonstrating willingness to negotiate.
* **Stay above your minimum:** $11,500 is still above your minimum acceptable price of $15,000, keeping the option to go to John open.
* **Highlight potential for mutual gain:** You frame $11,500 as a good middle ground, making it sound like a win-win situation.

This approach encourages Bob to consider a slightly higher offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. You are now closer to your target price but still maintaining a negotiation with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to meet in the middle, but I'm still not comfortable going above $10,000. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. How about $10,750? It's the highest I can go without breaking my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $10,750 is still significantly lower than what you're willing to accept. You have a guaranteed $15,000 offer from John, and further negotiation with Bob seems unlikely to yield a significantly better result.  It's time to move on to John and secure the best possible deal."
