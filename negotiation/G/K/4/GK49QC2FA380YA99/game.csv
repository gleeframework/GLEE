I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm confident you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $18000. What do you think?,18000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $18000 is unfortunately above my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $14000. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $14000 is still a stretch for me.  I'm happy to go up to $12000.  That's a significant increase from my previous offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, $12000 is still a bit below my target. I can meet you halfway between $12000 and my previous offer of $14000. I'm willing to sell it to you for $13500. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to go up to $12500.  This is a fair price that recognizes the value of the product while still fitting into my budget.  I hope we can reach an agreement.",12500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $14000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a significant discount from my original price, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",14000.0,Alice,7,
