"Alice, $18,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $12,000.  What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is closer to the value this product provides.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still stuck at $12,000. It's my absolute limit for this purchase.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing you're really serious about this product, and I want to make a deal. Let's try $13,500 - it's a final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $13,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to walk away if we can't find a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference at $12,750? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will be worth it for you in the long run.",12750.0,Bob,6,
