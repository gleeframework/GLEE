"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking to keep my investment within $800,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $1,000,000? I appreciate your consideration.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my previous offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to lower the price, I still aim to stay within my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I hope this brings us closer to reaching an agreement that suits both of our needs.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm motivated to find a solution, $1,200,000 is still a significant gap from where I see this product's value.  My final offer is $1,600,000. This represents a considerable compromise on my end, and I believe it's more than fair considering the product's potential.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
