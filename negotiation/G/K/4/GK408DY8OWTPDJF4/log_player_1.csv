Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the significant benefits it offers. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** I'm starting with a strong offer that leans towards the higher end of the potential profit margin (Bob's valuation minus my valuation). This leaves room for negotiation if needed while aiming for the best possible outcome.
* **Justification:** By highlighting the product's value specifically to Bob (""someone with your expertise""), I'm creating a stronger argument for the high price.
* **Open to negotiation:** The tone remains collaborative (""I believe this is fair..."", ""What do you think?"") signaling to Bob that I'm open to discussing the price further.

This approach aims to secure a deal close to Bob's maximum valuation while acknowledging his right to negotiate. If Bob rejects this initial offer, there's still a cushion to go lower while staying above John's guaranteed offer."
