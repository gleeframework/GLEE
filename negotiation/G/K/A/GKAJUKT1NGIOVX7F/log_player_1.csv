``` 

This offer is a starting point.  It's a bit lower than the $10,000 value to Bob, but still gives me a healthy profit.  I'm also friendly and open to negotiation in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $9,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $9,000 is still a good profit for me, I believe I can do better. I'm going to counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer to see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $9,250 is my best price.  This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can make this work!"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $9,100 as my maximum offer for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer.  $9,100 is close to my ideal price, and I don't want to risk losing the deal and having to settle for John's $8,000 offer.  It's important to be flexible in negotiations, and I'm happy to close the deal at this price."
