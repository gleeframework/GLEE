"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm looking for a quick sale. Given that, I'm offering it to you at $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $20,000 is way above my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $8,000.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  $20,000 was a bit ambitious, I'll admit.  However,  $8,000 is way too low for me. To be fair, how about we meet in the middle at $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $14,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to get a good deal. Let's make it happen.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you moving closer to a price that works for both of us.  How about we split the difference and call it $12,000? That's a very good price for what you're getting.",12000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $12,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",9000.0,Bob,6,
