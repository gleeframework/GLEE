Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,300,000."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to get at least $800,000 (your guaranteed offer from John).
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Setting the price at $1,300,000 aims to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on the product while still leaving Bob with a potential gain of $200,000. 

This strategy attempts to strike a balance between a high price that Bob might reject and a lower price that leaves more potential profit on the table."
