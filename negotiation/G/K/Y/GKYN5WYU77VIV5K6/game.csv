"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested, but $140 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $110?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $110 is too low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $125?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. ",125.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground, Alice. How about $115?  That's a fair price, and I'd be happy to close the deal at that.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $115 just isn't going to work for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $120?  That's a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to cover my costs. Let me know what you think.",120.0,Alice,5,
