"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if you're interested and we can move forward with the details. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  My first counteroffer needs to be significantly below Alice's asking price to give room for negotiation.
* **Not Too Low:**  Going too low might insult Alice and make her less willing to bargain. This offer is a 25% decrease from her initial offer, which is substantial but not outrageous. 
* **Targeting Savings:** My goal is to save as much as possible from my $1,200,000 maximum.  This offer leaves me with a good cushion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,400,000 might be a bit high for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $1,200,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is Moving:** Alice dropped her price by $100,000, indicating she's willing to negotiate.
* **Room for Improvement:** While her offer is closer, it's still $100,000 more than I'm willing to pay John.
* **Leverage:**  I know my walk-away point, and it seems Alice is motivated to sell. I'll push a little further before considering John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $1,300,000 is closer, but to make this work, I'd need to see a price closer to $1,150,000.  That feels like a fair compromise to me."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference (Almost):** Alice came down $100,000, so I'm countering with a $150,000 decrease. This shows I'm willing to move towards her, but I'm also holding firm on getting a significant discount.
* **Staying Below John:** My offer keeps me safely under the $1,200,000 I'd pay John. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This offer will gauge Alice's flexibility. If she's unwilling to budge much from here, I may have to concede or go with John."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking for a fair compromise, and I appreciate your willingness to work with me. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $1,250,000. This is the best I can do, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Stalemate:** Alice has split the difference twice now, indicating she's unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000. 
* **Minimal Gain:**  While Alice's offer is tempting, it's only a $50,000 savings compared to John's price.
* **Time Value:**  Further negotiation with Alice carries the risk of her becoming firm at her current price or me losing the opportunity to buy from John.

It's not worth the potential hassle and minimal savings. John's offer is solid and guarantees me the product at my target price."
