Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it holds immense value for your operations, and I'm confident you'll find it worthwhile. I'm initially offering it at $1,500,000.  What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{
 ""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's important to remember your bottom line. You value the product at no less than $1,200,000, and John is offering that price right now.  There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Bob will result in a better outcome, and it introduces risk. Accepting John's offer ensures you get a fair price without the uncertainty of prolonged negotiation."
