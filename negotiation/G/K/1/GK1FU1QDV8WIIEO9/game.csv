"Alice, $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and my budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000. This is a very fair price considering the value of the product and the fact that I'm already making a significant concession. This is my final offer,  let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1450000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If you reject it, I will need to buy the product from John instead. ",1400000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's finalize this deal now.",1425000.0,Alice,7,
