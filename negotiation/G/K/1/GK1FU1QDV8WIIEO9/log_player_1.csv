"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,750,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1750000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but lower than my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness Appeal:**  I'm using language like ""fair price"" to try and get Bob to consider my offer seriously. 
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm inviting Bob to respond, indicating a willingness to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, $1,750,000 is way above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for your product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value of the product to me.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:** While Bob's offer is a significant increase from his initial valuation, it's still well below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Opportunity:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get closer to my target price by making a counteroffer.
* **Avoiding Selling to John:**  While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000,  I'm still hopeful I can get more from Bob through negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000.  This is a significant concession from my original offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer, but still above my minimum price. This shows I'm willing to compromise. 
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to justify my price.
* **Finality:** I'm using language like ""find common ground"" to suggest that this might be my final offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $1,600,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,300,000.  This is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product to me and my budget constraints.  Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:**  Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.
* **Negotiation Continues:**  While the gap is narrowing, I'm not yet ready to accept. I believe there's still room to negotiate upwards.
* **John as Backup:**  I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net, but I want to exhaust all possibilities with Bob first."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,300,000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,450,000.

This is my final offer,  let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is a strong indication that I'm serious about closing the deal, but I still have room to maneuver.
* **Meeting Halfway:**  I'm showing that I'm trying to find a compromise while keeping the price above my minimum.
* **Emphasizing Fairness:**  I'm reiterating the value of the product and the concessions I've already made to justify my price.
* **Closing the Deal:**  I'm emphasizing that this is my final offer to push Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,400,000. This is my final offer. If you reject it, I will need to buy the product from John instead.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  Bob's offer is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  However, I still believe I can get a slightly better deal. 
* **Finality:**  While Bob claims this is his final offer, I'm not convinced. He's likely trying to pressure me into accepting.
* **One More Counteroffer:** I have a few rounds left, and I'm confident I can push for a higher price.  If I can get Bob to go up to $1,450,000, it's worth the risk. 
* **John's Offer:** I'm still keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net. If this deal falls through, I can always go to John."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  $1,400,000 is simply too low. I'm willing to accept $1,425,000. This is my absolute final offer. If you're serious about buying the product, let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 1425000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This is my final offer, and it's a small but significant increase from Bob's last offer. It shows flexibility while still staying above my minimum.
* **Time Pressure:** I'm emphasizing the ""final offer"" aspect to create pressure and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Seriousness:**  I'm stressing seriousness to emphasize that I'm close to going to John.
* **Closing the Deal:** I'm using direct language like ""finalize this deal now"" to push Bob towards accepting."
