"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $6,000.  Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. I think this is a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. However, $12,000 is still a bit more than I'm looking to spend. Would you consider $7,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're really interested in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. I can do $9,500. It's a fair price that still allows me to make a profit, and I think it's a great opportunity for you to get a great deal. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,5,
