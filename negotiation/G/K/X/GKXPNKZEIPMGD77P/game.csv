"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice, but I'm not quite comfortable with the initial price. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it can bring to your operations.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your perspective, Alice, but I still feel that $1,900,000 is too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget.",1700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly recognizing the value this product offers. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,800,000?  This feels like a fair price that acknowledges both our positions.",1800000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to find a middle ground, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,800,000. I'm willing to make another counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value and my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,6,
