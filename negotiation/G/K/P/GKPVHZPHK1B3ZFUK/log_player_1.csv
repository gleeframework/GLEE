"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll be happy with it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. This ensures I'm maximizing my profit while keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to pay $90 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $90 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $105.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105, which is still above Bob's initial offer but closer to his perceived value of $100. This shows flexibility while maintaining my profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit away from $105. I'd be willing to pay $95 for it, but that's as low as I can go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is tempting, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'm going to reject Bob's offer again and try to push for a higher price. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to negotiate, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $100, which is still a great deal for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm sticking with my strategy of gradually decreasing the price while keeping it above Bob's offers. This shows flexibility while ensuring I don't lose too much profit.  I believe $100 is a fair compromise for both of us."
