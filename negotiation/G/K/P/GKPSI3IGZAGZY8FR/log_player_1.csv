Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,450,000.  Let me know your decision soon, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a strong position. Offering it to Bob slightly below that at $1,450,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding your minimum.
* **Sense of Urgency and Value:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity while creating a sense of urgency by mentioning ""other interested parties."" This encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your strong offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial price is high, there's a slight margin for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer. This allows for some flexibility without jeopardizing your profit significantly."
