Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $140. I know you'll find it valuable."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Starting at $140 aims to capture the majority of the value difference between what you're willing to accept ($120) and what Bob is willing to pay ($150). 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  While you don't want to go below $120, a slightly higher initial offer leaves space for Bob to negotiate, potentially feeling like he got a better deal.
* **Avoiding a Lost Sale:** If you start too high (close to $150), Bob might reject the offer outright. This strategy increases the chance of a successful sale while still securing a significant profit."
