"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a decent deal, it's still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you offering me the product, but $9,500 is a little outside of my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the value of the product to me."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I have to consider the value the product holds for me as well. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,000. This is my final concession for now. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save as much money as possible. While $9,000 is closer to his ideal price point, he's still willing to negotiate further. He can likely secure a better deal by making another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I recognize the value you place on the product, $9,000 is still a bit steep for me.  I'm prepared to offer $8,750.  This represents a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair offer that allows us both to come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I can see you're serious about acquiring the product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,250. This is a compromise that I hope will meet you in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still trying to save money. While Alice is coming down in price, she's still above Bob's ideal price point. It's worth trying to negotiate further before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to get closer to your target price. However, $9,250 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to offer $8,875. This is a significant compromise on my part and a good starting point for us to finally reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 8875}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where it's more beneficial for me to consider other options. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'm now offering the product to you for $9,375. This is my final concession, and I expect it to be a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,375. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,375
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is getting closer to his ideal price, but Alice's offer of $9,375 is still a bit high.  With only 3 rounds remaining, Bob needs to consider the risk of not reaching an agreement with Alice.  It's likely that Alice will stick to her final concession, and further negotiations could be unproductive. Given the limited time and the potential for deadlock, Bob decides to accept the offer from John, which guarantees him the product within his budget."
