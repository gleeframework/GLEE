Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 10000} 
```

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:**  You've stated your minimum is $8,000, so $10,000 is a good starting point.
* **It's below Bob's value:** Bob values the product at $12,000, so he has room to negotiate and still get a good deal.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's space to move up or down in price if Bob counteroffers.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting a good price and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is better than selling to John, there's still room to push for a higher price.  Bob clearly values the product at more than $9,500. 

Rejecting his offer allows me to counter and potentially secure a price closer to my ideal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9750} 
```

This counteroffer is a compromise:

* **It's higher than Bob's offer:** This shows I'm willing to negotiate but still want a better price.
* **It's lower than my initial offer:** This demonstrates flexibility and signals that I'm ready to close the deal. 

This tactic aims to find a middle ground and encourage Bob to accept while keeping the negotiation moving towards a more favorable outcome for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

At this point, it's in my best interest to accept Bob's offer.  Here's why:

* **Slightly better than John's offer:**  $9,600 is a significant improvement over the $8,000 I'd get from John.
* **Negotiation fatigue:**  We've gone back and forth a few rounds, and it's unlikely Bob will budge much further.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  If I continue to counteroffer and Bob rejects again, I risk him walking away, leaving me with only John's offer. 

Accepting Bob's offer secures a good price and avoids the potential for further negotiation delays or a worse outcome."
