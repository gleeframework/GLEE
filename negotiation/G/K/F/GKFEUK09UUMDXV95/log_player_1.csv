"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $130. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $130 feels a bit high for me. Would you consider $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $105 is better than selling to John, I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price of $130. I'll try to counter with a slightly lower price than my original offer, but still higher than Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $120.  It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you coming down a bit, Alice.  I'm getting closer to my budget. How about $110? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $110 is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe I can get closer to my target of $120. I'll make another counteroffer, but I'll be prepared to accept his next offer if it's close enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $115? It's still a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
