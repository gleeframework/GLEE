"I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for it.  What do you think?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a budget, Bob, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's worth every penny.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $12,000?  That's a fair price for both of us and would allow me to make this purchase.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I think $13,000 is my absolute minimum. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it's worth it.",13000.0,Alice,5,
