"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $175, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit out of my price range. I'm looking to spend closer to $60 for the product. Would that work for you?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your interest, $60 is quite a bit lower than my minimum. How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $105?  I'm confident you'll find it worth the investment.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle.  While $105 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit higher than my budget allows. Could you do $75?",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $75 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle again at $90?  This would give you a good deal, and it would work for me. Let me know what you think.",90.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $90 is getting closer, but I'm really trying to stay closer to $80. Would you be willing to meet me there?",80.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and $80 is definitely closer.  I'm willing to go down to $85.  This is a good deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.  What do you say?",85.0,Alice,7,
