"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10,500. This is a fair price considering its worth to you is $8,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While the product is worth $8,000 to him, Alice's offer of $10,500 is still too high.  He has room to negotiate and can likely get a better price.  He can also choose to buy from John for $8,000 if the negotiation with Alice doesn't go well."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $10,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product.  This is a fair price considering its value to me and leaves room for you to make a profit."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,800. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still leaves a decent profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still above his target of $8,000.  Since he has the option of buying from John for $8,000, there's no reason to accept Alice's offer at this point.  He should continue to negotiate for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  I appreciate you coming down in price, but $9,800 is still a bit high for me.  How about $9,200? That's a good compromise, and we can both walk away happy."", ""product_price"": 9200}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,200. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,500. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still leaves a decent profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to Bob's ideal price, it's still higher than the $8,000 he can get from John.  Since there are still rounds left, Bob should continue to negotiate for a lower price.  He can likely get a better deal, especially since Alice is willing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit too much for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,300 for the product.  This is a fair offer considering its value to me and leaves you with a reasonable profit.  Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9300}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your persistence, Bob, but I'm not willing to go down to $9,300. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,600. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still leaves a decent profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,600
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is only $400 more than what John is selling for, Bob has a few reasons to keep negotiating:

* **He's already shown he's willing to walk away:**  By not accepting Alice's previous offers and choosing to counteroffer, Bob has demonstrated his willingness to walk away. This gives him leverage.
* **There's a chance Alice might budge:** It's possible she's getting closer to her minimum acceptable price.  He should see if he can get her down further.
* **Time is on his side:**  With only three rounds left, there's less pressure on Bob to accept.  He can continue to negotiate with Alice and still buy from John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting close. I'm willing to go to $9,400 for the product. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. Let's finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 9400}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $9,400, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $9,700. This is a fair price considering its value to you and still leaves a decent profit for me. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,700. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,700
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob has only one round left to negotiate with Alice, and her offer of $9,700 is still $1,700 more than what he can buy it from John for.  There is no reason to take the risk of continuing to negotiate and potentially ending up with no deal at all. He should accept the guaranteed price from John and move on."
