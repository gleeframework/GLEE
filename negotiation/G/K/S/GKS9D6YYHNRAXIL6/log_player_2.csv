"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to let it go for $130. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

The product is worth $120 to Alice, so there's room for negotiation. We can try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less.  How about $125?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 125}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to save a bit, Bob. I can do $135, but I'm not willing to go any lower than that. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $135
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice's offer of $135 is still a good deal for me, as it's less than what I'd pay John ($150).  It's also closer to my target price than her previous offer.  I'll accept this offer."
