"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this unique product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15000. Is this something you'd like to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $12,000. It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can get a better price. You have 10 rounds, so there's room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $13,000 is closer to your budget, it's still above your ideal price point. It's worth trying to push for a lower price, especially since you have more rounds left. You can attempt to negotiate further and see if you can get closer to your target of $12,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down to $13,000, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $12,500?  I'm serious about buying this product and believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I'm still not willing to go any lower. I'm going to throw in an additional incentive - I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1000 with the purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500 now? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $12,500 is within your budget, the added incentive of a $1000 maintenance package isn't a strong enough reason to accept. You're still $500 above your ideal price point. It's worth trying to push for a lower price. It's likely Alice is willing to negotiate further, especially since you have multiple rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the free maintenance package offer, but I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. I'm happy to take the product at $12,000, which is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in an additional incentive, a 1-year warranty, which is valued at $2000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $12000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. The price remains at $12000 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $12,000 is your target price, and the additional incentive of a 1-year warranty valued at $2000 makes it a very good deal. While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice will walk away, and you'll have to settle with John's offer of $12,000 without the warranty. It's better to secure the deal now and get the additional benefit of the warranty."
