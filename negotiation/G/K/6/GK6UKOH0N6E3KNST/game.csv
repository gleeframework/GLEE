,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $11000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $13000, which is the lowest price I'm willing to go. Is this something you'd be interested in?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you coming down to $13000, Alice. However, I'm still not quite there.  Would you consider $12500?  I'm serious about buying this product and believe this price is fair for both of us.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12500, but I'm still not willing to go any lower. I'm going to throw in an additional incentive - I'll include a free maintenance package worth $1000 with the purchase. Would you be willing to meet me at $12500 now?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the free maintenance package offer, but I'm still looking to get the best deal possible. I'm happy to take the product at $12000, which is my final offer.  If this doesn't work, I'll need to go with John's offer.",12000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $12000. I'll tell you what - I'll throw in an additional incentive, a 1-year warranty, which is valued at $2000. This is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at $12000, I'm afraid I'll have to consider other options. The price remains at $12000",12000.0,Alice,7,
