Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a great deal and would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good negotiation tactic to start with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Gauging Interest:** Bob's reaction to this initial offer will give you valuable information about his level of interest and potential for negotiation. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $12,000, so you're not desperate. This allows you to be firm in your negotiation with Bob.

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, be prepared to negotiate. You can gradually lower your price, but always keep your $12,000 safety net in mind."
