"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price of $1,350,000 falls a bit short of what I had in mind. Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,375,000? This reflects the true value of the product and its potential benefits for you.",1375000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but my ultimate goal here is to reach a mutually beneficial agreement. While $1,325,000 is a bit too low for me to accept, I'm willing to consider a price of $1,360,000. This reflects a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",1360000.0,Alice,5,
