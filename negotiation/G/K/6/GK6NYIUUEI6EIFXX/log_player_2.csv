"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to own this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the potential of this product, your initial price is unfortunately higher than my current budget.

```"

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer and understand your perspective on the value.  However, the price you're offering doesn't reflect the true worth of this product and the potential returns it offers. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $1,350,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget, even after meeting me ""halfway.""  While it's closer, I'm not comfortable paying over $1,100,000 at this point. There's still room for negotiation and I'll try to lower the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $1,350,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $1,150,000. This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my budget. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your persistence in this negotiation. Let's find a point we can both agree on.  I'm willing to come down to $1,275,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, but I believe in finding a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than before, it's still above my maximum budget of $1,000,000.  I'm getting closer, but I'm not ready to commit yet. I'll continue to negotiate and see if I can get a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $1,275,000 is still outside my budget. I'm prepared to offer $1,200,000, which is a significant step for me. This price reflects the true value I see in the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
