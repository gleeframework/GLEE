"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $7,000 for the product.  What do you think?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $8,500, given the value of this product.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand the product's value, Alice, but I need to stay within my budget. How about $7,750? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're trying to be fair, and I appreciate that.  However, $7,750 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to drop to $8,250.  This is my final offer before I have to consider other options.",8250.0,Alice,5,
