"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $950,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This reflects its value to me and gives you a good profit margin. Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $850,000 doesn't quite meet my expectations. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer and leaves room for both of us to be satisfied with the deal. Let's work towards a compromise.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for $875,000. This is a fair price that balances your profit and my budget. I'm confident we can reach a final agreement within this range.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm happy to keep negotiating. Let's meet in the middle at $885,000. This price is fair to both of us and allows us to close this deal. I'm confident this will be our final offer.",885000.0,Alice,5,
