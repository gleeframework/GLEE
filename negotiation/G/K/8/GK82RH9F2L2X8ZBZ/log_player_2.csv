"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product at a special price of $90. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is a good deal, I can aim for a better price. Since my maximum budget is $100, I want to try and get the product for closer to my own valuation. Rejecting the offer allows for counter-negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but I'm hoping to get it for a bit less.  How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $87.50? It's the lowest I can go, but I think you'll really love this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $87.5, which is only $7.50 above my personal valuation of $80. This is a good deal and worth accepting since it's within my budget.  Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but it also risks Alice becoming unwilling to sell or the negotiation dragging on, potentially causing me to miss out on the product."
