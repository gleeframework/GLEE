"Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate you highlighting the uniqueness of the product, but $15000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $10000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $10000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $12500. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $12500 is still a bit higher than what I'm comfortable with.  How about $11500?  I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget.",11500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $11500 is still a bit higher than you're comfortable with, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11000. I can meet you halfway between $11500 and $11000, which is $11250. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
