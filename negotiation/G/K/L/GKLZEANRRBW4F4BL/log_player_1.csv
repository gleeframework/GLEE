Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting with a price of $20,000, knowing that the product is worth at least $15,000 to me. This sets a high benchmark and leaves room for negotiation.
* **Testing the waters:** I need to gauge Bob's interest and potential willingness to pay. This initial offer allows me to gather information without risking a deal-breaker.
* **Alternative option:**  I have John as a fallback, which gives me more leverage.  If Bob rejects the offer, I can assess his counteroffer and decide if it's worthwhile to continue negotiating or move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $10,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. Accepting this offer would result in a significant loss for me.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** Bob's offer shows he's interested in the product. Rejecting his offer allows me to counter with a more reasonable price, potentially leading to a mutually beneficial deal.
* **John is a safety net:** Even though I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I have John as a fallback option, ensuring I can still sell the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm countering with $17,500, which is halfway between my initial offer ($20,000) and Bob's offer ($10,000).  This demonstrates flexibility and shows that I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Maintaining a profit:**  This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, ensuring I can still make a profit.
* **Testing Bob's seriousness:** By offering a price closer to his initial offer, I'm testing his seriousness and whether he's willing to come up to a more acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Close to my minimum:**  While $12,500 is closer to my minimum price of $15,000, it's still not a particularly good deal for me. I've already lowered my price twice, and I'm not confident that Bob will budge significantly higher.
* **Time is valuable:**  Continuing to negotiate could take more time and effort, and I'm not sure if the potential gain justifies the risk. 
* **John offers a sure thing:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and saves me the hassle of further negotiation with Bob. This is the most reliable and efficient choice for me."
