"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $1,000,000 to you. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Alice's offer of $800,000 is significantly less than your $1,000,000 maximum and the $1,000,000 John is offering. Accepting this offer saves you a considerable amount of money."
