"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out. While the product looks great, $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $8,500 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,250?  It's still a fair price for both of us.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,250 is closer, but I'm still aiming for a price closer to $8,500.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,875? It's a fair price for both of us and keeps us moving towards a deal.",8875.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm happy to keep working towards a deal.  Let's compromise again.  How about $9,000?  That's a fair price considering the value of the product and gives us both a win.",9000.0,Alice,5,
