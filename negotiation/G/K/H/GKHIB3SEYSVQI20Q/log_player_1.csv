Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm asking for $170 for it. Let me know what you think!"", 
""product_price"": 170
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($80) and my minimum acceptable price ($150). This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows me to secure a higher profit. 
* **""Anchoring"" Effect:**  By starting high, I'm trying to influence Bob's perception of the product's value. Even if he doesn't accept the initial offer, it might make a slightly lower counter-offer seem more reasonable to him.
* **Backup Plan:** I have a guaranteed buyer (John) for $150. This gives me leverage in the negotiation, as I'm not desperate to sell below my minimum. 

**Important Note:**  This is just an opening offer.  I'm prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters.  Depending on how he responds, I can adjust my price accordingly, but I won't go below $150."
