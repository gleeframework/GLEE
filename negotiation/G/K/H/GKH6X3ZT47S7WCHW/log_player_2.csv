"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this excellent product. Given its value, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What do you think?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your constraints, but $1,100,000 is quite a bit below its value.  Could you meet me halfway at $1,250,000?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: You drive a hard bargain, Bob!  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I can't go as low as $1,175,000.  How about $1,210,000? This is my final offer.

This seems like a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $1,210,000, a saving of $290,000 compared to John's offer.
* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated this is her final offer, indicating she's unlikely to move much further. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Continuing to negotiate has diminishing returns. You risk pushing Alice away and might only gain a small amount in further negotiations."
