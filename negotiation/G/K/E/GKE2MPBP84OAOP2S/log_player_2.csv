"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Since your goal is to save as much money as possible and you are willing to pay up to $1,200,000, there is no benefit to negotiating with Alice. John is offering the product at your maximum price point, so it makes sense to buy from him immediately."
