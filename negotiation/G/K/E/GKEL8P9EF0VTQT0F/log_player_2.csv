After careful consideration, we propose a transaction price of $1,350,000 for this exceptional item. This offer reflects the value we place on its quality and the benefits it offers to you. We are confident that this price will provide us with a fair return while still being attractive to you. We look forward to your positive response and the possibility of conducting this business together. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,350,000 is below her product's value to her, it's still more than you're willing to pay. You know you can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. By rejecting Alice's offer, you keep the negotiation open and can potentially get a better price from Alice or proceed with buying from John."
