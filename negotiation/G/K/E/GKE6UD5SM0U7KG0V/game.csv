"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $100 is unfortunately too low for me. How about $110? It's a fair price that gives you a good value and allows me to make a reasonable profit.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I see you're determined to get a good price.  $105 is closer, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you halfway - how about $107.50?  This is a good compromise for both of us.",107.5,Alice,5,
