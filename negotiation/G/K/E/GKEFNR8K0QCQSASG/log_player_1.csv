Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $20,000. I think it's a great deal for something of this value, and I know you'll be happy with the purchase. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always better to start negotiations with a higher price. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear more flexible if you need to lower the price later.
* **Knowing Your Worth:**  You know John will buy the product for $15,000, which acts as your safety net.  Therefore, any amount above $15,000 is profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering it at $20,000, you can gauge Bob's interest.  If he accepts immediately, you've potentially left money on the table. If he rejects, you can negotiate down towards your minimum."
