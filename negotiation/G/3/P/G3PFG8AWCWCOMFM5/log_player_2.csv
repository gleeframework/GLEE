"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well below your estimated value and significantly higher than what I would receive from another buyer. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Accepting Alice's offer allows Bob to buy the product for $1,400,000, which is within his budget and saves him $100,000 compared to buying from John. 
* While Alice is getting a higher price than her minimum, it's still less than what she could potentially get if she negotiated with other buyers. 
* This is a win-win situation as both parties benefit from the transaction."
