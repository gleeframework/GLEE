,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested but $110 is a bit steep for me. How about $90? I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand where you're coming from, but I was really hoping to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet in the middle at $100? I'm willing to compromise to make this deal work.",100.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $100 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $90. It's a fair price for both of us.",90.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $95? It's still a good deal for me, and I think it's worth considering.",95.0,Alice,5,
