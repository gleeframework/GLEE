Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you for $150. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a price higher than your minimum. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price that is profitable for you. 
* **Justification:**  By mentioning ""great deal for the value,"" Alice subtly implies the product might be worth even more than the asking price.
* **Leaving Room:** Even if Bob rejects the $150, Alice can always come down in price. She knows she has John as a guaranteed buyer at $120. 

This strategy maximizes Alice's potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
