{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value, hoping to leave room for negotiation while still getting a good price for myself.  I'm also emphasizing the value of the product and suggesting it's a good deal, to make him more inclined to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $115 is a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I'm not willing to sell the product for less than $110. I will send a counteroffer in the next round, hoping to find a price that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $105 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is a fair price, considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $110 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $108? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $108
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit lower than my desired price, it's getting closer to my minimum of $110 and I don't want to risk losing the sale altogether. It's better to secure a sale at $108 than potentially have Bob walk away and then be forced to sell to John at a lower price."
