"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal.",1225000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price.",1200000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,210,000.
