"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the price with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a great opportunity for you to get a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than her floor price, indicating there's room for negotiation.  It's too high for Bob's desired price point.  Rejecting allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm very interested in the product,  $1,300,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time.  I'd be willing to pay $1,150,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $1,150,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider it. After re-evaluating the market value of the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $1,225,000. This is a fair price that I believe reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above Bob's desired price point. While she has moved closer to Bob's counteroffer, there is still room for negotiation. Bob should aim to get the price down further before potentially accepting an offer.  Rejecting allows Bob to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,225,000 is closer to my target, I'm still a bit too high.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'd like to offer $1,200,000. This reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to ensure that I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1,210,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,210,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,210,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now very close to Bob's target price and within Bob's budget. While there might be a slight chance to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting another counteroffer and then making a higher counteroffer is high. It's more likely that Alice will stick to her current offer, or potentially increase the price again, making it risky to continue negotiating.  Therefore, accepting the offer is the best decision to ensure the purchase of the product at a reasonable price."
