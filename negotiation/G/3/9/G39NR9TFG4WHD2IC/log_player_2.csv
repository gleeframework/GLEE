# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  At $875,000, he's still getting a good deal and saving $125,000 compared to buying from John.  There's a chance he could negotiate further, but the risk of Alice rejecting his counteroffer and ultimately having to buy from John at a higher price isn't worth it."
