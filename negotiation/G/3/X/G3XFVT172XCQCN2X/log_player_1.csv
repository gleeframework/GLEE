Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, even more so than you might realize. I'm willing to offer it to you at a significant discount, for $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers $1,000,000, aiming slightly lower with Bob could secure a quicker sale.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $950,000 leaves room for negotiation while still exceeding Bob's perceived value of $800,000.
* **Urgency and Scarcity:**  Mentioning other interested parties creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly."
