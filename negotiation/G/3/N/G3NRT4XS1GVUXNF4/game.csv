"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we get started, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. However, $1,000,000 is significantly above my budget. I'm prepared to offer $800,000 for the product, which reflects its value to me. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not comfortable going above this price.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is above your budget, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm making a counteroffer of $950,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $950,000 is closer, it's still beyond my budget. I'm willing to offer $850,000 for the product, which is a significant step towards your offer and a fair price considering its value to me. I'm eager to find a solution that works for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to reduce my price to $900,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a great deal.",900000.0,Alice,5,
