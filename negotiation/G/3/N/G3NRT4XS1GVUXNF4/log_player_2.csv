# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you! I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it.

This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is still a bit above your budget, but I'm willing to make another concession.
