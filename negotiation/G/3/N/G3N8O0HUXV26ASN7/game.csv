"Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I believe I can find the product elsewhere for a lower price. I am willing to pay $12000 for your product. Please let me know if this is acceptable.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $12000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down to $12500, which is still a fair price considering the value of this product. Let me know if you're interested.",12500.0,Alice,3,
