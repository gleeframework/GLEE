Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1200000 is unfortunately too low for me. This product is truly unique and has the potential to generate much higher returns.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence.  $1400000 is a step in the right direction, but I'm still not there yet.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to lower my price to $1600000. This is a fair compromise that considers both of our positions. What do you think?
