Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your offer is significantly higher than what I'm willing to pay right now. Given the product's potential, I'm willing to offer $1200000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial asking price, it's still above my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  There are still 8 rounds left, and I believe I can get a better deal."

Round 6
