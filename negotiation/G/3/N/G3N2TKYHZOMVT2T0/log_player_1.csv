"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it's worth $175.  Are you interested?"", ""product_price"": 175}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum value ($150) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $175 is a good starting point as it gives Bob some room to counteroffer while still leaving me some profit. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly tone to encourage a positive negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's worth less than $175. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly below my minimum value of $150 and also below what the product is worth to Bob ($100). 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:** I can still potentially get a better price from Bob by making a counteroffer.
* **Selling to John is a safety net:**  While selling to John for $150 is a guaranteed deal, I still have rounds left to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? That's a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering $140, which is closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. This shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:** I'm framing the counteroffer as a ""good price for both of us,"" highlighting the potential for a win-win situation.
* **Positive and Open Tone:** I'm maintaining a friendly tone, emphasizing my openness to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $140 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $130 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:** $130 is still below my minimum value of $150. 
* **Potential for higher price:** While Bob has moved closer to my price, there is still potential to get closer to my ideal value.
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  While I could sell to John for $150, I still have rounds left and could potentially get closer to $150 or even higher with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  $130 is closer, but I'm still a bit off. Would you consider $135? It's a fair price, and I'm sure we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Increment:** I'm only increasing the price by $5, showing a willingness to compromise. 
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm framing this as a ""fair price"" to appeal to Bob's sense of reason. 
* **Emphasize Closing:** I'm mentioning ""closing this deal"" to nudge Bob towards accepting."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I still think $135 is a bit high. I'm willing to pay $132 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $132. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $132
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** While $132 is only slightly below my minimum value of $150, I'm running out of rounds and there's no guarantee Bob will budge further.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** There's a chance Bob might reject my next counteroffer, leading to further back-and-forth that might not result in a better price.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $150 guarantees me a profit and minimizes risk. It's the most sensible option at this point in the negotiation."
