"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $1,000,000. I'm confident you'll agree that this is a fair and reasonable price. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than buying from John.**  Even though Alice's offer is $900,000, it's still $100,000 less than buying from John.
* **You still get a good deal.**  You value the product at $1,000,000, and you're getting it for $900,000, which is a significant saving."
