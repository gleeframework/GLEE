"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product has value, I'm hoping we can settle on a price that's a bit more advantageous for both of us. Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to negotiate, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a little closer.  To be frank, I'm working with a tight budget on this acquisition. I could meet you at $825,000, which I feel is a fair compromise. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",825000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $825,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $875,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",875000.0,Alice,5,
