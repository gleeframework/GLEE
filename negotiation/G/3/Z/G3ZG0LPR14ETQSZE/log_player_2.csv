Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting close to your desired price point.  It's unlikely you'll get a lower price, and continuing to negotiate risks the deal falling apart.  Accepting the offer secures the product at a price well below your maximum budget and avoids the risk of having to buy from John at a significantly higher price."
