"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1800000} 
```

I'm starting high, knowing Bob values the product at $800,000. This sets the stage for negotiation and gives me room to maneuver in subsequent rounds.  I believe this offer will be rejected, but it sets the benchmark for our negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,200,000 is a significant amount, it's still below my minimum threshold of $1,500,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and continue negotiating to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $1,600,000. This is still a significant discount from my initial offer but keeps the negotiation moving forward.  It also positions me closer to my minimum goal while leaving room for further compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, and I'm worried we're not going to reach my minimum goal.  I'm going to take the guaranteed $1,500,000 from John rather than risk getting a lower offer from Bob."
