"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm aiming to sell it for $18,000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer Alice, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $12,000 for it.  That's my absolute maximum.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob.  However, I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  How about we meet in the middle at $15,000?",15000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $15,000 is still too high for me.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  That's the most I can afford.",12000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm seeing that we both value this product.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to get at least $13,500 for it. This is my final offer.",13500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $13,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and do $12,750.  This is my final offer, I'm not going to go any higher.",12750.0,Bob,6,
