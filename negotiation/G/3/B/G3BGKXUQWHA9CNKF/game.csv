"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I've done some research and believe it's worth a significant amount to you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, and I think you'll be hard-pressed to find a better offer elsewhere.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product, reflecting its value to me and leaving room for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's see if we can reach a compromise.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering its value to both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $850000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  However, I'm willing to meet you halfway again.  How about $800000? This price reflects the value of the product to both of us, and I believe it's a fair compromise. ",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not willing to sell the product at $800000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $825000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to consider, and I believe it's still a fair deal considering the product's value to both of us.",825000.0,Alice,5,
