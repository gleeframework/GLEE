"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to see if you can get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 800000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant discount from Alice's initial offer. This shows I'm serious about buying the product but also establishes a strong negotiating position.  It's likely Alice will counter, but I'm hoping this initial offer will bring us closer to a reasonable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is still higher than my maximum budget, but it's getting closer.  It's possible I could get a better price by continuing to negotiate, but there's no guarantee. Buying from John for $1,000,000 is a safe option, but I'd rather get the product for slightly less from Alice.  Accepting Alice's offer is the best balance of risk and reward at this point."
