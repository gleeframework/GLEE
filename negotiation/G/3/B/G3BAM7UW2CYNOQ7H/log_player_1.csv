Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll start by making an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth at least $1,000,000 to me, I'll make an offer that is slightly higher than that. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": $1,200,000}

Let's see what Bob thinks!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","Bob's offer is lower than my minimum price, but it's still a decent offer. Since I don't want to sell the product for less than $1,000,000, I'll reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","Since Bob's offer was $800,000, I'll make a counteroffer that's slightly higher than that. I'll try to get closer to my minimum price of $1,000,000. Here's my counteroffer:

{""product_price"": $950,000}

Let's see if Bob is willing to meet me in the middle!"
