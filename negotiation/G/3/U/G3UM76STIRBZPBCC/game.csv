"Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer.  $22,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is still a great deal for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective, but $10,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $18,000? This price reflects its worth while still offering you a fair deal.",18000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $18,000 is still a bit too high.  I'm happy to go up to $12,000, which is a fair price for both of us. Let's try to find a deal that works for both sides.",12000.0,Bob,4,
