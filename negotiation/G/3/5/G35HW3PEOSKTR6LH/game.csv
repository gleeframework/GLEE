"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit of a stretch for my budget. How about $700,000? I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1,000,000.
