Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000, which is still a significant investment and reflects the product's worth. Let's see if we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000

Round 4
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer and a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is unlikely to drastically increase his offer.  While $900,000 is a good offer, accepting John's standing offer of $1,000,000 is the best way to maximize profit and minimize risk."
