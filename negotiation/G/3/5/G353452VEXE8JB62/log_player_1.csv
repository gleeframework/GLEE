Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $150. It's a great deal for something of this quality."", 
""product_price"": 150
}
``` 
 
I'm starting high to see if Bob is willing to pay above market value.  This leaves room for negotiation if he counters, but still ensures I get more than my minimum if he accepts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $120 is a reasonable profit, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob seems interested, so I'll try to meet him halfway."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate your interest, Bob.  $150 might have been a tad high, so how about we meet in the middle at $135?  It's a fair price for both of us."",
""product_price"": 135
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $135 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $125 for the product. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is clearly anchored at $125 and unlikely to go much higher. Accepting $125 ensures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away. It's a good deal!"
