Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob rejects.  It's important to start high, as I can always lower the price if necessary, but I can't raise it once I've offered a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $125? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than what the product is worth to me ($125 vs $150 minimum).  It's worth pushing for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $125 is a little low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $140?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll love the product."", ""product_price"": 140} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're looking to make a profit, but $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. Would you be willing to consider a price of $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $130 is still below my ideal price, it's getting closer to my minimum acceptable offer of $150.  Bob seems to be sticking to his price point, and it's unlikely we'll get much higher.  I'll take the $130 and move on."
