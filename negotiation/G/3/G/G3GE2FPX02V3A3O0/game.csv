"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's something that I'm confident could significantly benefit your business. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This price is a reflection of the product's true potential, but also allows for a fair margin for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss it further.",900000.0,Alice,1,
