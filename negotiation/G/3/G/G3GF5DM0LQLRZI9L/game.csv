"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is way above my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only offer $10,000 at this time.  Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $14,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $14,000 is still a bit above what I can afford.  Would you be willing to accept $12,000?  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to go down to $12,500, but I don't think I can go any lower than that. This is my final offer, so let's see if we can make a deal.",12500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're close to your minimum.  Would you consider $12,000?  It's a fair compromise between our last offers.  If we can agree on this price, I'm ready to purchase right away.",12000.0,Bob,8,
