"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us.",145.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my absolute bottom line. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with another buyer. What do you think?",140.0,Alice,5,
