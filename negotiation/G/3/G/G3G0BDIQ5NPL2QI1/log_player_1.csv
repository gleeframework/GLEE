{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it.  I'm asking $175 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $175, which is a little higher than my minimum acceptable price of $150. This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.
* **Friendly Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the product's value, making Bob more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message also implies a willingness to negotiate, making Bob feel like he has some power in the conversation. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I really like the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $120? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $120 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  I believe I can get a better price from Bob, or at least closer to my minimum, with a counteroffer.
* **John is a backup:**  I'm not desperate for a sale, and I have John as a guaranteed buyer at $150, giving me leverage in the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product!  While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about we split the difference and settle on $145?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 145}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a compromise:** Instead of completely rejecting Bob's offer, I'm suggesting a middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate but also maintains my starting point.
* **Fairness and mutual benefit:**  My counteroffer emphasizes finding a price that's good for both of us. 
* **Positive tone:** I continue to use a friendly and encouraging tone, hoping to keep the negotiation amicable. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $130? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob has moved closer to my desired price, $130 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **John is a safe bet:**  I'm confident that I can get at least my minimum from John, so there's no urgency to settle for a lower price.
* **Potential for higher offer:**  I believe I can still push for a better price from Bob with a final counteroffer. 

I'm going to try one more time to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to come down to $140, but that's my absolute bottom line. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to go with another buyer. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This is my last counteroffer, signaling that I'm serious about this price.
* **Firm but Fair:** $140 is still above my minimum acceptable price of $150, but I'm trying to meet Bob halfway.
* **Slight Pressure:** The message subtly suggests I'm ready to walk away if he doesn't accept, adding a touch of pressure.
* **Clarity:** I clearly state that this is my final offer to avoid further negotiation.

I'm hoping Bob will realize that $140 is a good deal for him, and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $140, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $135? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **No room for compromise:** Bob's offer of $135 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. There's no point in continuing the negotiation as I'm not willing to go lower.
* **John's offer is guaranteed:**  Selling to John at $150 is the safest and most profitable option.  I've already established a firm minimum, and further negotiation with Bob is unlikely to yield a better result.
* **Avoiding further delays:**  By selling to John, I avoid the risk of further negotiation rounds that might ultimately lead to a lower price or a stalemate. 

It's time to move on and secure a sale with John!"
