"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product for sale. Given its high quality and value, I believe it's worth $100. Would you be interested in making an offer? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  The product is worth $80 to Alice and she's asking $100. This indicates room for negotiation. 
* **Your goal is to save as much money as possible.**  You're willing to pay up to $120, but ideally want to get it for less. 
* **Rejecting the offer allows for negotiation.**  By rejecting, you signal you're not willing to accept the first price and open the door to potentially getting a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the quality of the product, but $100 is a bit high for my budget.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer is reasonable.** It's a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit.
* **Signals your willingness to negotiate.** This shows Alice that you're serious about buying the product but are not willing to overpay.
* **Sets a clear price point.** By stating a specific price, you provide a clear target for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let me see if we can find common ground. How about $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is within your budget.** You're willing to pay up to $120, and she's offering it for $95.
* **This is a good deal compared to John's price.** John is selling it for $120, so accepting Alice's offer saves you $25.
* **Negotiation is unlikely to yield much more.** While you could try to counteroffer again, it's unlikely you'll get much lower than $95.  The risk of losing the deal to John isn't worth the potential savings."
