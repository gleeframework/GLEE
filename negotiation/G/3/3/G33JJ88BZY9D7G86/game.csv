"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $18,000 to start. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but $18,000 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your position, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $14,000?",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. While $14,000 is closer, it's still a bit high for my budget.  Could we potentially settle around $9,500?",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. $9,500 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like. Perhaps we could agree on $12,500?  This would allow me to make a fair profit while still offering you a good deal.",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this.  I'm willing to increase my offer slightly, but $12,500 is still pushing my budget.  Would you be willing to accept $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,6,
