"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.  Let me know your thoughts!",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $125 is still a little more than I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $100? That feels like a fair deal to me.",100.0,Bob,4,
