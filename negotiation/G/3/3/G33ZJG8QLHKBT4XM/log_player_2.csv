"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1000000.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, and I'm confident it will be incredibly valuable to you. Let's discuss! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum budget, it's always worth trying to negotiate. There's no guarantee that you'll get a better price from Alice, but there's also no downside to trying. If she rejects your counteroffer, you can always buy from John."

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is a bit steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  It's a fair price, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, demonstrating a willingness to negotiate. The amount is still substantial, showing that you're serious about buying the product, but it leaves room for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. I'm willing to come down to $900000 for the product. It's a fair price considering the value it holds, and I'm confident it will be worth much more to you in the long run. Let's make this deal work! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down in price, but it's still higher than my counteroffer. I'm willing to continue negotiating. There's a chance I can get a better price from Alice or, at the very least, get closer to my target price before having to buy from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer, I'm still hoping for a price closer to my initial offer of $750,000. Let's split the difference and aim for $825,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and allows us to come to an agreement.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm taking a more moderate approach to my counteroffer, demonstrating that I'm willing to compromise.  Splitting the difference between our previous offers keeps negotiations moving forward while giving Alice a clear path to a deal that's still above my initial counteroffer."
