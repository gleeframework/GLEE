"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $1,450,000 is less than John's price, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1350000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves room for some profit for Alice, since her floor price is $1,200,000. It's also significantly lower than the $1,500,000 that Bob could pay John for the product. This counteroffer is a good starting point for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it is still above Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There's still room for Alice to lower her price while still profiting, and Bob can continue to push for a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1375000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to get the best price possible, and he's showing Alice that he's serious about negotiating. This counteroffer is a slight increase from the previous offer, but it still falls within a reasonable range.  It signals that Bob is willing to compromise, but he also wants to make sure he's getting a good deal."
