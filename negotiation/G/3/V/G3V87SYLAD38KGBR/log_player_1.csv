I'm offering the product to Bob for $1,450,000. This leaves room for negotiation, as it's less than his estimated value, but still significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially secure a price closer to his perceived value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is above my minimum, it's still significantly lower than my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
```

I'm counteroffering at $1,400,000. This is a compromise, coming down from my initial offer but still leaving some room for potential negotiation. I believe this price is fair, considering Bob's value and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,375,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,375,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, and I'm willing to accept it at this point. Continuing to negotiate risks delaying the sale and potentially leading to a lower price if Bob ultimately decides to back out. Accepting his offer secures a good deal with a relatively quick outcome."
