Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe it's a fair price considering what you could gain from it."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** While John offers a safe $15,000, aiming higher with Bob could yield a greater profit. 
* **Starting High:** This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the product's ""value and potential"" attempts to justify the high price, even though Bob values it lower. 

**Important Note:**  There's a risk Bob might reject the offer outright. However, since we know his maximum valuation ($12,000),  starting negotiations significantly above that gives us leverage to potentially settle closer to his limit while still exceeding John's offer."
