"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $12,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering my budget constraints. Please let me know if this is something we can agree upon.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm unable to go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I am still not able to meet you at $13,000. I would like to propose $12,500 as my maximum offer. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your continued interest in the product. While I'm willing to negotiate, $12,500 is still quite a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile. Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to accept $12,750 for the product.  This is a fair compromise that would allow us both to walk away happy.",12750.0,Alice,5,
