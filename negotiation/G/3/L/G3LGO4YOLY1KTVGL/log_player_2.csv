{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

You should buy the product from John.  Alice is getting closer to your maximum price of $120, and it is likely that you will not be able to negotiate a price lower than $120 with Alice.  At this point, it is better to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
