"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
```

I'm going to start with a price slightly higher than my minimum value. This will allow me some room for negotiation, while still ensuring I get a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay a little extra to get it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum value. I want to try and push for a higher price. I have a backup option with John, so I'm not under pressure to accept a lower price. I'll counter Bob's offer and see if we can find a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with my minimum value. It's a fair price, considering the product is worth $10,000 to Bob.  I'm hopeful he'll see the value in the product and agree to this price. If he doesn't, I can always sell to John for $12,000."
