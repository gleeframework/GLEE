Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's close to Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Room for Compromise:**  $1,400,000 is a significant amount for Bob, but it also gives him room to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.
* **Opportunity to Gain:** If Bob accepts, I've secured a good profit. If he counters, I have room to negotiate downwards while still exceeding my minimum requirement.
* **Safeguard:** Having John as a backup option provides security. If negotiations with Bob fall through, I can still secure a sale at my minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While it's a significant amount, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I believe there's still room to negotiate a better price. 
* **John is a backup:** I can still sell to John for $1,000,000 if negotiations with Bob fail.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still allows me to make a reasonable profit, while offering you a good value. I'm hoping we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I've moved closer to Bob's offer, demonstrating flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintain Profit:** The new offer is still above my minimum requirement and provides me with a decent profit margin.
* **Focus on Value:** I'm emphasizing the value of the product to Bob, reminding him that $1,300,000 is still a good deal.
* **Positive Tone:** My message is positive and encouraging, fostering a collaborative negotiation process. 

I believe this counteroffer increases the chances of a successful deal while still protecting my interests."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** Bob has essentially met me halfway with his offer, and it's very close to my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Final Offer:** Bob's statement that this is his final offer implies that further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **Secure Profit:**  While it's not my ideal price, $1,250,000 still represents a substantial profit and exceeds my minimum requirement.
* **Risk of Losing the Deal:**  Rejecting his offer might lead to a stalemate or a complete breakdown in negotiations. Selling to John would secure a sale, but at a lower price.

Therefore, accepting Bob's offer is the most pragmatic decision, as it secures a good deal while minimizing the risk of losing the sale altogether."
