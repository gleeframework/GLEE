"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I'm open to discussing this further and finding a solution that benefits both of us.",2300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, $2,300,000 is significantly above my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $850,000 for it.  I believe this is a fair price that allows for both of us to benefit from this transaction.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is considerably below its true value.  I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $1,900,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your interest.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,900,000 is still out of my price range.  I'm happy to go up to $1,000,000.  This is a significant increase from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value of the product.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
