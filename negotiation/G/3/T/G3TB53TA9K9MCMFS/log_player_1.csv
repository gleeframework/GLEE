Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $175. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 175
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always good to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to counter-offer.
* **Not Too High:** While we want to maximize profit, setting the price too high (like $250) might scare Bob away instantly.  A price of $175 leaves a reasonable chance he'll consider it.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""limited time"" and ""great deal for the value,""  we create a sense of urgency and subtly imply the product might be worth even more. 

**Important Note:** If Bob rejects this initial offer, Alice can always propose a lower price, eventually going down to $150 if needed."
