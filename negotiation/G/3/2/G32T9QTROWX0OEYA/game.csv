"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, I am looking to keep my investment within a specific budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations and our mutual interests.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget constraints. However, $950,000 is significantly below the value I believe this product holds.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  This reflects a considerable compromise on my end, and I truly believe this product will be a valuable asset for you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
