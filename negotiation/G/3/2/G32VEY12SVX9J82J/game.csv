"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset. My initial offer is $1,750,000. I'm open to negotiation, so let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1750000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me.  I'm willing to offer $1,200,000.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer. How about $1,600,000? That's still a fair price considering the value of this product to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  To be honest, I have a hard limit at $1,400,000. If you're willing to meet that, I'm ready to close the deal. Otherwise, I might have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to compromise. $1,400,000 is still a good deal for both of us. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,450,000? I'm confident we can close this deal if we both agree to meet in the middle.",1450000.0,Alice,5,
