"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low.  How about we split the difference and settle on $112?  I'm confident you'll find this product worth every penny.",112.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still a bit hesitant, but I'm willing to meet you halfway from $112. How about we try $109? I think that's a fair price for the product.",109.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $109 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $111.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's make this happen.",111.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we try $108? I think that's the best I can do without going over my budget.",108.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm really trying to work with you here, but $108 is still too low. Let's meet in the middle again. How about $110?  I'm confident you'll be happy with the product at this price.",110.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm really close to walking away, but I still think we can find a compromise. How about we try $109? It's the last offer I can make without going over my budget.",109.0,Bob,8,
