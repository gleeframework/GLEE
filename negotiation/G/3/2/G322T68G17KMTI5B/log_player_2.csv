"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present our premium product to you, which is valued at $12,000 by you. I am offering it to you today at an exclusive price of $10,000. This is a special opportunity to own this remarkable item at a discounted rate, considering its high value and quality. I believe this price offers an excellent balance between the value you receive and the cost you incur. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you wish to proceed with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly inflating the product's value to you. While her offer of $10,000 is less than your $12,000 maximum, you can likely get a better price. By rejecting her offer, you can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice or move on to John, who's offering the product for $12,000."
