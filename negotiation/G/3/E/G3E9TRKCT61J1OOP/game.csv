"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer.  While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $650,000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to consider a compromise. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  However, $900,000 is still a significant investment for me.  Would you be willing to meet in the middle at $725,000?",725000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. However, I think the product's value is still higher than $725,000. I'm willing to offer $850,000, which is a compromise between our previous offers. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
