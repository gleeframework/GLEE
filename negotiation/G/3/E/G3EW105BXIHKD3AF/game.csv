"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. Can you meet me at that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $8,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we meet at $9,500? I'm willing to pay that much for it.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting closer.  $9,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $11,000 for a quick sale. This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still not there. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,500. That's the best I can do.",10500.0,Bob,6,
