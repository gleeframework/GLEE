{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,100,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price before going to John."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my price point, but $1,050,000 is still higher than I'd like to pay. I'll counter again and see if we can meet somewhere in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1025000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,037,500. This is my final offer for this round. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,037,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,037,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd like to get a lower price, Alice is clearly firm on her position.  $1,037,500 is a good compromise, significantly lower than John's price, and it gets me the product without risking further negotiation."
