"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're looking to pay a lower price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,000,000. I can offer you a discount, but I need to make a profit. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product and our shared desire to reach an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $1,025,000 is the right price for this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $1,050,000 and $1,025,000, which would be $1,037,500. This is my final offer for this round.",1037500.0,Alice,5,
