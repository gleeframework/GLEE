Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in. I'm asking for $120 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 
 
This offer is a starting point. It's above your minimum of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation. It also allows for a potential counter-offer from Bob.  By being upfront about your pricing, you establish a baseline for further discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. Would you be willing to sell it to me for that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While $100 is less than my initial ask, it's still a profitable sale and above my minimum threshold. It's better to close the deal now and avoid further negotiations, which could potentially lead to a lower price or a failed sale."
