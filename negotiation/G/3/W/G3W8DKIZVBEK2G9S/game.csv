"I'm very interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $9000?",9000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $9000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we compromise at $9500?",9500.0,Alice,3,
