Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, you have significant leverage. Starting with a price of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while aiming for a 50% profit margin.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency and scarcity, potentially motivating Bob to act quickly.
* **Value Emphasis:** Highlighting your confidence in the product's value reinforces its worth in Bob's mind. 

**Important Note:**  This is just one possible strategy. Depending on your risk tolerance and Bob's perceived negotiating style, you might adjust the offer price."
