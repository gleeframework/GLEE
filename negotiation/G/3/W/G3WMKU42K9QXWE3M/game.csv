,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While the product looks great, $130 is a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $60?",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",95.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand, Alice. $95 is closer, but still a bit high for my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $75? ",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product.",85.0,Alice,5,
