"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $130 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest but $60 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $75 is still below my minimum.  Let's try $85. It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85.

While Alice is getting closer to your price range, it's unlikely she'll go much lower than $85. You have the option to buy from John for $80, meeting your goal of spending no more than that."
