"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value of $8,000 but lower than my minimum of $15,000. This gives me room to negotiate while still securing a good profit.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm being friendly and encouraging, emphasizing the value Bob will get from the product.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffer:** I'm anticipating a counteroffer and giving Bob space to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more mutually beneficial agreement. I am willing to pay $9,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's closer to my minimum, it's still below the $12,000 mark I'd be willing to accept.
* **Negotiation is still possible:** I have 8 rounds left, and I believe I can still get a better price.
* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the power of the negotiation and can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Maintaining a High Starting Point:**  I'm moving closer to Bob's offer but still staying above my minimum. This ensures I'm not giving away too much too early. 
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** I'm emphasizing that I've lowered my price, making it clear I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Positive and Encouraging:** I'm staying friendly and hopeful, keeping the conversation open."

```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While it's getting closer to my minimum, it's still below the $11,000 mark I'd be willing to accept.

* **Maintaining control:** By rejecting his offer, I maintain the power of the negotiation and can make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm offering a price halfway between my previous offer ($11,000) and Bob's offer ($10,500). This shows I'm willing to compromise and makes it more likely Bob will accept.
* **Highlighting the Compromise:** I'm explicitly stating that this is a ""fair compromise,"" emphasizing that I'm giving up some ground.
* **Positive and Persuasive:** I'm using language like ""good deal"" and ""what do you say"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your effort to find a compromise. I would like to counter with an offer of $10,250 for the product. I believe this price reflects the value I place on it while remaining within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is Running Out:** We're nearing the end of the negotiation, and Bob's offers are getting closer to my minimum, but not quite there.
* **Risk of a Lower Price:** There's a risk that Bob will keep lowering his offer, potentially getting even closer to my minimum or even lower. 
* **John's Guaranteed Offer:**  John is offering a guaranteed $15,000, which is significantly higher than anything Bob is offering. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Selling to John eliminates the risk of further negotiation with Bob, who may not be willing to meet my minimum. 

While I would prefer to get closer to my ideal price, selling to John now ensures I receive the best possible outcome considering the time constraints and Bob's offers."
