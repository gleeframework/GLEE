"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your perspective, $9,500 is still too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $10,500 is still a little too low for me. Let's split the difference - I'm willing to accept $10,750. This is a fair compromise, and it allows both of us to get a good deal. What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,5,
