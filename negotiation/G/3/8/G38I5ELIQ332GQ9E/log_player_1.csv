# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer! I really appreciate it. While I'm interested,  $120 is a bit higher than my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $105?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
