"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $700000. I believe it's a great opportunity, but I have to be mindful of my budget.",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $700000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $775000. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the product. What do you think?",775000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that $725000 is still a bit lower than my target, but I'm willing to make another concession. I can do $750000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great price for the product. What do you think?",750000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but $750000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $725000, just like I offered before. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I don't think I can go any higher than that. I'd like to reiterate that I'm very interested in the product, but I need to be mindful of my budget.",725000.0,Bob,6,
