"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $1200000, which is a significant discount from its true value. Let me know if this is something you'd like to move forward with.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the discount, but I think we can work towards a price closer to my valuation of the product. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $950000. I'm willing to come down to $1100000, which is still a significant discount from the market value. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $1050000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal here.",1050000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to meet you at $1050000 was my last offer, but now I'm willing to compromise and go to $1075000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finalize the deal here.",1075000.0,Alice,7,

"I'm getting close to my minimum, Bob. I'm willing to make one final offer. I'll meet you at $1075000, but I need to be honest with you, I'm starting to get a little anxious to finalize this deal. If we can't meet at this price, I may need to consider other options.",1075000.0,Alice,9,
