"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price that reflects the benefits I'll get from it, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, while I appreciate your efforts to reach a middle ground, $9,500 is still a little too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,750, which is a fair price considering the benefits I'll get from the product.  Let's find a way to make this work.",8750.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I'm glad we're finding common ground. To further facilitate a successful transaction, I propose we settle on $9,000 for the product. This price not only respects the value you see in the product but also allows for a more equitable exchange. I believe this could be a satisfactory compromise for both of us.",9000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm happy to see we're getting closer, but $9,000 is still a bit outside of my budget. I'm ready to commit to $8,800 for the product. This represents a significant investment on my end, and I'm confident that it's a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this transaction. Let's finalize this deal, I think we're very close.",8800.0,Bob,6,
