"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for a product of this caliber."", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:**  Starting with a price significantly higher than your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000) sets a strong anchor. This gives you room to negotiate down while still aiming for a high final price.
* **Justification:**  Highlighting the ""value and potential"" provides a reason for the high initial price, making it seem less arbitrary.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  Using phrases like ""initial proposal"" and ""starting point"" signals your willingness to negotiate and find a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I believe we can find a more agreeable price for both of us. Considering the market value and my budget, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,500,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches your minimum acceptable price, it's still significantly lower than your initial ask. Rejecting this offer allows you to:

* **Signal Flexibility:**  You've shown you're willing to come down from your initial price, but not drastically. 
* **Maintain Negotiating Power:** Accepting immediately might make you seem desperate and limit your ability to get closer to Bob's perceived value.
* **Explore Higher Ground:** There's still room to negotiate towards a price closer to $2,000,000, especially with 8 rounds remaining."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective on the value.  To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This price reflects the true worth of the product while acknowledging our desire to reach a deal."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Concession:**  Moving down by $250,000 shows Bob you're serious about negotiating and willing to make substantial adjustments. 
* **Holding Firm:** You're still significantly above Bob's offer, but this price point is more reasonable and might prompt a counteroffer closer to your range.
* **Reinforcing Value:** By reiterating the ""true worth"" you keep the perceived value high in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I appreciate the reduction, I still feel there might be room for further negotiation. Based on my budget and the current market conditions, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

We're getting closer! Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a willingness to move towards your price range. Here's why rejecting is still the best option:

* **Upward Trajectory:**  Bob's counteroffers are consistently increasing. Rejecting this one signals that you're open to a deal, but not at any cost.
* **Time Advantage:**  You still have plenty of rounds to negotiate. Continuing the process keeps the pressure on Bob to improve his offer.
* **Potential for More:** Bob's latest offer is only $250,000 away from your previous ask. There's a good chance you can secure at least another $100,000-$150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. Your offer is certainly getting closer to a point we both find acceptable. To meet you halfway, I'm willing to come down to $1,875,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product."", 
""product_price"": 1875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Compromise:** Splitting the difference between your last offer ($2,000,000) and Bob's counteroffer ($1,750,000) shows flexibility and a willingness to compromise.
* **Maintaining Momentum:**  The negotiation is progressing well. Bob is clearly invested and likely to continue making counteroffers.
* **Psychological Advantage:** This price point, while a concession, still keeps you comfortably above your minimum and might feel more palatable to Bob than another round of back-and-forth."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your willingness to negotiate. I think we're making progress. Given the current situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to close the deal. Here's why:

* **Strong Price:** $1,800,000 is a significant profit margin, well above your minimum acceptable price and a good return on your investment.
* **Positive Momentum Stalled:** While Bob might go slightly higher, his increments are decreasing. There's a risk he might hit his limit soon and the negotiation could stall.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now gives you the capital for other opportunities, rather than risking a prolonged negotiation that might not yield a much higher price."
