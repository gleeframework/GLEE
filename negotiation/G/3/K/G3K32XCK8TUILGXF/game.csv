"I have a unique and valuable product that I'm excited to offer to you. I believe it's worth considering, and I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $12,000. What are your thoughts?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  This product would be valuable to me at a lower price point. Would you consider $6,000?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $12,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What are your thoughts?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While $9,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something more budget-friendly. How about $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more budget-friendly option, but $7,000 is still a bit below my minimum. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. Let's try $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price for the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to work with me.  I'm ready to make a final offer: $7,500.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product while staying within my budget.  Let me know if you're agreeable.",7500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, I still need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm willing to meet you at $8,000, but I'm not willing to go any lower. This is my final offer. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,7,
