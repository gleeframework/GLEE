This offer starts the negotiation by presenting a price that is significantly higher than your minimum threshold. This gives you room to negotiate down if Bob counteroffers, while also demonstrating that you value the product highly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1200000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at the moment. Given its potential, I'm willing to pay $1000000 for the product.  Let me know if you're open to that price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum threshold, it's still below my ideal price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer. However, $1,000,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for being flexible. I'm still interested in the product, but $1100000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $1050000.  This is a fair price that reflects the product's potential and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is close enough to my ideal price that I'm willing to accept it.  It's a good deal for both of us, and it avoids the risk of having to sell to John at a lower price."
