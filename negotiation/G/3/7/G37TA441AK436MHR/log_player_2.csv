"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's the reasoning:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Buying from Alice at $9,500 saves you $500 compared to buying from John at $10,000.
* **The price is still within your budget:** You're willing to pay up to $10,000, so $9,500 is still a good deal for you."
