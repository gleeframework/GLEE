At this point, Bob is offering $990,000, which is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but I'm still losing money. I've had 7 rounds of negotiations, and I only have 3 left.  It's unlikely Bob will increase his offer significantly enough in the remaining rounds for me to reach my desired profit margin.  Therefore, it's more profitable to sell to John for $1,200,000."
