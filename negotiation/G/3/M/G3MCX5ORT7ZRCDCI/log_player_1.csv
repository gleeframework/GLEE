Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price point."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to consider $7,800? I'm really interested in the product and think it's worth it, but I need to make sure it fits within my means.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum price, it's still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'm also not afraid to walk away and sell to John if I don't get a satisfactory price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're really determined to get this product.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,200? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the value you get.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 8200}

Round 6
Bob's offer:

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is tempting and getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I've had several rounds of negotiation, and it seems like we're not going to reach a price that satisfies both of us.  To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get at least my minimum, I'll sell to John for $8,000."
