"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the product, $11,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. I'm willing to pay $10,500,  which is still a good deal for you considering your value.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $10,500 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800. This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",10800.0,Alice,3,
