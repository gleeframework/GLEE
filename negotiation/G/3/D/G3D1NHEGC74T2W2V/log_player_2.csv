{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $1,100,000 is within Bob's budget, there's room for negotiation.  By rejecting, Bob can attempt to get a lower price and save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is starting with a bold counteroffer, aiming to get a significantly lower price than Alice's initial offer. This is a risky move but could pay off if Alice is willing to negotiate.  If Alice rejects this, Bob can then adjust his counteroffer in subsequent rounds."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's closer to his budget, it's still higher than what he could get from John.  By rejecting, Bob can keep trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice. He still has time to get a better deal or go to John as a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is now offering John's price. This is a smart move. It shows Alice that Bob is serious about getting a deal, and that he has a viable alternative. This might push Alice to consider accepting the offer, as she might lose the deal entirely if she rejects it."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While John's price is lower, the deal with Alice is now within Bob's budget and only $30,000 more than John's price.  Considering the limited rounds remaining, it's not worth risking the deal to continue negotiating.  It's a good outcome for Bob, and secures him the product."
