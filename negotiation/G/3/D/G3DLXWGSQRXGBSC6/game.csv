"I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it, considering its value to me. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. While $1,200,000 represents its true value, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000.  I believe this price point recognizes the value it brings while still being fair for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
