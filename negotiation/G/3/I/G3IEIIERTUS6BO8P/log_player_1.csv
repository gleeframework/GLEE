Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product which I know you're interested in.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $13,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 13000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $15,000, so starting near that figure is ideal.
* **Leave Negotiation Room:** While starting high, the offer shouldn't be so high (e.g., $14,500) that it immediately discourages Bob from countering.  
* **Alternative Option:** Knowing John provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, you're still guaranteed a decent amount ($8,000).
* **Clear and Direct Communication:** The message is concise and emphasizes the product's value to Bob."
