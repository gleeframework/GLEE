"Alice, while I appreciate the offer, $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant gain for you, and a price I can comfortably afford.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $950,000, which is a fair compromise considering the value of the product.  This gives you a good deal, and leaves me with a reasonable profit. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground. Let's meet in the middle at $900,000. This is a fair price for both of us, allowing me to acquire the product and you to secure a profitable sale.",900000.0,Bob,4,
