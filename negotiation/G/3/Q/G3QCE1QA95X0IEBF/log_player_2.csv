# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us - you get a fantastic product at a competitive price, and I can move it quickly. Let me know what you think!

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000, and I can get the product for $1,200,000 from John. It's not worth risking further negotiation for a relatively small potential saving."
