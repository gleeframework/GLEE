"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $1,050,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further,  but I need to be closer to my asking price to make this work. How about $1,250,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be well worth the investment.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
