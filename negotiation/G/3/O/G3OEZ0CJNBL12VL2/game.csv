"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but the price is a little high for me.  Would you consider a lower price of $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for you, and I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving towards my price range.  How about we settle at $750,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're close to a deal, Bob. However, $750,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirement. I can offer the product to you for $1,000,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
