"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm interested in the product, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now. Would you be open to $110? ",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer! I understand that $130 might be a bit steep, but I'm still interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. What do you think?",125.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115? That's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to close the deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $115 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer. I'll sell the product to you for $122. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the product's value.",122.0,Alice,5,
