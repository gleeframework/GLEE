"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $1,250,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you is also $1,200,000.  This price allows me to maximize my earnings while still ensuring a fair deal for you.  Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer is $1,250,000, which is more than the maximum you're willing to pay ($1,200,000).  While it's a ""fair deal"" in terms of your perceived value, it doesn't meet your goal of saving money.  You're better off rejecting her offer and buying from John."
