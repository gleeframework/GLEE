"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1400000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you, and still allows me to get a good return on my investment. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits us both. Let me know what you think.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  I'm willing to pay $1300000 for the product.  This is still a good profit for you, and it gets me closer to my target price.  Let's see if we can make this work.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  I'm willing to come down to $1350000. This is still a fair price for both of us, and I'm sure we can find common ground.  Let me know what you think.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
