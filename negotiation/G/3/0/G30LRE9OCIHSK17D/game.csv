"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a fair deal. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $9,500. What do you think?",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  How about $8,500? That's a fair price for both of us, and it gives us room to close the deal.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. How about we settle on $9,000? It's a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value to me.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,000 is still a little high for me. Let's split the difference and go with $8,750.  That's a fair price that gives us both a good deal.",8750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I'm not willing to give up too much more. How about we meet at $9,200? It's still a good compromise that reflects the product's value to me, and I'm willing to make it happen.",9200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility.  However, $9,200 is still a bit out of my price range. Let's try $8,900. That's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close the deal at that point.",8900.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting close! I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm still getting a good deal. How about we meet at $9,100? It's a small step back, but I think it's a fair compromise.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to finding a fair price. Let's try $9,000.  This is a good compromise for both of us, and I'm sure we can close the deal right here.",9000.0,Bob,8,
