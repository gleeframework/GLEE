"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $9,000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. It's a fair compromise, considering the product's worth to you is $10,000.",8500.0,Alice,3,
