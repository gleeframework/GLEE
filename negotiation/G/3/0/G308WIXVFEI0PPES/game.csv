"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $13,500 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for it. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value and the market price. Can you consider my offer?",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer.  While I appreciate your interest, $11,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Could you do $12,500? I'm confident this product will bring you significant value.",12500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable paying $12,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $12,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise. Can you consider my revised offer?",12000.0,Bob,4,
