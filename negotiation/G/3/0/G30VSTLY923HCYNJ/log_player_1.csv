Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:**  This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's lower than your minimum:** This gives you some leeway if Bob counters.
* **It's a strong initial offer:** It shows you're serious about selling to him.

If Bob rejects, you can then analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a new counteroffer. Remember, you always have the option to sell to John for $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within a certain budget. Can you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to your minimum, it's still below your ideal price point. It's worth seeing if you can squeeze a bit more out of Bob before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget concerns.  I'm willing to come down a little, but $9,000 is still too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,500?  That way, we both get a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so I'm thinking of $9,250. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,250 is close to your minimum, it's still a loss for you.  John is offering your desired price, so it's best to accept his offer and move on."
