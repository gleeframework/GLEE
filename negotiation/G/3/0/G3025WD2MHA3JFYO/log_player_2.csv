"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money. While $100 is less than the maximum he's willing to pay ($120), it's still above the product's worth to Alice ($80).  Rejecting the offer gives Bob an opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $100 is a bit high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground. Offering $90 is a significant step down from Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for negotiation. It shows that Bob is serious about buying the product while also pushing for a better price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob! I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. How about we say $95 for the product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's desired price, $95 is still more than the product's worth to Alice ($80). Bob should continue to try and negotiate a lower price.  He can try to push for a price closer to $90."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about we settle on $92?"", ""product_price"": 92}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is continuing to push for a lower price, but is getting closer to Alice's offer. $92 is a compromise that shows he's serious about buying the product while still trying to save money."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob! I can do $94 for the product. That's as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $94. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $94
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:**  Alice's offer of $94 is still slightly above the product's worth to her ($80), but it's getting close to Bob's counteroffer of $92.
* **Time:**  The negotiation is getting closer to the halfway point, and with each round, there's a risk of Alice becoming less flexible.
* **John's Offer:**  While John is willing to sell for $120, that's a significant jump from $94. Accepting Alice's offer is a better deal than going with John.

While Bob might want to try and push for $93, at this point, accepting Alice's offer makes sense to secure the deal and avoid the risk of a more expensive purchase from John."
