Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to pay $60 for it. Can we meet in the middle at $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't do $90, I could come down to $110.  This product is truly worth it, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $90, so I'll offer $95 for the product. Can we meet in the middle at $97.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

While I could push for more, accepting Bob's offer of $97.50 is a good deal.  It surpasses my minimum and avoids the risk of him walking away."
