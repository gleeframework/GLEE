"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with an offer of $900,000 for the product. What are your thoughts?",900000.0,Alice,1,,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm very interested in this product, however, I think $900,000 is a bit high. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer,850000.0
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer,
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $850,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still hoping to land closer to my initial offer. Would you be willing to consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,4,,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer,825000.0
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're still looking to negotiate a price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $850,000, which would be $800,000. However, I'm willing to compromise a bit and offer it to you for $825,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer,
"Alice, you've been very reasonable and I appreciate that.  $825,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like.  How about we settle this right now at $780,000?  This saves us both time and gets the deal done.",780000.0,Bob,6,,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer,795000.0
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $780,000. I'm willing to make one more compromise, and I'm offering the product to you for $795,000. This is the closest I'm willing to get to your offer, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",795000.0,Alice,7,,
