"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe will be a valuable asset for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,200,000, reflecting the significant value it brings. I'm confident we can reach an agreement that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this price reflects the value I see in the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it. I'm looking forward to hearing your thoughts on this counteroffer.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge the value you see in the product,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential it holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, but it still allows me to achieve a fair return on the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'd like to make another counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this price is more in line with my budget and the value I see in the product. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle and make a deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
