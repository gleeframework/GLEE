Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I acknowledge the value you see in the product,  $900,000 doesn't quite reflect the full potential it holds. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price represents a significant compromise on my end, but it still allows me to achieve a fair return on the value I've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.
