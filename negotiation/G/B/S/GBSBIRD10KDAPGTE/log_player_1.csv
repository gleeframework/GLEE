"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a strong opening position,  allowing for potential negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll gauge his interest and adjust my counteroffer accordingly. I'm confident I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to sell to John for $800,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not ready to settle just yet. I'll counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can find a middle ground. There's still potential to get a better price, and I want to explore that before selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $950,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still confident in the product's value. This counteroffer allows for more room to bargain while also leaving some space for a potential compromise in the next rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $850,000 is getting closer to my desired price. While I'd like to push for more, accepting his offer ensures a good profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation. I'm confident that I can secure a better price in the future with other buyers."
