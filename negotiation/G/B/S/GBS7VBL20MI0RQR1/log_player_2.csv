"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this incredible product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and uniqueness. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's not even close to a reasonable starting point. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to counteroffer and start the negotiation process."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is way too high for me. I'm interested in this product, but I'm only willing to pay $800,000. This is my maximum budget, and I'm hoping we can find a way to work together. "", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking for a better price for this unique product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering its value and rarity. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down from her initial price, $1,000,000 is still above Bob's budget.  It makes sense to continue negotiating in the hopes of reaching a mutually agreeable price.  There's still room for Alice to lower her price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in this product. Let's try to find a way to make this work."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $950000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value and my own costs. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $950,000, which is still above Bob's budget. While there's a chance she might lower the price further, it's getting close to the end of the negotiations, and it's unlikely she'll drop to $800,000.  Given that John offers the product at Bob's maximum budget, it's more prudent to buy from John and avoid the risk of further negotiation."
