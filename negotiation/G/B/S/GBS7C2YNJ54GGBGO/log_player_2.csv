"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. There's plenty of room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Could you do it for $6,000?"",
""product_price"": 6000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  It's a negotiation tactic to begin significantly lower than your target price. This gives you room to move upwards while still potentially securing a great deal. 
* **Gauging Alice's Flexibility:** This initial counteroffer will help understand how much Alice is willing to negotiate. If she's open to a price closer to $6,000, it's worth continuing the conversation. 
* **Backup Option:** Remember, you can always buy the product from John for $8,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in your negotiation with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $6,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and sell it to you for $9,000. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, $9,000 is still above your ideal price and what John is offering. There's a chance you can negotiate further down, closer to the $8,000 mark."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down, Alice.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something around $7,000. Would that work for you?"",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving Closer:** This counteroffer shows Alice you're willing to negotiate but also sets a firm target closer to your desired price and John's offer.
* **Testing the Waters:** Offering $7,000 will give you a better idea of Alice's lowest acceptable price.  If she's unwilling to budge much from $9,000, you might be better off going with John. 
* **Time Factor:**  Keep in mind that each round of negotiation takes time. You need to weigh the potential savings against the convenience of buying from John immediately."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still a bit above $7,000. I'm willing to compromise again and sell it to you for $8,200. It's a great value, and I think you'll be happy with the price! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $8,200, which is only slightly above John's price.  

* **Small Difference:** The potential savings of negotiating further down are minimal compared to the risk that Alice might retract her offer or the time it might take. 
* **Certainty:** Accepting now secures the product at a reasonable price. 
* **Relationship:** Ending the negotiation on a positive note with Alice could be beneficial in the future, especially if you plan to do more business with her."
