"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $7,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my asking price.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. $8,500 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about we settle at $7,750? ",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find the best price.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $7,750 is still too low for me. How about we meet at $8,250? This would be a fair compromise, and I think it's a price we can both agree on.",8250.0,Alice,5,
