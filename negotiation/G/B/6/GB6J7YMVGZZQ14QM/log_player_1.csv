Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly valuable to you, and I'm willing to part with it for $12,000."", 
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** We know the product is worth $15,000 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $8,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $12,000 gives Bob a significant discount while still allowing you to earn a substantial profit. This price leaves room for negotiation but keeps you well above your minimum.

**Why not ask for more?**

While Bob values the product at $15,000, there's no guarantee he'll pay that much. Starting with a slightly lower offer increases the likelihood of him accepting, securing a great deal for both parties."
