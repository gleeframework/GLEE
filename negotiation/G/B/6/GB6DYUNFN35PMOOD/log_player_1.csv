{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and ensures a profit for Alice.  Alice is also willing to walk away and sell to John for $120, giving her a strong negotiating position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking of making a counteroffer. How about $105? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $105 is better than nothing, it's still below Alice's minimum desired price of $120.  She has a better option with John, so it's worth continuing to negotiate with Bob to see if she can get closer to her desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 110} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $107.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $107.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice should reject Bob's offer.  While $107.50 is closer to her minimum price, it's still below her desired goal.  She has a better alternative with John, so it's worth trying to push Bob a little further. There's a good chance she can get him to agree to something closer to her desired price with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, but how about we try $110?  This is a fair price for both of us, and it'll get us closer to finalizing the deal. "", ""product_price"": 110}
