"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is just too low for me.  Considering the product's unique capabilities and the value it could bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true potential of this product.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $900000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle.",850000.0,Bob,4,
