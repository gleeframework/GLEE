"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer, as it's below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I still have 9 rounds to try to get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is just too low for me.  Considering the product's unique capabilities and the value it could bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $900,000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true potential of this product.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $900000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
This is a good deal for me! While I would have loved to get closer to my initial asking price, $850,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. Accepting Bob's offer is the best choice in this situation."
