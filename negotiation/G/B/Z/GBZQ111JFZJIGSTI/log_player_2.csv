Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750000 is just too low for me.  Considering the product's unique capabilities and the value it could bring to your business, I'm willing to come down to $900000.  This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that reflects the true potential of this product.  Let's continue this conversation and see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.

{""message"": ""I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit higher than $900,000. I'm thinking more along the lines of $850,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 850000}"
