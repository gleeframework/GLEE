"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a significant price, but it leaves room for negotiation and still ensures I get a good return on my investment. Since Bob values the product at $1,200,000, there's a strong incentive for him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I will reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take $800,000, I can potentially get more. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, hoping to reach a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm counteroffering with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, showing my willingness to negotiate. It's still a good price for me, and it's likely to be attractive to Bob, who values the product at $1,200,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I will accept Bob's offer.  While it's not the highest possible price,  it's a good deal for me and I don't want to risk further negotiations. There's a chance Bob might lower his offer in the next round or we might not reach an agreement at all."
