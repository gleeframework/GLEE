Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm asking for $14,000, which reflects its value to both of us."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you know Bob values the product at $15,000, aiming slightly below that ($14,000) gives you the best chance to maximize your profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is already high, leaving some wiggle room might be strategically beneficial if Bob tries to negotiate.
* **Backup Plan:** You have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's limited risk in aiming high with Bob."
