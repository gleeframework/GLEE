Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm asking for $2,000,000. I believe this reflects its true worth in the market. What do you say?"",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. 
* **Potential for higher profit:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000, but that doesn't mean he wouldn't be willing to pay more.  A higher offer tests his upper limit. 
* **Confident language:** The message uses language that conveys value and encourages Bob to seriously consider the offer.

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy.  You could choose a different starting price and message based on your assessment of Bob's personality and negotiating style."
