"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product, which I believe will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000, a price that I believe reflects its worth to you while also being a fair deal for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for you than buying from John.**  You'd save $300,000 by accepting Alice's offer.
* **Even though the product is worth less to Alice, it's still a good deal for you.** You're getting it for less than your maximum value."
