Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $145. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", 
""product_price"": 145
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it at $150, there's a chance Bob might accept a slightly lower price. This maximizes your potential profit from Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $145 leaves a small window for Bob to counter-offer if he's very interested, potentially getting you even closer to $150.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  Mentioning a ""limited time"" adds a bit of urgency for Bob to make a decision.

It's important to note that there's no guarantee Bob will accept $145. However, this strategy balances risk and reward by aiming for the highest possible price Bob might be willing to pay while still ensuring you can sell it for your minimum acceptable price to John."
