"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value and quality, we believe it's worth $12,000. We understand that it might be an investment for you, but we're confident it will provide significant benefits. Let's discuss how we can make this work for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is way over his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000.  He should counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your product seems great, but $12,000 is significantly outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it.  This is my best offer, considering my budget and the product's value to me. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. After careful consideration, I would like to propose a price of $10,000 for the product. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it holds for both of us. I believe this offer will meet your budget constraints while still allowing us to achieve a mutually beneficial transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than her initial price, it's still over his budget. He can get the same product from John for $8,000, so he should try to negotiate a lower price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us. How about $9,000? It's a significant step closer to my budget, and I'm hopeful we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. In light of your offer, I would like to propose a price of $9,500 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable compromise that respects both our positions. I hope this proposal will facilitate a successful transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John. Alice's offer of $9,500 is still higher than what Bob is willing to pay, and he has already spent 4 rounds negotiating with her. At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy the product from John and avoid further negotiation."
