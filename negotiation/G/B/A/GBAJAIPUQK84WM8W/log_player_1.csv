Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:** Since Bob values the product at $10,000, starting with a higher offer of $15,000 allows room for negotiation and potentially a higher profit margin for Alice. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John willing to buy the product at $10,000, ensuring she doesn't have to go below her minimum.
* **Strategic Approach:**  By positioning the offer as an exclusive opportunity before a public listing, Alice adds a sense of urgency and value.

**Important Note:**  This is a starting point. Depending on Bob's response and negotiation skills, Alice can adjust her price accordingly, always keeping her minimum of $10,000 in mind."
