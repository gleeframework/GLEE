Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, as I know it would be valuable to you. I'm asking for $20,000.  Let me know what you think!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good idea to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a better deal. 
* **Justification:** While not explicitly stated in the message, the tone suggests the product's value warrants the higher price. This can make Bob more receptive than a simple, unjustified number. 
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed sale at $15,000 with John, so there's less pressure to settle for a low offer from Bob."
