{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,500,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its value and potential. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum, giving you room to negotiate down if needed. It also establishes a positive tone by calling it a ""fair price"" and offering to hear Bob's thoughts."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $950,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to compromise, but I need a price closer to my original offer. Let's meet in the middle. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,250,000. This reflects a significant discount from my initial price, and hopefully, it's a reasonable figure for you as well."", ""product_price"": 1250000} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your willingness to negotiate, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1100000. I hope this proposal is acceptable and we can move forward with the transaction. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,100,000 is above my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While it's less than I initially hoped for, it's a good deal considering the potential for further negotiation with Bob might not yield a significantly higher price.  It's also better than selling to John for $1,200,000.  Therefore, I will accept Bob's offer."
