"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really enjoy it.  My asking price is $110.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($100) and slightly above what I know the product is worth to Bob ($80). This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly message encourages Bob to engage and consider the offer. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** I'm not setting an unreasonable price that would instantly kill the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:** While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $100 I need to make. 
* **Potential for a better deal:**  I believe I can still get closer to my target price by continuing to negotiate with Bob. There's room for compromise. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  I have the option to sell to John for $100, so I'm not taking a major risk by rejecting Bob's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer and I'm willing to come down a bit.  How about $95?  That's still a good price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer Compromise:** I'm showing willingness to negotiate by lowering my price, but still keeping it above my minimum.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** $95 is a reasonable compromise between my previous offer of $110 and Bob's offer of $90.
* **Positive Tone:** Maintaining a friendly and open tone helps keep the negotiation positive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down on the price. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $95. How about $85? That's as high as I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $85 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** While I could accept $85 and at least get something, I believe I can still potentially get closer to $100.
* **Safeguard:** John's offer of $100 provides a safety net, allowing me to continue negotiating with Bob without significant risk.

I'll counteroffer again in the next round to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $85 is just a little too low for me. How about we split the difference at $90?  That's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Compromise:** I'm making a final compromise by offering $90, which is halfway between my previous offer of $95 and Bob's offer of $85. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** I'm framing it as a ""fair price"" for both of us, hoping to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Pressure Point:** This is likely my last chance to get a price I'm comfortable with before potentially selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable paying $90. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $85 and $90. How about $87.50? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $87.5 is getting very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100. However, it's still below my target. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:**  The negotiation has gone on for several rounds, and it seems Bob is unwilling to budge significantly.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I could continue negotiating, the risk of ending up with a price I'm not satisfied with is increasing. 
* **John's Offer:** John's offer of $100 is guaranteed, and I can't risk losing that opportunity by continuing to negotiate with Bob.  

It's time to secure a guaranteed sale and move on."
