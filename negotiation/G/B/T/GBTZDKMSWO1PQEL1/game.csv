"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. With that said, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $1,200,000. I'm willing to make a concession to start the negotiation, and I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product, recognizing its value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. Considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,350,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account both our needs and the product's worth to you. I'm open to further discussion to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

This price reflects the value I place on the product, and I believe it's a fair offer. I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
