"Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from it.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However,  $12000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13500, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",13000.0,Bob,4,
