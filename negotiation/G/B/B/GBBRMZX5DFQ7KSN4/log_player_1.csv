{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe will be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $15,000.  This is a fair price considering its worth to me, and I believe it's a good deal for you as well. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12000. I believe that's a fair price considering the value I can get from it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is better than John's offer, I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product and your offer. However,  $12,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $13,500, which still leaves room for a good profit for both of us.  Let me know if you're interested in this price."", ""product_price"": 13500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $13500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $13000. I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'll accept Bob's offer of $13,000. This is a good price considering the risk of further negotiation and the fact that John is offering $10,000. I'm happy with this outcome."
