"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product that I think you'll love. I'm asking for $110 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value ($80) but still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price ($120). This gives Bob room to negotiate while ensuring I don't undervalue the product from the start.
* **Positive and Engaging:** My message is friendly and inviting, creating a good starting point for the negotiation. 

I'm aiming to see if Bob is willing to pay more than his initial perceived value, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. Would you be willing to consider $90 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low.** While it's closer to my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell for less than $100 at this point.
* **Negotiation is important:**  There are still rounds left, and I believe I can potentially get closer to my desired price. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps me in the driver's seat of the negotiation. 

I will counter with a slightly lower price in the next round, hoping to find a compromise that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $90 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my asking price. Would you be willing to go up to $100? It's a fair price for a product of this quality."", ""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromising Slightly:** I'm lowering my price by $10, showing flexibility and a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the quality of the product to justify the price. 
* **Appeal to Fairness:** Using the word ""fair"" suggests a mutually beneficial outcome, making it more likely Bob will consider the counteroffer.

I believe $100 is a good compromise that gives Bob a better price while still allowing me to achieve a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you're trying to get closer to your asking price, but I'm still a bit hesitant. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still above my minimum:**  While $95 is closer to my minimum acceptable price ($120), it's still below what I believe the product is worth, considering John is willing to pay $120. 
* **Potential for higher offer:**  With more rounds left, I'm confident I can push Bob closer to my desired price.
* **Maintaining leverage:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I maintain control of the negotiation and avoid settling for a price that doesn't meet my needs. 

I will counteroffer again in the next round, aiming to get closer to $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're serious about getting this product. How about we split the difference and go with $97.50?  That way, we both can walk away happy with a good deal."", ""product_price"": 97.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm offering a price that's right in between our last offers, demonstrating a genuine willingness to compromise. 
* **Positive framing:** Using phrases like ""good deal"" and ""walk away happy"" emphasize the win-win potential of the deal.
* **Maintaining a firm stance:** I'm still holding out for a price closer to my desired $100, but offering a middle ground shows flexibility. 

At this point, we're getting closer to a potential agreement. I hope Bob will see this as a fair offer and accept it. However, if he rejects it, I'll have to weigh the risks of further negotiation against selling to John for a guaranteed $120."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $97.50. Would you be willing to go down to $92? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only 4 rounds left, the risk of further negotiation outweighs the potential benefit. 
* **John's Offer is Secure:**  I have a guaranteed $120 from John, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price than anything Bob has offered.
* **Limited Upside:** Bob's offer of $92 is significantly lower than my desired price, and the chance of him going higher in the remaining rounds is slim.

While I would prefer to sell the product to Bob, the certainty of John's offer and the dwindling negotiation time make selling to John the best decision at this point."
