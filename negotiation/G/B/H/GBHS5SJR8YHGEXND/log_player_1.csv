You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

Bob's offer:

While Bob is getting closer to my minimum price, it's unlikely he'll reach $80. It's time to cut my losses and take John's guaranteed offer."
