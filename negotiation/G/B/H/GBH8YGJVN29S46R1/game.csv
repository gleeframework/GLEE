"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $800000. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the generous starting point.  While I'm interested in the product, $800000 is a bit too steep for me right now. I'm willing to pay $650000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $650000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $725000. What do you think?",725000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $725000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $700000. This feels like a fair compromise, and I'm eager to close the deal.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $700000. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it to you for $750000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",750000.0,Alice,5,
