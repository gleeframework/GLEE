"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This offer is fair, considering your value for the product is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
