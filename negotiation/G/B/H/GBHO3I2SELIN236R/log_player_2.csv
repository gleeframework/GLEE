"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your desired price point. You can definitely do better. There's room to negotiate.  It's not worthwhile to buy from John at that price yet."

{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me, but $1,300,000 is a bit high for my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for it. This offer is fair, considering your value for the product is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $1,300,000 is a bit high for your budget, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to me is $1,200,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $1,200,000, which is exactly her own valuation of the product.  This means there's no more room for her to go lower. It's a good deal for you because you're getting the product for $100,000 less than what it's worth to you.  Buying from John would cost you $300,000 more."
