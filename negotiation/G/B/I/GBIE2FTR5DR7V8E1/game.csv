"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,100,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,250,000? This is a fair price considering its potential returns.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems we're getting closer.  While $1,175,000 is still under my ideal price, I'm willing to come down slightly.  Would you consider $1,210,000?  I believe this reflects the true value of the product while finding some common ground.",1210000.0,Alice,5,
