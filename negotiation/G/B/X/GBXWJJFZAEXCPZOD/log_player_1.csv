Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, the price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase the product for $1,100,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is tempting, it's still significantly lower than my target price. I have room to negotiate and believe I can secure a better deal. Selling to John is my safety net, but I'm not ready to settle for that just yet."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be frank, I have a budget I need to stick to. Could we make it work at $1,150,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

Bob is clearly interested and getting closer to my minimum. I'll push a little harder in the next round to see if I can secure a higher price before considering accepting."
