"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm definitely interested in the product, but $11,500 is a little steep for me. Would you be willing to come down to $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That's still a great price for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand it's a balance, Alice. How about we settle at $9,750? It's a fair compromise, don't you think?",9750.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm still not quite there yet. Let's split the difference again - $10,125.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to move forward with this deal.",10125.0,Alice,5,
