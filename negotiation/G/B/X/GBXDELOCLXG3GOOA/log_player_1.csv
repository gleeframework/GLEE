Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $175 is a good starting point. It's above Bob's perceived value, but it gives room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and friendly, encouraging Bob to consider the offer. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  This price allows for a potential counteroffer from Bob, which will give me the chance to negotiate a price closer to my minimum.
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing I can sell to John for $150 gives me a safety net if Bob won't budge."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $120. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $120 is well below my minimum of $150. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** I believe I can get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer. 
* **John is a safety net:** Even if the negotiations with Bob fail, I can still sell to John for $150, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $120 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $140? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob:** My counteroffer of $140 is still above my minimum, but it shows willingness to compromise and signals that I am open to negotiation. 
* **Positive message:**  My message remains positive and focuses on a ""fair price"" to encourage Bob to see the value in my offer. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  While $140 is a good price, I haven't gone too low yet.  This allows me to potentially get closer to my target price if Bob wants to counter again."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $140 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $110. I really like the product, but I need to stick to my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $110 is significantly below my minimum price of $150, and even further from my desired price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** If I reject this offer and make a counteroffer, I'm not sure if Bob will be willing to negotiate further. There's a chance he'll walk away, leaving me with nothing.
* **John provides a guaranteed profit:** Selling to John for $150 ensures I make a profit. This is the safest and most profitable option at this point."
