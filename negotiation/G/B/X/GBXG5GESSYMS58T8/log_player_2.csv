"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $140. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and John's offer. You should definitely try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but that's quite a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. Would you consider $80?"",
""product_price"": 80
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting significantly lower than Alice's initial offer to give us room to negotiate upwards. This tactic might encourage Alice to counter with a more reasonable price.
* **Polite & Direct:** The message is polite but clearly states our position that the initial offer is too high.  
* **Aiming for Savings:**  Our goal is to maximize savings, and offering $80 puts us in a good position to potentially get the product well below John's $100 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is too low for me. Could you meet me halfway at $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice moved closer to your desired price, $110 is still above your $100 limit and John's offer.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate further.  Alice might be willing to come down a little more, especially since you've indicated a willingness to walk away by having John's offer as backup."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand we're both trying to find a fair price, Alice.  How about $95? That's a significant move on my part, and gets us closer to a deal."",
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer, but keeping it below both our budget and John's price.  This shows willingness to compromise but maintains a firm boundary.
* **Highlighting Movement:**  We want Alice to recognize we're negotiating in good faith and making concessions. 
* **Urgency (Subtle):** By suggesting this gets us ""closer to a deal"", we're subtly implying time is a factor, without issuing a direct ultimatum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I see you're serious about this. Let's close this deal at $105. This is my final offer, take it or leave it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has declared this her final offer, removing any further negotiation potential.
* **Above Budget:**  Even though Alice came down significantly, $105 is still above your $100 maximum budget.
* **John's Guarantee:** You have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $100, ensuring you don't overpay. 

While you could try to push Alice further, it's risky. It's better to secure the product at your target price from John."
