Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,000. I believe it offers significant value, even at this price point."",
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to $15,000 as possible, but we also want to make the offer enticing to Bob.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** While this offer is higher than Bob's perceived value, it leaves some space for potential negotiation if he's particularly interested. 
* **Guaranteed Sale:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have a guaranteed sale to John at $15,000.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob while ensuring we don't lose the sale entirely."
