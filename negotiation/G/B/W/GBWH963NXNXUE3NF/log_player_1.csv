"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 135}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $135. This is a fair starting point, giving Bob some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $120 is my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for that right away. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 128}
```

I'm going to counter with $128.  This is a slight concession from my initial offer but still leaves me with a profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to meet me halfway."
