"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is significantly higher than what I need to obtain. I'm offering it to you for $1,000,000, a price that allows us both to benefit from this transaction. This is a limited-time offer, as I have another interested party, John, who's willing to purchase it for $800,000. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Value to you:** The product is worth $1,200,000 to you.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000.
* **John's price:** John is selling the product for $1,200,000.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $200,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though you're paying more than Alice's perceived value, you still get a significant discount on the product's worth to you."
