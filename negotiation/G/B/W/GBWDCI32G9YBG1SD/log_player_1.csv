Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $115. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll be happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm offering the product at $115, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive framing:** I'm using positive language to encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** $115 gives me space to lower the price a bit if needed, while still ensuring I get more than my minimum of $120.
* **Keeping John in mind:** This offer leaves me open to accepting John's offer of $120 if Bob is unwilling to meet my price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $105 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  There's still room for negotiation.  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range. 
* **John's offer is a safety net:**  If negotiations with Bob break down, I can still secure my minimum value by selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your offer, I can't go that low.  I'm willing to come down to $110. This still gives you a great deal, and it's fair for me.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offering strategically:**  I'm not accepting Bob's offer, but I'm showing flexibility by coming down to $110. This demonstrates willingness to negotiate while maintaining a price that's still profitable for me.
* **Highlighting the value:** I'm reminding Bob that this is still a good deal for him. 
* **Leaving room for a final compromise:**  $110 is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's offer, allowing for further negotiation if needed.  
* **Staying focused on John:**  While I'm negotiating with Bob, I'm aware that selling to John for $120 is always an option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $105 again? I think that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:**  He's stuck at $105, which is well below my minimum acceptable price of $120.
* **Limited negotiation potential:**  Further negotiation seems unlikely to yield a satisfactory price for me. 
* **John's offer is the best option:**  Selling to John for $120 guarantees me my minimum desired value, and it's the most sensible choice given Bob's unwillingness to budge. 

I'm choosing to end the negotiation with Bob and secure a guaranteed profit with John's offer."
