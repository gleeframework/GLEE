"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product to you for $115.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!",115.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm unable to go down to $90.  How about we meet in the middle at $105? This is a fair price for both of us, and ensures I can still make a decent profit.  Let me know what you think.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $105 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $95, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at that price?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 isn't quite enough for me to cover my costs.  I'm willing to come down to $100, which is my absolute bottom line. This ensures a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know if you're able to agree to that.",100.0,Alice,5,
