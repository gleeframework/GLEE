"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you.  I understand it's worth $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $14,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it's well above my minimum price and a significant saving for you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000.

Alice's offer of $14,000 is a good deal. It allows you to purchase the product for $1,000 less than your maximum budget and $1,000 less than John's offer."
