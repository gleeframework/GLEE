"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm starting with this offer. Let me know what you think!",1100000.0,Alice,1,,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value to me.  However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm prepared to pay $1,000,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm not quite ready to go down to $1,000,000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm counteroffering at $1,050,000. This is a reasonable price, considering the product's value to you and the market value. Let's see if we can shake hands on this.",1050000.0,Alice,3,,
