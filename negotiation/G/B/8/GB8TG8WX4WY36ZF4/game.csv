"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you. I'm asking for $10,000, which is a fair price considering its value. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $8,500 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference.  I'm willing to come down to $9,250.  This is a fair price that acknowledges the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for me.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,250 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer of $8,500, which would be $9,000. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually agreeable price.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $9,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit more, but I need to be at least $9,125 to make this work. This price still leaves some room for you to get a good deal, and it ensures I'm able to make a fair profit. What do you think?",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,125 is a bit of a stretch for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 was a bit of a stretch, so I'll try to meet you in the middle from $9,125, which would be $9,062.50. I hope we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9062.5,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that we're close, but I need to be at $9,100 to make this work. This is a fair price that considers the value of the product and lets us both walk away happy. It's just a small adjustment from your last offer, and it shows you're serious about closing this deal. Let's make this happen.",9100.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $9,100 is getting close to my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9,000 was a bit of a stretch, so I'll try to meet you in the middle from $9,100, which would be $9,050. I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial price.",9050.0,Bob,8,
