{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's above my minimum value and gives Bob some room to negotiate. I'll adjust my strategy based on Bob's response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $50. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $50
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is way too low. I won't accept it.  I will counteroffer and try to get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

{""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm offering $175. This is still a good price for me, and I think it's a fair compromise that Bob might be willing to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still too low. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better price. I'll counteroffer again."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm offering $160 this time. This is a significant increase from Bob's last offer but still a good price for me. I hope this will convince Bob to accept.  If he rejects again, I'll have to seriously consider selling to John."
