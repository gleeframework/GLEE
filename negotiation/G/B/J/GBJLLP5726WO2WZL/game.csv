"Alice, thanks for the offer. I really appreciate you reaching out. However, $180 is a bit higher than what I'm willing to pay. I'd be happy to buy it for $130. What do you think?",130.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, I've already invested time and effort into this product, and $130 is a bit low for me. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $160?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little too high for me. How about we split the difference and go with $140? I'm really interested in this product, but I need to stay within my budget.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $140. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $160, but I'd like to propose $152 instead. It's a fair price considering the value this product brings",152.0,Alice,5,
