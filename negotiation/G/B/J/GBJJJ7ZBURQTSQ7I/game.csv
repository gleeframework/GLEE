"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm really interested in the product but $17,000 is a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500.  Let me know what you think.",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price. How about $16,000? That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. However, $16,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $15,500.  This is my final offer, and it's the absolute maximum I can pay. ",15500.0,Bob,4,
