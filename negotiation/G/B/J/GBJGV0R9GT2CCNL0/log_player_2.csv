Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair starting point."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $16,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,000

Alice is coming down, but it's still above my ideal price and what John offers. I'll counteroffer again to see if there's more room for negotiation."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to think about my costs. How about we try $16,500? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $16,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $16,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is barely budging on her price. It seems unlikely she'll come down to a price that makes it worthwhile to continue negotiating. I can get the product for $15,000 from John, which is a better use of my time and budget."
