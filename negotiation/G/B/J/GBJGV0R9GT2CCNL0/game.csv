"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the enthusiasm, but $18,000 is a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $12,000? I think that's a fair starting point.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a better price, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, but I need to make a profit. I can do $16,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $14,000? That's a fair deal for both of us, I believe.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000 yet. I'm willing to go a bit higher, but I need to think about my costs. How about we try $16,500? It's a compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",16500.0,Alice,5,
