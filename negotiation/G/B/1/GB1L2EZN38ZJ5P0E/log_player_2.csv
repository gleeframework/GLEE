"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $120 to Bob, and Alice is offering it for $110. This is a good deal, but Bob can potentially save more money by negotiating.  He should reject the offer and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm really interested in the product, but $110 is a bit higher than I'm willing to go right now.  Would you consider $105?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think $108 is the lowest I can go. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has lowered her price to $108. This is still a good deal for Bob as he is willing to pay up to $120.  There's a chance that Bob could negotiate further, but there's also a chance that Alice will walk away from the deal. It's safer for Bob to accept the offer and secure the product for a price lower than what he'd pay from John."
