"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000.  It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $15,000 to you! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly below Bob's perceived value. This allows room for negotiation while still ensuring a good profit for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,500. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'll try to counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $12,500 is a good price, I'm looking for a bit more. How about we split the difference and settle on $13,250? It's a fair price that's closer to my minimum acceptable value."", ""product_price"": 13250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to go down to $12,750? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $12,750 is above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000 and it's close enough to his last counteroffer that I'm willing to accept it.  There's no guarantee I'll get a better offer from him in the future and the risk of him walking away completely is high."
