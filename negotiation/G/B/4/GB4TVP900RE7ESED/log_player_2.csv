"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's priced at $15500, which I think is fair considering its worth to you. If you're interested, let me know and we can discuss further details. If not, I have another buyer lined up who's willing to pay my minimum price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

You are willing to pay a maximum of $15,000 for the product. Alice's offer of $15,500 exceeds your budget.  Since you have an alternative option to buy the product from John for $15,000, rejecting Alice's offer is the best decision to save money."
