"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you.",18000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer but $18,000 is a bit high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm only able to go up to $13,000. What do you think?",13000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you.",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $16,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go to $14,000. Let's find a middle ground.",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go below $16,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $15,500. This is as low as I can go without losing money on the deal.",15500.0,Alice,5,
