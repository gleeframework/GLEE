Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. This is a great price considering its value to you.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** This gives Bob a reason to counter-offer and potentially reach a mutually beneficial price.
* **Protecting my minimum:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can always go to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me. I'd be willing to pay $650,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum:** $650,000 is well below my minimum of $1,000,000.
* **I have a better option:**  I can sell to John for $1,000,000, so accepting Bob's offer would be a significant loss.
* **Counter-offering is a possibility:** While I'm not happy with Bob's offer, I'm not ready to give up completely. I can try to negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $650,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product to you. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:** I'm meeting Bob halfway by reducing my price from $900,000 to $850,000. This shows I'm willing to negotiate and reach a compromise.
* **Still above my minimum:** $850,000 is still above my minimum of $1,000,000. If Bob rejects, I can still sell to John.
* **Leaving room for further negotiation:** There's still room for Bob to counter-offer, potentially reaching a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand the value of the product, but I'm on a tight budget. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below my minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Bob's ""final offer"" is not binding:** He might be willing to negotiate further if I push back. 
* **I have a better alternative:**  I can sell to John for $1,000,000, which is a much better outcome.

I'm going to try one more counter-offer to see if I can get closer to my desired price, but if Bob refuses, I'll go with John."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $800,000 as a final offer. This is a significant compromise, and I truly believe this product is worth every penny.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final offer:** I'm signaling that this is my final offer, hoping to create some urgency and encourage Bob to accept.
* **Slight compromise:**  I'm coming down to $800,000, which is closer to Bob's offer but still significantly above my minimum.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value, hoping to make him realize that $800,000 is a fair price.
* **Preparing for a possible ""no"":** If Bob still rejects, I'm ready to sell to John for $1,000,000."
