"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $1,600,000 is far more than Bob is willing to pay, and he can get the same product from John for a much lower price.  There's no reason to accept Alice's initial offer."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about meeting halfway at $1,300,000? This reflects the product's worth while acknowledging your enthusiasm. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While it's a step down from her original offer, it's still higher than Bob is willing to pay.  He has the option of buying from John for $1,000,000, making Alice's counteroffer unattractive. Bob should continue to negotiate with Alice to see if she'll come down further."
