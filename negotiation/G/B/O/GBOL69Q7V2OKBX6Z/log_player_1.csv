Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm asking for $115 for it."", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price slightly above my minimum of $100. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Attractive Offer:** $115 is still a good deal for Bob, as the product is worth $120 to him. 
* **Room for Compromise:** This initial price leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without me feeling pressured to sell for less than I'd like. 

Let's see what Bob says!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you be willing to consider $100 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** I want to earn as much as possible.  
* **Bob's Offer:**  While $100 is my minimum, it's not my ideal outcome. 
* **Counteroffer Potential:** I can still potentially get a better price by rejecting Bob's offer and making a counteroffer.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I signal my willingness to negotiate further, and hopefully, get a price closer to my desired $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you being upfront about your budget. While I'm willing to negotiate, $100 is just a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference at $107.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  My counteroffer is a midpoint between my initial offer and Bob's.  
* **Staying Above Minimum:**  $107.50 is still above my minimum of $100, ensuring I make a profit.
* **Appeal to Reason:** I'm appealing to Bob's desire for a fair deal by suggesting a split of the difference. 

Let's see if Bob is willing to come up a bit!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $105 for the product. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Goal:**  $105 is very close to my desired $107.50.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Rejecting and counteroffering again risks a stalemate. Bob has clearly stated his budget limit.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Selling to John for $100 would be less profitable. 

Accepting Bob's offer is the most logical choice. It ensures a sale and maximizes my profit while keeping the negotiation efficient."
