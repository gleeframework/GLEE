Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value.

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, showing he's serious. While $1,750,000 is less than our desired price, it's still significantly higher than John's offer. Accepting now secures a good profit and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
