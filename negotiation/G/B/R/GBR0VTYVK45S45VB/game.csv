"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $90. I'm willing to pay a fair price, but I'm not willing to go above $120. Can you meet me in the middle?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $90. I'm willing to compromise, though. How about we meet at $105? It's a fair price that still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to my original price than your offer.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $95? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget as much as possible.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about staying within your budget, Bob. I'm willing to make another compromise. How about we meet at $100? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting closer to my original price.",100.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $98? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I'd like to stay within my budget as much as possible.",98.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're getting too close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $102? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my original price.",102.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my target budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $102 and my previous offer of $98. How about we meet at $100.50? I think this is a fair compromise that works for both of us.",100.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair deal. How about we meet at $101? It's still a good deal for you, and it's getting close to my original price.",101.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $100, but that's as low as I can go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'll have to consider buying the product from John for $120.",100.0,Bob,10,
