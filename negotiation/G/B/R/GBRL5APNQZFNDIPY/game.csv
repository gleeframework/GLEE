"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm very interested in this product, but I can only offer $750000 at this time.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your interest in our product, Bob. I understand your current budget constraints. To better align with your financial situation, I would like to propose a revised price of $825000 for the product. This still reflects its true value and provides a good balance between the cost and the benefits it offers to your business.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to adjust the price. While $825000 is closer to my target, I'm still unable to go that high.  I'm prepared to offer $800000 for the product. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it reflects the value I place on it.  I'm hoping we can reach an agreement at this price.",800000.0,Bob,4,
