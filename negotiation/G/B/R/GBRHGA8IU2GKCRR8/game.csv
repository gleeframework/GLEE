"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need something closer to $1,350,000 to make this worthwhile. Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000? I'm confident this price is fair and will allow us both to walk away happy. ",1300000.0,Alice,5,
