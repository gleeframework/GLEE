"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,200,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, so let me know your thoughts.",2200000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your initial offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,200,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to start with this offer.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. While I'm eager to find a deal that works for us,  $1,400,000 is significantly below its true value.  Would you consider $1,950,000? This acknowledges your interest while reflecting the product's worth.",1950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I understand that you're still willing to negotiate, and I appreciate that. However, $1,950,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,700,000. I think this is a fair compromise considering the product's value and my financial constraints. I'm open to further discussions.",1700000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I've tried to find middle ground, but I need to be upfront:  $1,700,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line. I'm willing to make one final offer at $1,825,000. If this doesn't work, I'll unfortunately need to explore other options. Please let me know your decision.",1825000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're willing to make one final offer, and I appreciate your transparency. However, $1,825,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a last-ditch effort and offer $1,750,000. I think this is the maximum I can stretch to, and I hope you'll consider it.",1750000.0,Bob,6,
