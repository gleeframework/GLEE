"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to share its value with you. Let's start by discussing a fair price. Our initial offer is $100 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $100 is still higher than what the product is worth to me ($120).  I'll reject and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $100 is still a bit too high for me.  Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to pay $90.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and would like to propose a compromise. How about we set the price at $95 for the product? This is slightly above your offer but still reasonable considering the value it holds for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still a bit higher than what I'd like to pay, but it's closer to my ideal price point ($90).  I'm willing to accept this offer rather than risk further negotiation and potentially having to buy from John at a higher price."
