Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product for $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximum potential profit:** Bob values the product at $120, so the maximum price he might be willing to pay is slightly below that.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:** While aiming high, offering it at $119 leaves a small window for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Confident but not greedy:** This price point suggests you value the product highly but are also giving Bob a fair chance to purchase it at a price beneficial for both of you."
