"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with an opportunity to acquire our premium product. Given its exceptional quality and value, it's worth $10,000 to me. However, considering its significance to you, I propose a price of $9,500. This offers a substantial return for me while still providing you with a great deal on a product you value at $8,000. I believe this is a win-win situation. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding.",9500.0,Alice,1,
