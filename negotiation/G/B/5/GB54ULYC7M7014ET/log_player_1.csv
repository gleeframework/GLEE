Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** $1,000,000 is well above your minimum of $800,000, ensuring you get a good return.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** By not asking for the full $1,200,000, you create space for Bob to counteroffer without feeling pressured to accept your initial price. 
* **It's a fair offer:** It's significantly less than the value to Bob, giving him a clear incentive to negotiate.

Remember, this is just the first step. You need to be prepared to counteroffer if Bob rejects your initial offer and be ready to sell to John if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, I am only able to pay $950,000 for it. I hope this revised offer meets your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is closer to your minimum, you still have room to negotiate and potentially get a better price.  Rejecting Bob's offer allows you to make a counteroffer and try to secure a price closer to your initial asking price.  

**Next Steps:**

You should make a counteroffer to Bob that is higher than his offer but still lower than your initial offer. For example, you could counter with $975,000. This shows that you are willing to negotiate but also that you believe the product is worth more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a bit higher. I'm willing to come down to $975,000 for the product. This reflects the value and quality, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 975000}
```

This counteroffer is a good balance:

* **Higher than Bob's offer:**  It shows you're willing to negotiate, but not at a price too far below your desired range.
* **Lower than your initial offer:** It shows you're flexible and willing to compromise.
* **Reasonable:**  It's still a good price for both parties, leaving room for further negotiation if needed.

Remember, the goal is to secure the highest price possible, while still being willing to compromise. Keep an eye on the overall value of the product to Bob and your own minimum, and adjust your counteroffers accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your response. I understand your position, but I would like to propose $960,000 for the product. I believe this is a reasonable offer given the value I place on it. I look forward to your consideration. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $960,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $960,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $960,000 is still a bit lower than the $975,000 you were aiming for, it's a reasonable compromise.  

* **Value to You:**  It's significantly higher than your minimum of $800,000, so you'd still be making a good profit. 
* **Value to Bob:** It's closer to the price Bob is willing to pay, and it's likely he won't offer any higher. 
* **Risk of Rejection:** If you reject his offer, you risk further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price, or having to sell to John at $800,000.

**Conclusion:**  Accepting this offer is the best strategy to maximize your profit while minimizing the risk of further negotiation."
