"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price! I'm willing to let it go for $12000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $12,000 is a good deal, Bob can potentially get a better price by counter-offering.  There's a significant difference between $12,000 and Bob's maximum value of $15,000, so it's worth exploring negotiation further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate the discount. However, I'm looking to pay closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to come down a bit? "", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $11500. Is that something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value for Bob:** Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000.
* **Alice's offer:** Alice is offering the product for $11,500.
* **Potential savings:** Bob can save $3,500 compared to buying from John.
* **Negotiation progress:** While Bob could potentially negotiate further, the difference between $11,500 and $10,000 is smaller.  The risk of Alice walking away increases with each round, and the potential savings diminish. 

Accepting Alice's offer is the most rational decision, securing a good price and a positive outcome."
