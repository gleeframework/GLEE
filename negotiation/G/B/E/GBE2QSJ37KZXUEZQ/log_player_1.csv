Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly beneficial for you.  I'm asking for $12,000. It's a fantastic deal for something of this value."", 
""product_price"": 12000
} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Know your worth, but be strategic:** You know you have a backup offer of $8,000, but Bob is willing to pay $15,000. This means there's a potential profit margin of $7,000. 
* **Aim high, but stay reasonable:** Starting with a price of $12,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but still secures a significant profit for you. It's a strong starting point that reflects the product's value to Bob. 
* **Highlight the product's value:**  Emphasize the benefits Bob will gain from the product to justify the price. 
 
**Important Note:** This strategy aims to maximize profit.  There's a chance Bob could reject the offer, but the potential for a higher return is worth the calculated risk."
