"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget. It's a good starting point for negotiation, but there's plenty of room to bring the price down."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above my maximum budget.  It's time to counteroffer again and try to bridge the gap further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's also a significant reduction from your initial offer. Let's try to reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
