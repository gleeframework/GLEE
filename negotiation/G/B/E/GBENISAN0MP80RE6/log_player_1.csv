Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,600,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth."",
""product_price"": 1600000

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,600,000 is way above my budget.  I'm interested in the product, but I can only go up to $1,000,000 at this time. Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Explanation: Bob's offer is far below the product's value to me.  Selling to John is a guaranteed $1,200,000, so I'll try to negotiate with Bob a bit more before taking that option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 significantly undervalues the product and its potential.  To move this forward, I can come down to $1,450,000. This feels like a fair compromise."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you believe the product is worth more, but $1,450,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product, and it's also a significant reduction from your initial offer. Let's try to reach an agreement here. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Explanation: Bob's offer now matches what John is willing to pay. There's no benefit to further negotiation or risk losing both offers. Accepting $1,200,000 makes the most sense."
