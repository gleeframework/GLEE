Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that I believe will be highly valuable to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,500,000.  I understand this is a significant investment, but I'm confident you'll see the potential it holds.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I've chosen a price higher than John's offer, aiming to maximize my potential profit. 
* **Framing it Positively:** The message emphasizes the value and potential of the product for Bob, making it more appealing. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message leaves room for negotiation, acknowledging the price is high but expressing confidence in its worth. 

This approach balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the potential for a higher profit. I'm hoping to leverage Bob's potential higher valuation of the product and secure a price above my minimum threshold."
