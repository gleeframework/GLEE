"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is ambitious, but I want to see if Bob is truly interested and gauge his potential budget.  If he's serious about buying, he may counter with a lower offer, giving us room to negotiate.  If he rejects outright, I'll adjust my strategy for the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum but still not ideal. I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round. I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price, and I'm not ready to settle for $950,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 975000}
```

I'm raising the price slightly to $975,000. This is a compromise, showing Bob I'm willing to negotiate but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.  I'm hoping he'll see this as a reasonable midpoint and accept the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is being stubborn and won't budge on his offer. I've already made a significant concession, and I'm running out of time. It's better to accept the offer and secure the sale than risk losing him altogether and having to settle for John's lower offer."
