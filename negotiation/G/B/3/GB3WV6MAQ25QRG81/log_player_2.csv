"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

The initial offer from Alice is above your maximum budget. It's better to reject and attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, about 40% lower than Alice's initial price. This will hopefully encourage Alice to consider negotiating seriously.  I'm aiming to get close to my maximum budget of $15,000, but leaving some room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above my budget.  While it's closer to my target price, I'm still going to try to negotiate further.  There are still a few rounds to go, and I have the option to buy from John if I'm not satisfied."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm raising my offer slightly from the previous round, but I'm still under my $15,000 limit.  This shows Alice that I'm serious about buying the product, but I'm not willing to go much higher. I hope this will push Alice to accept or make a more reasonable counteroffer."
