Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing it's likely Bob will counter. This gives me room to negotiate while still ensuring I get a good price.  I'll be watching closely to see how he responds and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial price, but I'm not ready to give up just yet. I'm going to make a counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground.  I believe the product is worth more than $1,500,000 and I'm willing to negotiate further to reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from my initial offer, but I'm still confident that the product is worth more than $1,500,000.  By meeting Bob halfway, I'm hoping to signal my willingness to negotiate while still securing a price that reflects the value of the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's counteroffer is getting closer to my minimum but I'm not willing to risk going lower.  There's no guarantee he'll budge further and I'm concerned I might end up selling for less than what John is offering. It's time to cut my losses and sell to John for a guaranteed $1,500,000."
