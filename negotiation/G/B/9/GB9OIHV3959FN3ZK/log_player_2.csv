"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you our product. I believe it's a great opportunity for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than her product's worth ($950,000 vs. $800,000). There is a lot of room for negotiation to get a better price.  Buying from John is not a good option as his price is the highest."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm confident the product is valuable, but I'm only willing to pay $750,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to your business. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $850,000, which is still higher than her product's worth, but it's a significant improvement from her initial offer. This price is also well below the $1,500,000 that John is asking, making it a much more favorable deal. It's worth accepting this offer to avoid further negotiation and secure the product."
