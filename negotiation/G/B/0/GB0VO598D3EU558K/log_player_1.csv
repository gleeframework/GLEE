"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that's worth a lot to me. I'm willing to let it go for $180. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price, but I'm leaving room for negotiation. I want to see if Bob is genuinely interested and what his perceived value is. If he rejects, I'll adjust my offer based on his counteroffer and my understanding of the situation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $120 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is willing to increase his offer, and I want to gather more information about his perceived value of the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $120 is my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my initial asking price.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $150? "", ""product_price"": 150} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so I'd like to propose $135. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  $135 is a good compromise, and I'm happy to close the deal rather than risk further negotiation.  I'm also considering that if I reject, Bob might walk away, and I'd be left with only John's offer of $120."
