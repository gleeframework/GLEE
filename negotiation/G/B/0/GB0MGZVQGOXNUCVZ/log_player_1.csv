Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a possible offer, taking into account Alice's goals and Bob's valuation:

```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $11,500.  It's a great deal for something you'll benefit from significantly."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 (Bob's valuation) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still ensuring Alice gets a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Friendly Message:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, creating a sense of desirability.  It frames the price as a ""great deal,"" subtly encouraging acceptance."
