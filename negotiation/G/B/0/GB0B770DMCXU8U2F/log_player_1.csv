Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! It's worth a lot to me, but I'm willing to negotiate. I'm asking for $11,500. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $11,500 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While $9,000 is more than my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price. I'll counter Bob's offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we split the difference?  $10,250 seems fair to me. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  While $10,250 is closer, it's still a bit more than I was hoping to spend. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While I'm tempted to accept Bob's offer, I want to see if I can get a little closer to $10,000. I'll counter his offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see you're trying to meet me in the middle. Let's try one more time - how about $9,750?  I'm really hoping we can find a deal that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, this is getting close! $9,750 is tempting, but I'm aiming for something closer to $9,600.  Would you be willing to meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600

While I'd like to get closer to $10,000, I'm running out of rounds.  Accepting Bob's offer of $9,600 is the best option at this point."
