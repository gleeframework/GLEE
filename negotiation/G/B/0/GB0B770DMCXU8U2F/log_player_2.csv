Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about we split the difference?  $10,250 seems fair to me. What do you think?

Alice is coming down, but we're still a good bit away from a price I'm fully happy with. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
