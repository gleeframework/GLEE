``` 

I'm starting with a high offer, knowing that I have a backup option with John. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and leaves room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum acceptable price of $8,000. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value. There are still 8 rounds left, and I have time to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. $7,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to negotiate.  I'm happy to accept $9,000.  This gives you a good price while ensuring I get a fair value. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

I'm offering $9,000, which is a compromise between my desired price and Bob's offer.  I'm still above my minimum, but I'm showing willingness to negotiate.  This approach keeps the deal alive and encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.
