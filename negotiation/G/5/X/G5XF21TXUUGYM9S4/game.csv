"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $100 just yet. I'm willing to compromise and offer you a price of $110. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant at $110. I'm willing to meet you at $105. Would you be willing to accept that price?",105.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your hesitation, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not comfortable going as low as $105. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $110 and $105, so I'm offering you a price of $107.50. What do you think?",107.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, but I'm still not comfortable going above $105. I think that's a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to meet you at that point. Would you be willing to accept $105?",105.0,Bob,6,
