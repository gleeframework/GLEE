Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?

 I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $10,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm still aiming for a bit higher. How about $11,000? It's a fair price considering the value you'll get from this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 11000}

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  $9,500 is still better than selling to John, but I'm not willing to drop that low just yet. I think I can still push for a higher price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $9,500 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $9,000 is tempting, I still think I can get a slightly higher price. We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, so I need to be strategic and try to push for a better deal."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm running out of time here, but I'm still open to making a deal.  I'm willing to drop my price to $9,800.  That's a fair price for both of us, and it's the last offer I'm willing to make.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 9800}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit lower on the price. How about we meet at $9,200? I think it's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While I was hoping for a slightly higher price, it's getting close to the end of the rounds and I don't want to risk losing the sale to John. $9,200 is still a decent profit for me, and it's better than selling to John for $8,000."
