I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good price for my product. Let me know what you think!

Alice is now at $1,100,000.  While it's a good offer, there's still some room for negotiation before resorting to buying from John.  I'll counteroffer again and see if we can get closer to my desired price."
