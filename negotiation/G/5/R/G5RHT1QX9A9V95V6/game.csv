"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1,500,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm looking to get a good price for my product. Let me know what you think!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $1,200,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,000,000.  I believe that's a fair price considering the value it brings to me, and it leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm not comfortable going as low as $1,000,000. Considering the value this product brings to you, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference and I'll take it for $1,050,000.  This way, we both save some money and get a deal done.",1050000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to split the difference, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,075,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
