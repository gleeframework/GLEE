Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob's offer:

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10250 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $9750? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

``` 
At this point, it's better to accept Bob's offer of $9,750. You've already rejected his previous offer, and if you reject his current offer, you risk him walking away entirely.  $9,750 is still above your minimum threshold of $8,000, and it's unlikely you'll get a better offer from Bob."
