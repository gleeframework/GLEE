Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000

While I could try to negotiate further, Bob is now offering my minimum acceptable price. Accepting ensures I make a profit and avoids the risk of him lowering his offer or me needing to walk away and sell to John for the same amount."
