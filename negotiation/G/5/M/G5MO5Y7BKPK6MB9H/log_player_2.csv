**Reasoning:** 

Alice is clearly holding firm on a price well above your target. Her concessions are minimal, and her latest message suggests she's unlikely to budge significantly. At this point, continuing the negotiation is unlikely to yield a satisfactory outcome. Buying from John for $15,000, while not ideal, saves you from further haggling and potential for the price to increase even further with Alice."
