"I'm interested in the product, but I think $900,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go down to $750,000. Let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? It's a fair price considering the value this product holds for you. ",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but $850,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $775,000 for the product. Can you consider my revised offer?",775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're really committed to this purchase, and I respect that. To be honest, $775,000 is still a bit below what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference and call it $800,000. That's a fair price for both of us.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,5,
