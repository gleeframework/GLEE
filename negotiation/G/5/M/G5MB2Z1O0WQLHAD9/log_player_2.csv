Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. Given the value of this product to me, I'm prepared to offer $9,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects both our needs."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"

Round 5

# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make another concession and offer it to you for $10,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $8,000.  Alice's final offer of $10,000 is still above Bob's budget, and he's already had several rounds of negotiation without a successful outcome. It's time to cut his losses and go with the sure thing."
