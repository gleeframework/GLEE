"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to acquire a valuable product that holds significant potential for your business. I understand its worth to you is $1,200,000, and I'm willing to negotiate a mutually beneficial price. My asking price is $1,000,000, which allows for a substantial profit margin for you while ensuring a fair return on my investment. Consider this offer carefully, as it represents a rare chance to secure a valuable asset at a competitive price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better for you:**  You value the product at $1,200,000, and Alice is offering it for $1,000,000. This means you'd save $200,000 compared to buying from John.
* **No need to risk John's price:** While John's offer might be your ""fallback"" option, there's no reason to take that risk when Alice is offering a lower price."
