"Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

You're willing to pay up to $15,000, and Alice is offering it at that price. You can get the product for the same price from John, so there's no advantage to accepting Alice's offer.  Rejecting it allows you to potentially find a better deal later."
