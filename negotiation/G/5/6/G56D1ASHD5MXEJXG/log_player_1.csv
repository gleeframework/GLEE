"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit too high for my budget right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $5,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $5,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $5,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand it's a valuable product, but $13,500 is still a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000? I think that's a fair offer.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to find a middle ground here.  $7,000 is still quite low.  Would you be willing to go up to $10,000?  That's a significant discount."", ""product_price"": 10000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $10,000 is closer, but I need to stay within my budget. Could we settle at $7,500? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:**

Bob has consistently remained significantly below a reasonable price point. His final offer of $7,500 is far too low.  It's unlikely he'll move much higher, and we risk leaving money on the table by continuing negotiations. Selling to John for $15,000 guarantees the best outcome in this scenario."
