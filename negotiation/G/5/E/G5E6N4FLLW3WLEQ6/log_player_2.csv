"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $120 to you, and we're looking to maximize our earnings. Let's start with a fair offer. How about $110? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  While it's within your budget, you want to save as much as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible.**  You have 10 rounds, so there's time to try and get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You'll need to make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $110 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $105, which is still a good price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 105}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-offer is below Alice's offer:** This shows you're serious about negotiating and willing to compromise.
* **Counter-offer is close to Alice's value:** $105 is close to Alice's $100 value, making it more likely she'll accept.
* **Message is polite and conveys your willingness to negotiate:** This maintains a positive tone and encourages a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. To ensure we both achieve a satisfactory outcome, let's consider an offer of $108. This allows us to maintain a reasonable profit while still being competitive. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is close to your counteroffer:** $108 is only $3 more than your $105 counteroffer. 
* **You're saving money:**  You're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $120.
* **Limited rounds:**  With only 10 rounds, accepting this offer avoids the risk of further negotiation and potential deal breakdown.

**Next Steps:**  The deal is closed! You've successfully negotiated a lower price for the product."
