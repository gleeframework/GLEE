"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline. I am unable to reduce the price below $1,200,000 due to the value and exclusivity of the product. I appreciate your interest and hope we can find a mutually beneficial solution in the future.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
