"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. While $9,500 is a better price than John's $10,000, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $8,500.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm genuinely interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget."", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9000?  It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is $9,000.** This is a better price than John's offer of $10,000.
* **Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.**  Accepting this offer achieves that goal while still getting the product he wants.

While Bob could potentially continue negotiating and try to get a lower price, there's no guarantee he'll succeed.  Accepting Alice's offer is the most practical choice to save money and secure the product."
