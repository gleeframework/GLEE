{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

This offer starts high, aiming for the middle ground between your minimum value and Bob's perceived value. This gives Bob room to negotiate while still allowing you to potentially make a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  While it's a good starting point, I'm looking to spend closer to $8500.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm genuinely interested in your product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better price.  Rejecting his offer keeps the negotiation open and gives you the chance to counter with a price closer to your desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your budget. While I'm happy to negotiate, $8,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  It's a fair price that still leaves room for both of us to be happy. "", ""product_price"": 9000}
