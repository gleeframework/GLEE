Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $11,500.  I think this is a fair price considering its potential worth to you."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting a bit high allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially feeling like he got a better deal.
* **Backup Option:**  We have a guaranteed sale at $10,000 to John, so we don't want to go below that. 

By offering the product at $11,500, we leave room for negotiation while still aiming for a significant profit."
