Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a fantastic product that I think you'd really enjoy. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting high:**  I'm starting at $100, which is higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80). This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Positive framing:** I'm highlighting the product's value (""fantastic"", ""enjoy"") to make Bob more interested.
* **Open-ended question:**  Asking ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage and potentially counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider $80 for it? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in risking a lower offer or going through further negotiations. Accepting his offer ensures a quick sale and a guaranteed profit."
