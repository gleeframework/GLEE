{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product to you today for $11,999. I think you'll find it's a great deal for something of this quality."", ""product_price"": 11999}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While Bob's valuation is lower than John's, Alice should aim higher than $10,000 initially.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to pay a bit more than his perceived value, especially if the offer is framed well. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting high allows room for Bob to negotiate. Even if he counters, Alice can still likely settle for a price higher than John's offer.
* **Anchor High:** By starting with a high anchor price, Alice influences Bob's perception of the product's value. This can make a slightly lower counter-offer from Bob more palatable.

**Important Note:**  There's always a risk Bob will reject a high price. However, Alice has a guaranteed fallback with John at $10,000. This strategy balances risk and the potential for higher profit."
