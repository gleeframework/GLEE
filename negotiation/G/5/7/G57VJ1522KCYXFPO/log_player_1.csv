{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly very interested in the product and is willing to negotiate. While $980,000 is less than Alice's ideal price, it's still a significant profit margin above her $800,000 minimum.  

Continuing to push for $1,000,000 risks alienating Bob and might lead to him walking away from the deal entirely. It's better to accept a strong offer now than risk ending up with John's lower offer later."
