"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be incredibly valuable for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is way above your budget. It's a good time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 8000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** We're starting with a significantly lower offer ($8,000) than Alice's initial price. This gives us room to negotiate upward while staying within our $10,000 limit. 
* **Gauge Alice's Flexibility:** This counteroffer helps gauge how flexible Alice is willing to be on the price. 
* **Alternative Option:**  We always have John's offer of $10,000 in our back pocket if negotiations with Alice don't go well."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Above Budget:** While Alice came down in price, $12,000 is still above your $10,000 limit. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** Alice's willingness to move from $15,000 to $12,000 suggests there's room for further negotiation.  

Let's see if we can get Alice closer to our budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? I'm eager to make this work."",
""product_price"": 9500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Increase:** We're increasing our offer to $9,500, showing Alice we are willing to negotiate upwards.
* **Staying Below Limit:**  This offer keeps us safely below our $10,000 maximum while aiming to close the gap. 
* **Expressing Interest:** The message reinforces our interest in the product, encouraging Alice to consider our offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** Alice has stated that $11,000 is her final offer. 
* **Above Budget:** This price is still $1,000 over your budget.
* **Guaranteed Deal:** John offers a guaranteed purchase at $10,000.

Since Alice is unwilling to budge further and her final offer exceeds your budget, it's in your best interest to secure the product from John at your desired price."
