"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is significantly less than what I can accept. Let's meet in the middle â€“ how about $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet in the middle. $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $9,500? I'm eager to make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I can come down a bit further, but $9,500 is still too low for me.  How about we settle at $11,000? That's my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,
