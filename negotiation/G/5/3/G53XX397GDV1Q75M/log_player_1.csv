Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, $15,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'm interested in the product, but I would be willing to pay around $8,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
