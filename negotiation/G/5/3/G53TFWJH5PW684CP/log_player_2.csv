Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $5,000 is definitely too low for me, I'm willing to come down a bit. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? This still gives you a good deal, and it's closer to what I need to make this work.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $7,000 just isn't workable for me. I'm willing to make a final concession and offer the product for $8,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it gets us closer to a deal. I'm not willing to go lower, but I hope we can come to an agreement on this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

At this point, Alice has indicated she won't go lower than $8,500.  You have the option to buy from John for $8,000, which meets your goal of getting the best possible price. There's no need to negotiate further with Alice."
