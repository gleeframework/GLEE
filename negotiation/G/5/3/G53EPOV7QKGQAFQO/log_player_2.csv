"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. It's worth negotiating further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $20,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  To move forward, I can drop to $17,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than her initial proposal, it's still higher than my maximum budget. I want to see if I can push her lower before considering buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the offer, but we're still quite far apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a firm offer, as I'm already making a significant concession. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down some, her offer of $15,500 is still well above my budget. I've already made several counteroffers, and it seems unlikely that she will come down to a price I'm comfortable with. To avoid further negotiation and ensure I get the product within my budget, I'll buy it from John for $8,000."
