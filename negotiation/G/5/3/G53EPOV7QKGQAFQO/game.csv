"Hi Alice,  Thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is well above my budget. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only offer $8,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your initial offer, but $20,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept.  To move forward, I can drop to $17,000. This is a very competitive price considering the value this product offers.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $17,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $10,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I place on the product.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the offer, but we're still quite far apart. To meet you closer to the middle, I'm willing to come down to $15,500. This is a firm offer, as I'm already making a significant concession.",15500.0,Alice,5,
