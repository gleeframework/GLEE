"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. I believe this is a fair deal, and I'm confident you'll be happy with your purchase.

"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree this product would be valuable to me, I'm not comfortable with that price point. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $700,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me a bit closer to my range.  However, to make this deal work, I would need the price to be closer to $750,000.  Would that be possible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're getting closer to the price you're willing to pay. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at $750,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering a counteroffer of $825,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you think?",825000.0,Alice,5,
