"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product. Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000. I believe it's a fair price considering its potential benefits for you.",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $8,000 for it. Let me know what you think.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. While I understand your perspective, $8,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider letting it go for $17,000. This feels like a fair compromise.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving a bit on the price.  However, $17,000 is still more than I'm looking to spend.  Would you be willing to meet somewhere in the middle, perhaps around $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're finding some middle ground.  While $10,000 is still lower than I'd prefer, I'm willing to accept $14,000. This is my final offer, as I do have other potential buyers.",14000.0,Alice,5,
