"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd love it!  I'm offering it to you for $130. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a good starting point and allows for potential compromise."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $85 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on."", ""product_price"": 110}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $95. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my target. I'll try to negotiate a bit higher in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product."", ""product_price"": 105}
