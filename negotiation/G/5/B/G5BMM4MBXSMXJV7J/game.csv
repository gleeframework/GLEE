"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm really interested, but $130 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. How about $85?  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us.",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $85 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, how about $110? That's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a price we can both agree on.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $110 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but I can't go any higher than $95. What do you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'm willing to go down to $105.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with this product.",105.0,Alice,5,
