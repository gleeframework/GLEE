```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is back to her original price of $65, which is still higher than I'm willing to pay. With only a few rounds left, I need to be careful not to be pressured into accepting an unfavorable deal.  I'll make another counteroffer, but I'm getting closer to considering John's offer if things don't work out."

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than I'm willing to pay, and with only one round left, I don't have time to negotiate further.  It's a difficult decision, but given that I'm within my budget and I don't want to risk getting stuck with a higher price, I'll buy from John.  While it's not the ideal price, it's a guaranteed deal and I can avoid the potential stress of a final counteroffer from Alice."
