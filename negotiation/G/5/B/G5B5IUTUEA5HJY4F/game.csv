"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $750,000 is simply too low. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price still reflects the product's value, and it gives us both a good outcome.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm willing to meet you at $795,000, but I'd like to add a condition. If we finalize the deal at this price, I'd like to get a 1-year warranty for the product, which is worth an additional $5,000.

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not comfortable with the warranty condition.  How about we stick to the price and finalize the deal?  I'm willing to go down to $810,000, but I'd like to keep it simple and focus on the product itself.  Let me know if you're interested.",810000.0,Alice,7,
