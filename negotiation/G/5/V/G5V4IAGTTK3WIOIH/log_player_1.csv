``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price that is higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum acceptable price. This allows for room for negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will counter Bob's offer in the next round, aiming for a price closer to my desired range."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $10500 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $9750. Let me know if you're willing to go that far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,750

While Bob's offer of $9,750 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired range. I'll make another counteroffer, aiming to get as close to $10,500 as possible."

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While I can't go as low as $9,750, I'm willing to meet you at $10,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and allows us to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. I'm willing to go up to $9900, which is very close to your offer and hopefully a good compromise for both of us.  Let me know if you're open to that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While $9,900 is close to my last offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. I'm not willing to go any lower and risk losing a significant amount of money. Therefore, I'll sell the product to John for $15,000 to ensure a better outcome for myself."
