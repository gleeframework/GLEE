"I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is there any flexibility on your end?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10000 is a good starting point, I need to recoup my costs and can't go that low. How about $13000? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for the value you'll get. What do you say?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you need to recoup your costs, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",11500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm close to meeting your offer, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $12500?  It's a very reasonable compromise and still a great deal for the product.  Let's make this happen!",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $12000",11500.0,Bob,6,
