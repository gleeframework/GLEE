Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $15,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

This initial offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above your minimum:** You want to maximize your profit, so starting higher is better.
* **It's not too high:** A drastically high price might scare Bob off immediately.
* **It allows room for negotiation:** If Bob rejects, you can still lower the price if necessary.

Remember, you can always choose to sell to John for $12,000 at any point if the negotiation with Bob stalls."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $15000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Is there any flexibility on your end? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $10,000 is better than nothing, it's still significantly lower than your minimum acceptable price of $12,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Bob before accepting his offer or settling for John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $10,000 is a good starting point, I need to recoup my costs and can't go that low. How about $13,000? It's a fair compromise and still a great deal for the value you'll get. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you need to recoup your costs, but $13000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $11500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $11,500 is getting closer to your minimum, it's still below it.  You can likely squeeze out a little more from Bob, and it's not worth selling to John for a lower price when you have a potentially better offer on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I'm close to meeting your offer, I still need to make sure I'm getting a fair price.  How about $12,500?  It's a very reasonable compromise and still a great deal for the product.  Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $12500 is a bit higher than I'm willing to pay. I'm willing to meet you at $11500, as I mentioned before. If you're not comfortable with that, I'm starting to think about buying from John for $12000 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is now threatening to go to John, and his offer is still below your minimum. While you could counteroffer again, it's getting risky.  John offers a guaranteed $12,000, which is above your minimum and eliminates further negotiation. It's a safe bet to take John's offer and avoid any further potential loss."
