"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,100,000 for the product. It's a fair price that reflects its value to me and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,100,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to compromise a bit. How about $1,250,000? This price still reflects the product's value and allows for a profitable deal for both of us. Let's work towards a solution that benefits us both.",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,250,000 is closer to what I'm looking for, I'm still a bit hesitant. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000 for the product. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's work together to finalize this agreement.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. While I value our discussion, $1,150,000 is still a bit too low for me.  To finalize this deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,200,000. This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and ensures a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's finalize this transaction and move forward.",1200000.0,Alice,5,
