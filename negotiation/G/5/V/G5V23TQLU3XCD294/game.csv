,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $2000000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm interested in the product but would need to come in lower. Would you be willing to consider $1700000?",1700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $1700000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1850000, but that's my final offer. Let me know if you're interested.",1850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1850000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1775000. This is a fair price considering the value we've both discussed.  Let me know if this works for you.",1775000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  While $1775000 is closer, I'm still not quite there. How about we split the difference and settle on $1812500? This is a fair price that reflects the product's value and allows us to reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",1812500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1812500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm prepared to go up to $1790000. This is a fair price considering the value we've discussed and would allow us to finalize this deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",1790000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand your position, but $1790000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to make one final concession and meet you at $1800000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know if you agree.",1800000.0,Alice,7,
