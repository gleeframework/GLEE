"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product for sale. I think you'll find it's a great opportunity. I'm willing to sell it to you for $10000. Would you like to make an offer or accept the price? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is at your maximum price, there's no reason to immediately accept.  By rejecting, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice. There's always a chance she's willing to go lower, and you might be able to save some money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to consider $8,000? I'm very interested in the product, and I think we can find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8000}
