Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me right now. I'm thinking something closer to $800,000 would make sense. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000.

We are getting closer to my minimum, but I still think I can push for a better deal with Bob. It's too early to settle for $1,350,000 when I have John as backup."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, your offer is very tempting, and I appreciate you working with me on this. However, to make this work on my end, I need to be at $1,475,000. I believe this reflects the true value of the product while acknowledging your investment. What do you say?"",

While it's less than John's offer, Bob has signaled this is his final offer. Accepting $1,400,000 is a good outcome, netting a significant profit over Bob's initial offer and avoiding the risk of pushing him away entirely."
