Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly. I believe it's a great deal at $11,500.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 11500
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to $12,000 as possible.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Knowing Bob values it at $8,000, Alice needs to offer a price that's appealing but leaves room for profit.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  John guarantees Alice $12,000, so there's no need to go below that.
* **Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves room for potential negotiation (if Bob counter-offers) while staying close to Alice's desired price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, Alice can choose to negotiate or stick with her guaranteed sale to John."
