"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand you think $1,050,000 is a fair price, but I'm afraid I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get at least $1,300,000 for the product. How about we compromise at $1,250,000?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway. How about we split the difference between our last offers and land at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you at $1,200,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. I'm confident this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,5,
