"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this incredible product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $10,000, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $10,000 because I know the product is worth at least $8,000 to me. This gives me room to negotiate down if needed.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  By saying I'm open to negotiation, I signal that I'm flexible and willing to find a solution that works for both of us.
* **Asking for Thoughts:**  I'm encouraging Bob to share his thoughts on the price, which will help me gauge his interest and potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $10000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $8000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Potential for More:** While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, there's still a chance to get closer to my desired price.  I can try to negotiate a higher price.
* **Testing the Waters:**  By rejecting Bob's offer, I can see if he's truly serious about buying the product or if he's just trying to get a low price. 
* **Staying Flexible:** It's important to keep the option of selling to John open, but I'm not ready to give up on a potentially better deal with Bob just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  While $8,000 is a good price, I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price.  How about $9,000?  It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find the product worth it."", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm meeting Bob halfway, offering a price that's closer to his offer but still higher than my minimum. 
* **Value Proposition:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's worth to justify my price.
* **Open to Discussion:**  I'm keeping the conversation open to potential further negotiation if Bob isn't satisfied."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'd be willing to meet you halfway, but I think I can do better than $9000. How about $8500? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:** Bob's offer is only $500 less than my desired price.  This is a significant step closer to my goal.
* **Limited Rounds:** We're already in round 4, and with each round, the chance of closing a deal decreases. 
* **Risk vs. Reward:** There's a good chance that if I reject Bob's offer, he might walk away or continue to lower his price.  Accepting this offer guarantees a sale at a price that's within my acceptable range. 

**It's important to note:** While I'm accepting the offer now,  it's still worth remembering that John is a backup option if the negotiations with Bob completely fall apart."
