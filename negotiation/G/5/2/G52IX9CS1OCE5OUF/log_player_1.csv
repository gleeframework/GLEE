Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the product for $14,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think."", 
""product_price"": 14500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much as possible from Bob while ensuring he's likely to accept. 
* **Above Bob's Valuation:** Offering it at or below $12,000 leaves money on the table. 
* **Below John's Offer:**  John's guaranteed $15,000 offer sets a baseline.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly below John's offer allows room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further.

This strategy aims for a price that's appealing to Bob (saving him $500 compared to John's offer) while still securing a significant profit for Alice."
