"Bob, I have a product that I believe is of significant value to you. I'm offering it to you for $1400000. This price reflects its worth and allows for a profitable margin for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe this price is more in line with the value I would place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1200000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product for you. It would benefit both of us to be more realistic about the price. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to see a price closer to my initial offer. How about $1300000? This price allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a middle ground.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $1300000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. How about $1250000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1250000 still falls short of the product's true value for you.  Let's aim for a deal that benefits both of us.  I'm willing to go down to $1350000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential for you.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1350000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again. How about $1275000? I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1275000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're very close to a deal.  I understand your budget concerns, but $1275000 doesn't quite capture the product's full potential for you. Let's make a final compromise. I'm willing to drop to $1325000.  This price is fair, and it allows us to finalize this deal.  What do you say?",1325000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1325000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to make one more offer. How about $1290000? I think this is a fair price that balances the value of the product with my budget.",1290000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is our final offer.  I've made a lot of concessions to meet your budget, and I'm now at my limit. I'm offering the product for $1300000. This is the best price I can offer, considering the potential value this product holds for you.  It's a fair price, and I believe it's in our best interest to close the deal now.  What's your final answer?",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, but I've already gone as low as I can. I'm willing to make one last attempt to find a mutually beneficial price. How about $1280000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product to me, and I'm willing to compromise to get the deal done.",1280000.0,Bob,10,
