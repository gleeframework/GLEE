Send your offer to Bob.","```json

I'm starting with a high price of $2,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully maximizes my profit. I'll be keeping a close eye on Bob's response and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers. If he seems hesitant, I might lower my price in subsequent rounds, but I'll try to hold out for as much as I can."
