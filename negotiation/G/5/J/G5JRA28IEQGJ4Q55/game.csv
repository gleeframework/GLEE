"I'm excited to offer you the product at a price of $15,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $8,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.",15000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $15,000 is way outside my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can't go higher than $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,500 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'm offering the product to you for $13,000. This is a fair price considering the value you place on the product and the initial offer I made.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $13,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $10,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to make one more concession, and I'm offering the product to you for $12,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,5,
