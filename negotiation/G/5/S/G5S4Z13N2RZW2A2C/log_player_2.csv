"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you an exclusive deal on this amazing product, but I need to make a profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

This is the best option. Here's why:

* **Saves money:** $140 is less than your $150 maximum and cheaper than buying from John.
* **Secures the product:** Accepting the offer guarantees you get the product."
