"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below my asking price and still gives you a significant profit margin. Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,000,000 is a bit too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $700,000? It's a fair price that allows me a decent profit margin.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but  $900,000 is my absolute minimum.  This still gives you a substantial profit margin, and it's a fair compromise. What do you say?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand that you're looking for a fair price. How about we settle at $750,000? It's a significant step closer to your price, and it allows me a reasonable profit margin.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. Let's reach a deal now, as I'm running out of time for this negotiation.",850000.0,Alice,5,
