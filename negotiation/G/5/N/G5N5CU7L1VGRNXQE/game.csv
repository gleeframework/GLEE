"Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I think it's well worth the price. What do you think?",175.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product, $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it. What do you think?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $120 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $150, which is still a good deal considering its value. What do you say?",150.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $150 is still above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $135. Let's meet in the middle.",135.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're willing to negotiate.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $142.50?  It's a fair price for both of us.",142.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $142.50 is still too high for me. I can offer you $138. This is a fair compromise, and it allows me to stay within my budget. What do you say?",138.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $138 is still a bit low for me.  How about $140? It's just a small step up from your offer and would be a fair compromise.",140.0,Alice,7,
