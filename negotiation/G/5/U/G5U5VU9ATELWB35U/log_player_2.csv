**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  Alice is selling for $1,200,000, while John wants $1,500,000.
* **You can save money:**  Accepting Alice's offer saves you $300,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though the product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, that's irrelevant to your decision.  You're focused on getting the best price for yourself."
