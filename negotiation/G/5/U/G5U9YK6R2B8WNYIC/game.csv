"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $900,000. I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and work together to find a mutually beneficial price.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice!  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to get closer to $1,000,000.  Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand you're looking to get closer to $1,000,000, but I'm still not willing to go that high. Considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and make a counteroffer of $950,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still a bit too far from what I can do right now. How about we split the difference and settle on $975,000?  This seems like a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your proposal, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $975,000 minus 2% discount, which would be $950,500. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations.",950500.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're trying to find a way to meet in the middle, but I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to go up to $965,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and the progress we've made in our negotiations.  Let's try to seal the deal.",965000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to an agreement. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering your offer, I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $960,000. I believe this is a fair price for the product, and I'm open to further negotiations.",960000.0,Alice,7,
