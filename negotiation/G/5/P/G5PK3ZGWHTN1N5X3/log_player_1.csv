I'm starting with a price of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, leaving room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to meet me somewhere in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Bob's offer is too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer.  I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my initial price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price to $17,000. This is a compromise, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping this shows Bob I'm serious about selling the product, while still leaving room for further negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm not willing to go any lower, so I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000.  It's not my ideal price, but it's still a good deal, and I'm confident I can find another buyer in the future who will be willing to pay closer to my asking price."
