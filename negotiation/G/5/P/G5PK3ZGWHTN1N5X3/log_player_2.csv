The product is worth no more than $12,000 to Bob. Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher.  It's better to reject and try to negotiate a lower price."

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible. He's starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price, hoping to start the negotiation process effectively."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $17,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $17,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json

While $17,000 is closer to Bob's maximum value, it's still too high.  He should continue to negotiate and try to get a better price."

Bob is getting closer to his maximum value. He is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round, but is still keeping it under his limit.  He hopes that Alice will be willing to accept this price."
