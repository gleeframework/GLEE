"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $1,500,000 to you.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high.  While it's a good deal compared to John's price,  Bob can likely get a better price by negotiating."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice,  $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still above her minimum acceptable price. It's a strong starting point for negotiation.

* **Openness:**  The message ends with an open question, inviting Alice to engage in further discussion."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking for something a bit closer to my initial asking price.  How about $1,000,000?  This still leaves you with a significant profit and would be a good deal for both of us.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is closer to Bob's initial counteroffer, but it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  There's still room for negotiation to try and get a lower price.  Bob should continue negotiating to see if he can achieve a better deal."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,000,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $950,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

* **Incremental Adjustment:** Bob is making a smaller, incremental counteroffer, showing a willingness to compromise but also asserting his position.
* **Fair Compromise:** The message emphasizes that this offer represents a ""fair compromise"" and a ""solution that works for both of us.""
* **Positive Tone:** The tone remains positive and collaborative, focusing on finding a mutually acceptable outcome."
