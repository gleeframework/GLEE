"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to own this unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations. What are your thoughts?"", 
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We're aiming high to establish a strong negotiating position. This leaves room for concessions while staying well above our minimum acceptable price.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" without revealing specifics that Bob could use against us.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is collaborative, inviting Bob's input and suggesting this is just the first step in finding a mutually agreeable price. 

By starting high, we gather information about Bob's willingness to pay and set the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the opportunity to purchase the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,800,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price, considering the product's value and potential. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is substantial, it's still significantly below our initial asking price and leaves a considerable amount of potential profit on the table. We are early in the negotiation process, and  we have room to negotiate further. Bob's willingness to engage in a counteroffer suggests he's serious about purchasing the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. It's clear we both see the value in this product. To bridge the gap, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, and I believe it's a fair and attractive offer."", 
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a substantial concession of $250,000 to signal flexibility and willingness to negotiate. However, we're still well above both Bob's valuation and our guaranteed offer from John.
* **Finding Middle Ground:** This offer moves closer to Bob's price range while still aiming for a price significantly above his initial counteroffer. 
* **Positive Framing:** The message highlights the concession and positions the new price as fair and attractive, encouraging Bob to see it favorably. 

Our goal is to find a balance between maximizing profit and keeping Bob engaged in the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,900,000. This is the highest I'm willing to go, and I hope we can agree on a price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly anchored at a price point around $1,900,000. However, we still have some negotiating power. It's worth seeing if we can push him slightly higher before considering accepting or going with John.  We're getting close to a decision point, but another round of negotiation is justified."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a price that works for both of us. I've considered your latest offer carefully, and I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,950,000. This is my final offer, as I believe it represents a fair deal given the value this product brings. "", 
""product_price"": 1950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:** This signals to Bob that we're serious about closing the deal but not willing to go much lower.  
* **Small Concession:**  We're only dropping $50,000, making it clear this is our bottom line.
* **Emphasis on Fairness:**  We reiterate the product's value to justify the price and encourage Bob to accept.

We're at a critical point. Bob's response will likely determine whether we close a deal with him or go with John's guaranteed offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,950,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you at $1,800,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and what I've seen in the market. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now offered $1,800,000 twice, indicating this is likely his ceiling. We've been firm with our final offer of $1,950,000. Further negotiation is unlikely to significantly bridge this gap. 

While $1,800,000 is a good offer, John's guaranteed $1,500,000 provides certainty and avoids the risk of a stalemate with Bob. It's time to take the guaranteed profit and move forward."
