"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 200}
```

I'm starting with a price of $200, which is significantly higher than my minimum.  This is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I'll adjust my strategy based on his response."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is way too low. It's far below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not going to sell the product for that price. I will reject his offer and proceed to the next round with a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 175}
```

I'm going to counter with $175. This is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still gives him some room to negotiate. I want to see if he's willing to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob has increased his offer, it's still too low for me. I'm not going to accept an offer that's significantly lower than my minimum. I will reject his offer and continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 160}
```

I'm going to drop my price a bit to $160. This shows some flexibility and hopefully encourages Bob to come closer to my desired price.  I'm still above my minimum and willing to negotiate further, but I want to see if Bob is serious about a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum acceptable price. I am not going to sell the product for that price. I will reject his offer and continue to negotiate, hoping he will increase his offer further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 155}
```

I'm going to lower my price to $155. This is the lowest I'm willing to go while still being above my minimum. I want to see if Bob will finally meet me halfway, as time is running out. If he rejects this, I'm seriously considering selling to John for $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum, and with only two rounds left, it's unlikely he'll increase his offer significantly.  I'm going to sell to John for $150 to guarantee a sale and avoid potentially losing money by continuing to negotiate with Bob."
