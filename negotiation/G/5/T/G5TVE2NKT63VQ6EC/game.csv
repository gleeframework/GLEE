"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase a unique product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate the offer but $1,400,000 is a bit outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product.  It's a fair price considering its value to me. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1250000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm now offering it to you for $1,350,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I think it's a great compromise.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need a fair price, and I'm willing to go up slightly.  However, $1,350,000 is still a stretch for me. I'm confident we can find a middle ground.  How about $1,300,000? This would be a good compromise for both of us.",1300000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I still need to make a profit on this sale. I'm willing to meet you at $1,325,000, but I need you to meet me halfway from your last offer. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us.",1325000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your commitment to reaching a deal, and I'm willing to go a little higher.  However, $1,325,000 is still outside my budget.  I can offer $1,275,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and closer to your price point.  Let's try to find common ground here.",1275000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued effort to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you at $1,300,000, but I need to make a profit, and I think this is the lowest I can go. I'm willing to make a small concession to get the deal done, but I need you to meet me at this price. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can seal the deal.",1300000.0,Alice,7,
