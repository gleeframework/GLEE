"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900000 doesn't quite cover my costs.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1050000. This gives you a significant saving over the initial price while ensuring I can still get a fair deal. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer. How about $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I'm  open to finding common ground.  $950000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  Let's split the difference. I'll go down to $1000000. This gives us both a good deal.  I'm confident this product will be a real asset to your business, and I want to make sure we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob,  I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $975000 isn't quite enough.  I'm willing to come down to $990000 as a final compromise. This is a very good price for the value of this product, and it's  the closest I can go. Let's close this deal.",990000.0,Alice,7,
