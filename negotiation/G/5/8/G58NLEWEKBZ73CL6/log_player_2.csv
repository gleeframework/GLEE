"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price.  My starting offer is $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still above my maximum budget. I want to see if I can negotiate a lower price before resorting to John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,050,000 for the product.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $1,050,000 is closer, it's still a bit below what I need.  I'm willing to come down to $1,075,000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can close this. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,075,000 is within my budget and closer to my ideal price.  Accepting this offer saves me $25,000 compared to buying from John.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a good chance of reaching a stalemate, and I risk losing the deal entirely.  It's best to take this reasonable offer."
