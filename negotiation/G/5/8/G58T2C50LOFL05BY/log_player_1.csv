Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $14,500. I believe it will be very beneficial for you, but I also have another interested buyer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 14500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $15,000,  it's worth trying to get a higher price from Bob first. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $14,500 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. It's also significantly higher than his perceived value, giving you bargaining power.
* **Time Pressure:** Mentioning another buyer creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a quicker decision. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you are comfortable potentially losing the sale to Bob if he finds the price too high. You are prioritizing maximizing potential profit over guaranteeing the $15,000 sale."
