"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $100 from John. There's no reason to accept Alice's offer at $90. It's better to try to negotiate a lower price with Alice first."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $80, and I'm willing to pay up to $100.  Offering $85 is a fair starting point, leaving room for negotiation while still getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still higher than my maximum willingness to pay ($100 from John). I'll continue to negotiate with Alice, hoping to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 87}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $92 is still too high. I'm going to increase my offer slightly to $87, trying to find a middle ground. This shows I'm willing to negotiate while still staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still too high for me.  Since I'm in round 5,  I have limited time left to negotiate.  It's better to accept John's offer of $100 and get the product rather than risk losing the opportunity to buy it at all."
