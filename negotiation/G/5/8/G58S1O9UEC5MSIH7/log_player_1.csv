Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $140. It's in excellent condition and a great value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 140}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $140, which is above my minimum of $120 but still leaves some room for negotiation. This allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially get a good price in the first round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to pay a premium for a great product like this, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json

Bob's offer of $100 is below my minimum acceptable price of $120.  I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $100 is significantly lower than what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference and go with $110? This gives you a good price and allows me to cover my costs. "", ""product_price"": 110}
```"

Round 4

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating. $105 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet in the middle.  How about $112?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I've had several rounds of negotiation with Bob, and while he is showing interest, he's unwilling to meet my minimum acceptable price.  With only 2 rounds remaining, it's unlikely we'll reach an agreement.  It's time to move on and sell the product to John for $120 to guarantee a sale that meets my minimum price."
