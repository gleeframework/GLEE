Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to get a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering its value to you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,400,000 is significantly below what I can accept. This product holds immense value, and I believe its true worth is closer to my initial offer. To move things along, I'm willing to come down to $1,950,000. This is a substantial concession on my part, reflecting my desire to reach a mutually beneficial agreement."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $1,950,000, but I still think that's a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer. While moving closer to Bob's valuation, we're aiming for a price point that maximizes profit."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. I acknowledge your perspective on the product's value. To demonstrate my commitment to closing this deal, I'm prepared to offer it to you for $1,875,000. This represents a significant compromise on my initial asking price and reflects my desire to find a mutually agreeable solution."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,750,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and the negotiations so far. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While we're still above John's offer, the difference is no longer as significant. Accepting Bob's offer at $1,750,000 secures a considerable profit ($750,000 more than Bob values it) and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially pushing us closer to John's offer or running out of rounds."
