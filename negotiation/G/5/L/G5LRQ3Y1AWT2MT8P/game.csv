"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $100 is my minimum, I'm hoping to get a little closer to my initial asking price.  Would you consider $125? That would still be a good deal for both of us.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit.  $125 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and go with $112.50? ",112.5,Bob,4,
