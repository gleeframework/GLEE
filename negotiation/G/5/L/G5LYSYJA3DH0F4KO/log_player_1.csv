Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in it.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $975,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and it's the highest I can reasonably afford. I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is showing a willingness to negotiate, his offer increments are getting smaller. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer beyond $950,000.  Selling to John for $1,200,000 is the best way to ensure receiving the full value of the product.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks a lower final sale price or a stalemate."
