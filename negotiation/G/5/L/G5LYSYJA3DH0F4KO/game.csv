"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for this product.  It's a fair price considering my budget and the potential value I see in it.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value of this product significantly exceeds your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a firm offer, reflecting a substantial reduction on my part and a fair deal for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate you meeting me halfway, $1,025,000 is still above what I can afford. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for this product, which reflects a significant investment on my end. I believe it's a fair compromise and a good starting point for a deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, the $900,000 offer doesn't reflect the true value of this product. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my end and represents the lowest price I'm willing to accept.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but $975,000 is still out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $950,000. This shows my genuine interest in acquiring this product, and it's the highest I can reasonably afford. I hope we can reach an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,6,
