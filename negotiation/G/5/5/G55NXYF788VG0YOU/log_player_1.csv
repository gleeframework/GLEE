Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a reasonable starting point, as it is higher than my minimum value for the product, but it leaves room for negotiation.  I'll see if Bob is interested at this price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $95 is better than nothing, it is below my minimum value for the product. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm going to counter with $125. This is a compromise, as it is lower than my initial offer, but it is still above my minimum value for the product and hopefully will be acceptable to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum value, but I don't see any reason to continue negotiating.  John is also offering me $100, so I'm going to sell to John. There's no need to risk further negotiation for a potentially lower offer."
