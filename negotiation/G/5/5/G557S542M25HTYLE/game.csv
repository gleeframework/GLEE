"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a unique opportunity to get your hands on something truly remarkable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1200000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and potential benefits. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you see in the product. However, my budget allows me to spend up to $800000 on this purchase. Would you be willing to consider a price closer to that amount?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking to stay within your budget, but I'm afraid $800000 is a bit too low for me to consider. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. While $1000000 is still above my budget, I would like to propose an offer of $900000. This would allow us to close the gap and reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $950000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to make a deal, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $975000. This is my final offer, and I'm not willing to go any lower. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options. What do you think?",975000.0,Alice,7,
