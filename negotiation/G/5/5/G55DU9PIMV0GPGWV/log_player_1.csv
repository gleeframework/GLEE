Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to start high, at my minimum acceptable price. This is because:

* **John is a guaranteed buyer:**  Having John as a backup means I don't have to settle for less than my minimum.
* **Negotiation leverage:**  Starting high allows for potential negotiation room, as Bob might be willing to pay a little more than he initially thought to secure the product."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to sell at $12,000, I'm willing to negotiate a little further. I still have the option to sell to John, so I don't need to rush into a deal at $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

I'm going to counter with $11,500. This is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum. It shows I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm also not giving away too much."

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

I'm going to sell the product to John.  Bob has made it clear he's not willing to go above $10,000, which is too low for me. With John, I'm guaranteed my minimum asking price of $12,000, so it's the better option."
