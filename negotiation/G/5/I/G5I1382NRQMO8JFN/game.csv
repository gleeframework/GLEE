"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth to you is $15,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering the product to you for $11,500. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,750?  That seems like a fair compromise.",10750.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $10,750 is still a bit above your target price, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm offering the product to you for $11,250. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,
