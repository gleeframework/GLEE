Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, and I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13250. This is a fair price considering its value to me and the effort I'm putting into this negotiation. I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your desired price, but $13,250 is still above your ideal.  There are still rounds left and you can potentially negotiate a lower price.  Keep in mind that you are still within your budget and can afford to be patient."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your continued willingness to negotiate. While $13,250 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a price of $13,000. This is a fair offer considering your value, and it's my final price. I believe we can reach an agreement here."", ""product_price"": 13000}

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm getting close to my minimum price, and I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13150. This is as low as I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering its value to me. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly reaching her limit, and her offer of $13,150 is very close to your desired price of $13,000. It's better to accept this offer, as you have a good chance of getting a lower price from John (who is willing to sell for $15,000). You are only $150 away from your ideal price, which is a good outcome.

**Important Note:** This decision balances the risk of further negotiation with the potential benefits of accepting a near-ideal price.  It's possible to reject and make another counteroffer, but the chance of Alice accepting is lower."
