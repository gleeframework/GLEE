**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.** You can get the product for less from John. 
* **Rejecting allows you to counteroffer.**  You can try to negotiate a lower price with Alice, potentially getting a better deal than John's offer."

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high.**  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point.
* **Rejecting allows for continued negotiation.** By rejecting Alice's offer, you can continue to counteroffer and potentially reach a price closer to your target. 
* **John's price is still a backup option.** You can always go with John if you can't reach a better price with Alice."
