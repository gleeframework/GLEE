"Alice, your initial offer is a bit out of my range.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your perspective, but the value of this product is significantly higher than your current offer. I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects the true worth of what's being offered.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product.",950000.0,Bob,4,
