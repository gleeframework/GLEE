"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product.  It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you.  My initial offer is $950,000. Let's discuss further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, it's still higher than what the product is worth to you. You have room to negotiate and potentially save a significant amount of money.  It's worth exploring counteroffers before settling."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is very interesting, but I'm not quite ready to commit to your price.  I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's initial price. This establishes that you are serious about getting a better deal.
* **Reasoning:**  The message highlights the product's value but emphasizes a need for a more favorable price. 
* **Fairness:**  The offer is above Alice's minimum but still allows for further negotiation.

This counteroffer provides a strong starting point for further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down slightly, but let's aim for something closer to the middle ground. I'm proposing $900,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the significant value this product will bring to your business. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but $900,000 is still higher than what you're willing to pay. It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if you can get the price lower. You have room to counteroffer and potentially save a significant amount of money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a more agreeable price. How about $875,000? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** The offer is closer to Alice's last offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Strong Argument:**  The message frames the offer as a ""good compromise,"" implying a fair deal for both parties.
* **Room for Negotiation:**  There's still room to negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer. 

This counteroffer continues to push for a lower price while demonstrating a genuine desire to reach an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $875,000 isn't quite there yet for me. Let's split the difference. I'm offering $887,500. This is a fair price that acknowledges your needs while also allowing me to realize a good return on my investment. I'm confident this is a win-win for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down significantly from her initial offer, and $887,500 is close to your target price.  While you could potentially push for a lower price, the risk of losing the deal to John (at $1,000,000) is too high.  It's a good deal for you, and it's worth securing the product now."
