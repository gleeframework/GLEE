Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  The product is very interesting, but I'm not quite ready to commit to your price.  I'd like to offer $850,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us. What are your thoughts?

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $900,000 is getting closer, but I'm still hoping to find a more agreeable price. How about $875,000? It's a good compromise, and it allows us both to make a worthwhile deal. What do you think?
