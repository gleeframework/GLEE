"I understand that you're trying to find a fair price, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the $1,375,000. I'd be willing to meet you halfway at $1,325,000. I think that's a more reasonable price for the product, considering its value to me.",1325000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your perspective, and I'm happy to continue working towards a fair deal. While $1,325,000 is a step closer, it's still a bit low considering the significant value this product holds for you. I'm willing to compromise further and offer it for $1,350,000. This reflects the product's worth and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
