"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe it's worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $800,000. This gives us room to negotiate and allows me to maximize my profit.  I'm aiming for a compromise that's beneficial for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because I believe I can still get a better price. While $900,000 is a good offer, it's still lower than my minimum goal of $1,000,000. I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still looking for a higher price. How about $1,100,000? It's a fair price considering the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm still aiming for a price above my minimum goal, but I've lowered my initial offer to show I'm willing to negotiate. $1,100,000 is a compromise that's closer to Bob's offer, but still gives me a good profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that you're looking for a higher price, but I'm still not willing to go above $950,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $975,000 is getting closer to my minimum goal, I'm still hesitant to accept. I believe I can secure a price closer to $1,000,000. I'm going to counteroffer again in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $975,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $1,050,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I hope you'll find it acceptable."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

I'm slowly bringing the price down, but I'm still aiming for a price that's close to my minimum goal. I'm hoping that by making a compromise and emphasizing my willingness to negotiate, Bob will be more open to meeting me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you consider my revised offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm choosing to sell to John for $1,000,000. While Bob's offer of $1,025,000 is close to my minimum goal, it's still not high enough to justify continuing negotiations. Selling to John guarantees me a secure and satisfactory outcome."
