"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $145. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $145. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $145
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $145 is within your budget, you can get the product for $150 from John. Rejecting Alice's offer might lead her to propose a lower price, potentially saving you even more money."
