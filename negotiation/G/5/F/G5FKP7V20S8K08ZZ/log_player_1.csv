Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $89 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $87 and $89, which would be $88. Can you accept that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $88

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a good deal and I'm running out of rounds. It's better to get $88 than to risk getting stuck with a lower price or having to sell to John for $80."
