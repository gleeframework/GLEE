"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's higher than Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Reasonable Margin:** The price is still significantly lower than my minimum desired value, indicating a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:** The message emphasizes the value of the product and the potential benefit for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Unacceptable:** $600,000 is far below my minimum acceptable value of $1,500,000. Accepting this would result in a huge financial loss.
* **Negotiation is Still Possible:**  While Bob's offer is low, I believe there's room for negotiation to reach a mutually acceptable price.
* **Exploring Options:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially reach a higher price, or  consider selling to John if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offering:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but showing a willingness to negotiate further.
* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my initial offer. This signals flexibility and encourages further discussion.
* **Maintaining Value:** $900,000 is still well above my minimum acceptable price, ensuring I don't lose too much.
* **Focus on Benefits:** The message emphasizes the potential benefits for both parties, highlighting the opportunity for a win-win scenario."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:**  While Bob's offer is a significant increase from the previous round, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  Accepting it would mean a substantial loss. 
* **Potential for Improvement:** There is still potential for further negotiation. I can continue to counteroffer and try to reach a price closer to my desired value.
* **John as a Safety Net:** The option to sell to John for $1,500,000 provides me with a safety net if the negotiation with Bob fails. This gives me leverage in the negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to compromise, $750,000 is still too far below my desired value.  Let's try $850,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Gradual Increase:**  I'm increasing my offer slightly, demonstrating flexibility, but staying above my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Focus on Compromise:** I emphasize the compromise I'm making and the benefits of reaching a deal. 
* **Win-Win Mentality:** I reiterate the idea of a ""win-win"" scenario, encouraging Bob to see the potential for both parties to gain. 
* **Testing the Waters:** This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's seriousness and potentially find a middle ground."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000. I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $775,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $775,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Too Low:** While Bob's offer is closer, it's still significantly lower than my minimum desired value of $1,500,000. 
* **Potential for Improvement:**  I believe there is still room for further negotiation, especially considering I have John as a backup buyer.
* **Time is Running Out:** While the rounds are running out, I still have enough time to continue negotiating and potentially reach a more favorable price.

By rejecting this offer, I can send a counteroffer and attempt to push the price closer to my desired value.  If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John and secure a significantly higher price."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, we're still quite far apart. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and bring the price down to $825,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 825000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:** I'm signaling that this is my last counteroffer, creating urgency for Bob to accept. 
* **Compromise and Value:**  I'm making a significant concession by coming down from $850,000, while still maintaining a price above my minimum acceptable value.
* **Emphasis on Mutual Benefit:** The message focuses on a win-win scenario and encourages Bob to see the benefits of closing the deal.
* **Time is Limited:**  With only 3 rounds left, I need to make a move that encourages Bob to accept to avoid needing to sell to John."
