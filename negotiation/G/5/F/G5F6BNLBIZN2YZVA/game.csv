"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great opportunity to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for your offer. I'm interested, but $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $750,000? That's a fair deal for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to compromise, $750,000 is still too far below my desired value.  Let's try $850,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. What do you think?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm willing to increase my offer slightly to $775,000. I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",775000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, we're still quite far apart. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and bring the price down to $825,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",825000.0,Alice,7,
