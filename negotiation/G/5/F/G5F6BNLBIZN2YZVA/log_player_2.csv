"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $600,000 is far below what this product is worth. I'm willing to come down to $900,000, which still leaves room for both of us to benefit from this deal. Let's find common ground.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While I'm willing to compromise, $750,000 is still too far below my desired value.  Let's try $850,000. This represents a significant concession on my part, and it would allow both of us to walk away with a satisfactory outcome. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $775,000 is closer, we're still quite far apart. I'm prepared to offer a final concession and bring the price down to $825,000. This is my best offer, and I believe it allows for a mutually beneficial outcome. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

At this point, Alice has come down significantly, but she's unlikely to go below $825,000.  You can get the product for $800,000 from John, so it's more beneficial to take that deal."
