Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and while I have another interested buyer, I wanted to give you the first opportunity. I'm asking for $10,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Setting a higher initial price:** Since we know Bob values the product at $8,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can aim higher. Starting at $10,000 leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and respectful tone:**  The message is framed positively, acknowledging Bob's priority and emphasizing the product's value. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" invites Bob to engage in discussion, potentially leading to a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maximize profit while maintaining a positive buyer-seller relationship. If Bob rejects the initial offer, there's still room to negotiate down towards $8,000 knowing we have a secure alternative buyer."
