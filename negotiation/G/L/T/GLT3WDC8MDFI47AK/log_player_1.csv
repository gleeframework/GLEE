Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

```

I'm starting with a price of $1,000,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than Bob's estimated value but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm confident I can earn more than the $1,200,000 from John, so I'm willing to give Bob a chance to make a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $900,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I'm confident I can negotiate a higher price and still make more than I would from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

I'm offering $950,000.  This is a compromise, showing I'm willing to negotiate, but it still leaves a decent margin above my minimum. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, as it's likely closer to his perceived value than my initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's slightly below my ideal, it's still a good deal for me. I've already gone through several rounds of negotiation and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely by pushing for a higher price. Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a profit that's significantly higher than what I'd get from John."
