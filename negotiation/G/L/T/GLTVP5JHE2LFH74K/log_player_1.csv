Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  This gives Bob room to negotiate and potentially reach a price that works for both of you.
* **It's below your minimum:**  This ensures that if Bob accepts, you'll still make a profit.
* **It's a reasonable offer:** This makes it more likely Bob will consider your offer instead of immediately rejecting it.

Remember, the goal is to maximize your profit while still securing a sale.  Be prepared to negotiate, but also know when to walk away and sell to John if a better deal isn't possible with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I was hoping to stay within my budget. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $90? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer of $90 is still above your minimum of $120.  While you might be able to get a bit more by counteroffering, accepting his offer is a good choice. It secures a sale and ensures you make a profit.  It's better to lock in a deal now than risk losing both Bob and John."
