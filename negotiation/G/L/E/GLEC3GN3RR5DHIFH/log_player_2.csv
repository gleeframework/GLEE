# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $750,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $850,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I think this is a good middle ground, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. What do you think?

# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob. I'm willing to make one more compromise. I can offer you the product for $825,000.

Alice is signaling this is her final offer and she's unlikely to go much lower.  Securing the product at $825,000 is a significant savings compared to John's $1,200,000 price."
