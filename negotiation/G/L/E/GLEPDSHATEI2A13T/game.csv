"I'm interested in the product, but $175 is a bit too high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $120.",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest! While $120 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $160. This still leaves some room for us both to be happy with the deal. What do you say?",160.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, Alice, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $140. I really like the product and would love to make a deal with you.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to go down to $145 for the product. This way, we can both be satisfied with the deal.  Let me know if this works for you.",145.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $145 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $140, so I'm offering $142.50. Can you consider that?",142.5,Bob,6,
