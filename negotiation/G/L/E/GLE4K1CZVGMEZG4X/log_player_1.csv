Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am not able to pay $2000000 for it. I would like to propose a price closer to my budget, which is $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting, $800,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my desired price through further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800,000 is simply too low. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward."", ""product_price"": 1700000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $1700000 is still beyond my current capacity. I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000

$1,000,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to counter Bob again, hoping to get closer to my desired price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1,000,000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1,600,000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range and allows us to move forward with the transaction.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

$1,200,000 is still too low for me. I'm going to counter Bob's offer again. Even though I have the option to sell to John, I believe I can get a better price from Bob with a few more rounds of negotiation."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $1,200,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,400,000.

It's a tough decision, but I'm going to sell to John.  While Bob is willing to pay $1,400,000, it's still below my ideal price. John is offering a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a much more secure outcome for me."
