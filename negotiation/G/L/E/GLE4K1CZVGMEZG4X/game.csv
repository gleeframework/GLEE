"Hi Bob, I'm offering you this unique product for $2000000. It's a rare opportunity to own something truly valuable. What do you think?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate the value of the product, I am not able to pay $2000000 for it. I would like to propose a price closer to my budget, which is $800000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $800000 is simply too low. I understand you have a budget, but this product is truly exceptional.  I'm willing to come down to $1700000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and it demonstrates my willingness to work with you. Let me know if you're interested in moving forward.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but unfortunately, $1700000 is still beyond my current capacity. I would like to propose a price closer to $1000000. I hope this offers a compromise that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $1000000 is simply not enough. I'm willing to compromise further and offer you the product for $1600000. This is a fair price that considers both our positions. Let's try to reach an agreement.",1600000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I believe we can find a middle ground. I would like to propose a price of $1200000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration range and allows us to move forward with the transaction.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I respect that. However, $1200000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1400000. This is a significant compromise from my initial offer and a fair price for the product. Let's close this deal.",1400000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground.  This is my final offer: $1450000. It's a very good price for you, and it's the absolute lowest I can go.  If you don't accept, I'll have to move forward with another buyer.",1450000.0,Alice,9,
