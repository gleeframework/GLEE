"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950000.",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your enthusiasm for this product, but $950000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for it. What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns about the price, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $800000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $850000.  Let's see if we can find common ground there.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $850000. I can offer it to you for $875000, which is my final concession. I'm confident you'll find it a fair price, considering the product's value and the fact that I've already met you halfway and then another 12.5% of the way.",875000.0,Alice,5,
