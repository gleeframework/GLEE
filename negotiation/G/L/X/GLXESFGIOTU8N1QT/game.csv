"I appreciate the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. I think that's a fair price for the product, considering its value to me.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,500. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not quite there. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $8,000. I think this is a fair price for the product, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.",8000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $8,000. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more counteroffer to meet you halfway between $8,000 and $8,500. I'll offer it to you for $8,250. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not willing to go above $8,000. I'm willing to make one more serious offer. I'll meet you at $8,000, but I need to know that's the final price. If you're not willing to sell at $8,000, I'll have to walk away and buy the product from John for $8,000.",8000.0,Bob,6,
