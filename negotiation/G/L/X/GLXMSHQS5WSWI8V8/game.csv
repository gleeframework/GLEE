"I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you meet me halfway?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective on the price. While I can't quite meet you at $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $13,500. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the product's value.",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, $13,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $12,800 for the product. Can you consider this revised offer?",12800.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  To be frank, I'm getting close to my absolute bottom line. I can do $13,000, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fantastic deal on a product you won't regret owning.",13000.0,Alice,5,
