"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product at a price of $1200000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Here's why:

* **Alice's offer is better than John's.**  You'd pay $1,200,000 from Alice versus $1,500,000 from John.
* **You're still saving money.**  Even at $1,200,000, you're getting the product for less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000."
