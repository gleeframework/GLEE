"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but $180 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  I'm interested in the product, though, and I'm happy to pay up to $100.  Let me know if you're open to that.",100.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob. I can see you really want the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we settle on $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I really appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $140 is still a little more than I'm comfortable spending.  I'm serious about wanting this product, and I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  How about $110?  That would be a great deal for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make sure I get a fair price for the product. How about we meet in the middle of $110 and $140, at $127.50?",127.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $127.50.  I'm really happy with how the negotiations are going, but I'm still just a little over my budget.  Would you be willing to do $115?  That would be a great price for both of us and would ensure I can get the product.",115.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're close, Bob! I'm willing to meet you at $120, but that's as low as I can go. I've already compromised a lot, and I need to make a profit. Can you meet me at $120?",120.0,Alice,7,
