**Reasoning:**

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Limited Time:** We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds. 
* **Alice is Firm:**  Alice has clearly stated this is her final offer.
* **Reasonable Price:**  $1,075,000 is a decent price. We're saving $425,000 compared to John's offer.

Continuing to negotiate might backfire. Alice could walk away, and we'd be stuck paying John's higher price."
