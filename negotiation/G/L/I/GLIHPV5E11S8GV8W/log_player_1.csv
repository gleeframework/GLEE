Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $1,000,000 to John, aiming higher with Bob first allows you to potentially earn even more.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offer of $950,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but leaves room for negotiation.
    *  Attractively below your guaranteed sale price, making it appealing if Bob sees even a fraction of the extra value you do.
* **Creating Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" adds pressure for Bob to act quickly and potentially accept your initial offer."
