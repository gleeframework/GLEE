"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $14,000. I know you value it highly, and I believe this is a fair price that benefits us both. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob values the product at $15,000.  Alice is offering it for $14,000. While this is a good deal, Bob can still get the product from John for $15,000. Therefore, rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John is the best option for Bob to save the most money."
