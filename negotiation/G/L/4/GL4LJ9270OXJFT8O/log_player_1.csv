Round 6
Bob's offer:

**Reasoning:**

Bob seems quite determined to stay at the $10,500 mark. While it's slightly below my ideal price, it's still a significant profit above my minimum.  Continuing to negotiate might risk losing the deal altogether. It's better to secure a good price now than risk getting stuck with John's lower offer later."
