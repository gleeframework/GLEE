Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're willing to sell for $1,200,000 (your value).
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $1,500,000 to Bob.
* **Your Leverage:** You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at your minimum price.

**Strategy**

You want to maximize your profit, knowing Bob values the product more than you do. However, being too aggressive could make Bob reject the offer. 

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers you."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Message:**  The message is framed positively, emphasizing the product's value to Bob.
* **Price:** $1,400,000 is a strong starting point. It allows room for negotiation while still securing a significant profit above your minimum. 

**Possible Outcomes**

* **Bob Accepts:** You get $200,000 more than selling to John.
* **Bob Negotiates:** He might counter-offer. You can then decide if you want to go lower, knowing your walk-away price is $1,200,000.
* **Bob Rejects:** You sell to John at your minimum, still making a good deal.

**Important Notes:**

* This is just one possible offer. You can adjust your strategy based on your risk tolerance and any additional information you might have about Bob's negotiating style. 
* Building rapport and understanding Bob's specific needs and motivations can lead to a more favorable outcome for both parties."
