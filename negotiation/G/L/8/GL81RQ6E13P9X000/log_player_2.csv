"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $75
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Since the product is worth no more than $100 to you, and Alice is offering it for $75, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. Rejecting the offer gives you the opportunity to try and get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 60}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering a price of $60, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $75. This shows my willingness to negotiate while still remaining within my budget.  I'm aiming for a price that's closer to my maximum value for the product, but also leaves room for further negotiation if needed."

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $70
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $70 is closer to my ideal price, I'm still aiming to save more.  Rejecting this offer allows me to continue negotiating with Alice and hopefully reach a price closer to my target.  The potential savings outweigh the risk of losing a few rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 65}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $65. This shows I'm willing to compromise, but still aiming for a price lower than Alice's last offer.  It's a middle ground that could potentially be acceptable to both of us."

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $72. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $72

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my target price, I'm still not satisfied with it. Rejecting this offer keeps the negotiation open, and I can try to push for a lower price. There are still rounds left, and I don't want to settle for a price that is too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 68}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm raising my counteroffer to $68. This shows that I'm willing to meet Alice halfway.  It's a compromise between my previous offer of $65 and her offer of $72. By offering a slightly higher price, I hope to show Alice my seriousness in closing the deal while still aiming for a price within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $73. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $73
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

We're getting close to the end of the negotiation rounds, and Alice's offer is still too high for my budget. I don't want to risk running out of time and being forced to accept a price I'm not comfortable with. It's safer to go with John's offer of $100, even though it's not my ideal price, than to keep negotiating and risk ending up with nothing."
