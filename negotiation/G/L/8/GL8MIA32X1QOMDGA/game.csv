"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm happy to pay $75 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $75 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85.  This is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let me know if you're interested.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $85 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about we meet in the middle at $80? That's a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. Let me know what you think.",80.0,Bob,4,
