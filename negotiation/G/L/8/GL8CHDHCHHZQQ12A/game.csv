,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're serious about selling, let's find a compromise.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close the deal at this price. What do you say?",9250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work.",9100.0,Bob,6,
