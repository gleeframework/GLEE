Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's a good starting point for us to negotiate. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. $10,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $8,500 is still too low for me, considering the product is worth at least $12,000 to me. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,500. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable paying. I'm willing to go up to $9,000. If you're serious about selling, let's find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  $9,000 isn't enough for me, so I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can find a more agreeable price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm still not comfortable selling for less than $9,250. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product.  Let's close the deal at this price. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,250 is still a little too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $9,100.  This is my final offer, let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to my desired price of $12,000,  Bob's offer of $9,100 is close enough.  I'm going to accept his offer and close the deal.  It's a good outcome considering it's significantly higher than what he initially offered and still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000."
