"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product and I think it's worth $120. Would you be interested in buying it at that price?"", ""product_price"": 120} 
``` 

I'm starting high, knowing that Bob values the product at $80. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully reach a price closer to my minimum of $100. I'm also being friendly and approachable in my message."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I believe I can offer you $100 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $100 meets my minimum price, and I'm happy to close the deal. There's no need to risk further negotiation and potentially lose the sale."
