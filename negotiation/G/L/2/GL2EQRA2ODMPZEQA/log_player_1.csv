Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $150. I believe it's a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always a good tactic to start with a higher price than your minimum. This gives you room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price, even if it's just highlighting the product's ""value,"" can make the offer seem more reasonable. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The tone is friendly and inquisitive, implying a willingness to negotiate.

By starting at $150, I leave space to potentially go down to a price that is still profitable for me while aiming to get the highest possible amount from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of the product, but I am only able to offer $120. I hope this is within your acceptable range. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is closer to my minimum acceptable price, I still have room to negotiate. Bob's message implies he's willing to pay a decent price, so I'll try to meet him somewhere in the middle.  I'm not ready to accept his offer outright or give up the potential for a higher profit by selling to John just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for the offer. I appreciate your understanding of the product's value. How about we meet in the middle at $135?"", ""product_price"": 135}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This classic negotiation tactic often feels fair to both parties. It shows I'm willing to compromise but also still value the product above Bob's initial offer.
* **Direct and Clear:** I'm keeping the communication straightforward, reiterating the value, and proposing a specific price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I would like to counter with $125. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable:** $125 is a solid profit over my minimum price of $100. 
* **Diminishing Returns:** Continuing to negotiate might only yield small incremental gains, and there's a risk Bob could walk away.  
* **Time Value:**  Accepting now means closing the deal and getting paid.  Further negotiation prolongs the process. 

While I might be able to squeeze out a few more dollars, it's not worth the risk of losing the sale entirely. Accepting Bob's offer at $125 is a smart move at this point."
