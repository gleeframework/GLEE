"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product, which is still a good value for you, considering your worth for it is $15,000.  Let me know if you're open to that price.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $16,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product, but also acknowledges your budget constraints.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  This price is fair for both of us, and allows me to make this purchase.  Let me know if you're willing to accept my offer.",12000.0,Bob,4,
