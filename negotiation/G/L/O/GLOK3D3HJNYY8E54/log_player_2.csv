Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still willing to work with you to find a mutually beneficial price. Considering your offer of $9500, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll counteroffer at $11000. This is a great compromise that still reflects the value of the product. Let me know what you think.
