,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, your product seems interesting, but $1,500,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your position. However, the value of this product is truly unique and I've already had significant interest from other parties.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,350,000. This is my best offer.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have other offers, but $1,350,000 is still beyond my budget. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,150,000, which is a significant amount for me. I believe this reflects the value of the product and is a fair price for both of us. Let's find a solution that works.",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm trying to be flexible, but the value of this product is firmly above $1,200,000.  To be fair, I'll accept $1,275,000. This is my final offer.",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,275,000 is still stretching my budget. I'm ready to pay $1,200,000, which is a substantial amount for me, and I believe it reflects the product's value. This is my final offer, let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,6,
