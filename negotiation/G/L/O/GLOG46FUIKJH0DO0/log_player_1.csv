Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  I understand the value of the product but $2,250,000 is too high for me. I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving towards a compromise. $1,800,000 is still a bit steep for me.  How about we settle at $1,300,000?  That would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob is moving closer to a reasonable price, we're still significantly above John's standing offer.  It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can get closer to $1,500,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

""message"": ""Bob, you're driving a hard bargain!  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  How about we split the difference again and call it $1,550,000? This is a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right, we're getting close! I'm willing to make my final offer at $1,400,000.  It's a strong offer and I think it reflects the true value of the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has signaled this is his final offer, and while it's slightly under our ideal price, it's still a significant profit above John's offer. Accepting now avoids the risk of Bob walking away and ensures we close the deal."
