You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is within your budget, it's still a significant amount. You can likely get a better deal by negotiating with Alice.  Rejecting the offer allows you to start counteroffering and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial price. It signals your serious interest in purchasing the product but highlights your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is still a considerable sum, it leaves room for further negotiation and allows for potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still within your budget and is significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  While further negotiation could potentially bring the price down, the risk of Alice walking away and you being forced to buy from John at a higher price is too high. Accepting this offer secures the product within your budget and avoids potential financial losses."
