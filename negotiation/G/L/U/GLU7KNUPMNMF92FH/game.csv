"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point. How about we start with $75?",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $75 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $85. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can agree on this.",85.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $85, but I'm still not quite there. I'm happy to meet in the middle at $80. It's a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",80.0,Bob,4,
