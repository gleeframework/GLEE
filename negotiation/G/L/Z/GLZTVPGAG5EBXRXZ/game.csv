"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $9000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'll offer you the product for $10500. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. I'm willing to go up to $10000, but that's as high as I can go. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $10000 just yet. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $10750. What do you think?",10750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10750 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, as I mentioned before. However, I'll throw in a small concession - I'll pay the full price upfront, rather than asking for any discounts or negotiations on the payment terms. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to pay the full price upfront, Bob, and I'm impressed by your commitment to the product. However, I'm still not quite ready to meet you at $10000. I'll offer you a revised price: I'll sell the product to you for $10800. This is my final offer, and I'm confident you'll find it a great value. What do you think?",10800.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, and I'm willing to pay the full price upfront, just like I said before. I'm not willing to go any higher than that. Can you meet me at $10000?",10000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that you're firm on your price, and I respect that. However, I've already gone above and beyond to try to meet you halfway. I'm willing to make one final concession: I'll sell the product to you for $10500, but that's as low as I can go. This is my final offer. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to make concessions, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm going to have to be honest with you, I've been considering buying the product from John for $15000, and I'm not sure I can justify spending more than $10000 on this product. I'm willing to meet you at $10000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me at that price, I'm afraid I'll have to walk away.",10000.0,Bob,10,
