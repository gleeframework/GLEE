"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its immense potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your time and consideration, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $950,000. This is a fair price for me, considering the product's value to me is $800,000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $950,000 is significantly below its true value and my initial asking price.  I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,050,000. This offer reflects the product's worth and ensures a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking to get a good price for the product, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",1025000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. However, $1,025,000 is still too low for me to accept. I'm willing to consider a final offer of $1,040,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair deal for both of us.",1040000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,040,000. I'm willing to go up to $1,020,000, which is my final offer. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",1020000.0,Bob,6,
