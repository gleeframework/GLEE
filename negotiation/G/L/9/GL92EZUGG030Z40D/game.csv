"Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,500.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you're willing to negotiate. However, $9,500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $9,000.",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,000 is still outside my budget.  I'm really hoping to close this deal at $8,250.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to move forward with the purchase.  What do you say?",8250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $8,250. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $8,750. This is the lowest I'm willing to go.",8750.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I'm willing to meet you at $8,500.  This is a fair price considering we've both been willing to compromise.  Let's make this deal happen.",8500.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I'm not willing to accept $8,500, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer it to you for $8,750, but this is my final offer. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider other options.",8750.0,Alice,7,
