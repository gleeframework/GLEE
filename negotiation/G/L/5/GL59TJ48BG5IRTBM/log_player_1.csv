Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would be highly beneficial to you. I'm looking for a price around $18,000 to make it worthwhile for me. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 18000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's generally wise to start negotiations with an offer higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit. 
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's benefit to Bob and framing the price as ""worthwhile,"" you are anchoring the value in his mind.
* **Leaving the Door Open:**  The phrase ""What do you think?"" encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation rather than simply saying yes or no.

**Important Considerations:**

* **Bob's Perspective:** While you know Bob values the product at $12,000, he doesn't know you have a guaranteed buyer at that price. This lack of information on his part can work in your favor.
* **Risk Tolerance:**  A higher initial offer carries the risk of Bob rejecting it outright. However, since you have John as a backup buyer, you are not at risk of losing the $12,000 value."
