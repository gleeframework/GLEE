"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $1,000,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?  It's a fair price that still gives you a significant advantage.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to go down to $950,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can meet at this price.",950000.0,Bob,4,
