"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $95 is a bit steep for me. Would you be willing to consider a price of $85? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I will reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price.  $85 is still below my minimum, and I think I can get closer to my desired price with a counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $90? It's still a good deal for you, considering the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with $90. Would you be willing to meet me at $87.50? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $87.50 is closer to my minimum, I'm still confident I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.  There are still several rounds left, and I don't want to rush into a deal that doesn't benefit me enough."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $87.50 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $88.50? I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 88.5}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $88.50. Would you be willing to meet me at $86? I'm trying to stay within my budget, and this is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $86 is a good offer and close to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try for another counteroffer.  I'm feeling confident that we can reach an agreement that works for both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I can't go any lower than $87. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find it to be a good value. Let's make a deal!"", ""product_price"": 87}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I'm still not comfortable with $87. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $86 and $87. Would you be willing to sell it to me for $86.50? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $86.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $86.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While it's only a small amount over my minimum, I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  There are only two rounds left, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely.  $86.50 is a decent profit, and it's better than selling to John for $80."
