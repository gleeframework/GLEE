Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $11,500. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting with $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Time Value:**  Selling to Bob quickly avoids the delay of going to John, even if John offers a guaranteed $10,000."
