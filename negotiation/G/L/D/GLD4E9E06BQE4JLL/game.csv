"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at this point.  I'm hoping to get it for around $105. Would you be open to that?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $135. This is my best price for now.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $135 is still a bit high for me.  I'm really hoping to get it for closer to $115.  If we can get to that number, we have a deal.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, but I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I can offer it to you for $130. This is as low as I can go, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this price.",130.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $130 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really hoping we can settle on $120.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",120.0,Bob,6,
