"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer. While I understand your desire to save, $1,200,000 is unfortunately below my minimum acceptable price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000, which is still a great deal for you considering the value you'll get from the product.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for the best deal, but $1,250,000 is still too far below my minimum. To make this work for both of us, I'm willing to offer the product for $1,350,000. This is a fair price that allows you to save significantly while also giving me a reasonable profit. It's my final offer, so let me know if you're interested.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
