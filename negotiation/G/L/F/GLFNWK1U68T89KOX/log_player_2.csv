"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's goal:** Save as much money as possible while still acquiring the product.
* **Alice's offer:** $11,500 is higher than Bob's ideal price point of $10,000.
* **Potential for better deal:**  There are 9 rounds left, leaving room for negotiation and potentially lowering the price.

**Next Steps:** Bob should counteroffer with a lower price to see if Alice is willing to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $10,500. This is a fair price for both of us and allows me to stay within my budget. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** Bob wants to start by pushing for a price closer to his desired $10,000, while still being within a reasonable range to potentially reach a deal with Alice.
* **Motivational Message:** The message emphasizes a fair price for both parties, aiming to nudge Alice toward accepting a lower price.

**Next Steps:** 
* If Alice rejects this counteroffer, Bob will need to analyze her subsequent counteroffer and adjust his strategy for the next round. 
* If Alice accepts, Bob successfully negotiates a lower price!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm not quite ready to go that low. How about $11,000? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a compromise. Let's keep talking! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's Offer:** $11,000 is still above Bob's ideal price point, but closer than the initial offer.
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:** There are still 7 rounds left, providing opportunities for Bob to continue negotiating a lower price. 

**Next Steps:** Bob should counteroffer again, aiming for a price closer to his desired $10,500. This will show Alice that he's serious about getting a better deal and encourage further negotiations."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I'm willing to meet you halfway. $10,750 is a reasonable price that allows both of us to reach an agreement.  This is my final offer, let's get this deal done."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a compromise, demonstrating a willingness to meet Alice halfway. It also places the burden on Alice to either accept or risk potentially losing the deal.
* **Finality:**  The message clearly states that this is Bob's final offer, increasing the pressure on Alice to make a decision.
* **Timing:**  With 6 rounds remaining, Bob needs to start narrowing the gap and pushing for a final agreement.

**Next Steps:** 
* If Alice rejects, Bob needs to carefully assess his next move. He has options like increasing the price slightly (but not significantly) or staying firm and risking losing the deal.
* If Alice accepts, Bob achieves a successful negotiation, securing the product at a price below his initial maximum."
