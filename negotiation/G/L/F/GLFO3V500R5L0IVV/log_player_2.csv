You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

It's not a good deal for Bob to pay $9,000 when he's willing to pay up to $8,000. It's better to try to negotiate with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:

Bob is still aiming for a price lower than $8,000. It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice."
