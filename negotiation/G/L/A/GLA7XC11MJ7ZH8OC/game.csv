"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product for $1500000. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity to own a truly unique item. I believe it's worth every penny, but I'm willing to listen to your thoughts and see if we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product, but given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the price of $1500000. I am willing to pay up to $800000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",800000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was really hoping to get closer to my initial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm now offering the product to you for $1200000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great value for the product. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. While I understand your need to make a profit, I'm still working within a specific budget. I would like to propose a price of $900000 for the product. I hope this proposal is within your consideration. Looking forward to your response.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I appreciate your persistence, and I'm willing to meet you halfway again. However, I'm not quite ready to accept $900000. I'm now offering the product to you for $1100000. This is my final compromise, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. If you're still interested, let me know, but if not, I'll have to consider other options.",1100000.0,Alice,5,
