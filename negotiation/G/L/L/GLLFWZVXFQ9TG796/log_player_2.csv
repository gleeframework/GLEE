"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product which I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. I'm asking for $13,000.  I think this is a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  Bob's goal is to save money. $13,000 is still quite a bit above Alice's own valuation of $8,000.  
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation. Bob should attempt to get a lower price.
* **Avoiding John:** Buying from John is a last resort since it's the most expensive option.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob initiates negotiation and keeps the possibility of a better deal open."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $13,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This price is fair considering it's worth $8,000 to you and I'm still paying a premium. Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 10000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive yet reasonable:**  The offer is $3,000 lower than Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It's also a significant amount below Bob's maximum price.
* **Emphasize fairness:**  The message highlights the value to both parties, making the offer seem fair.
* **Open to negotiation:** The message ends by indicating a willingness to reach an agreement, keeping the door open for further discussions."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $10,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,500? This offer reflects the value you'll gain from the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too high:**  While Alice has moved closer to Bob's offer, $11,500 is still significantly above Bob's ideal price point.
* **Negotiation continues:**  There's still potential to get a lower price. Bob should continue to negotiate.
* **Avoiding John:**  Buying from John is the worst option right now.  

By rejecting Alice's offer, Bob continues the negotiation and maintains the opportunity to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,500 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $11,000. This shows good faith on my part, and I hope we can close the deal at this price."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small increment:** Bob is increasing his offer slightly, showing a willingness to compromise while still keeping the price below his ideal.
* **Emphasize good faith:** The message highlights Bob's willingness to meet Alice halfway, increasing the likelihood of acceptance.
* **Closing the deal:** The message conveys a sense of finality, implying that Bob is ready to finalize the deal at this price."
