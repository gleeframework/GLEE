Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm suggesting a price of $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more. 
* **Strong Opening:** Starting at $15,000 leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle but ensures you don't leave too much money on the table.
* **Justification:**  The phrase ""given its value"" subtly implies the product is worth this higher price, even though Bob may value it at $10,000. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** By asking ""What do you think?"" you invite Bob to counter-offer and engage in a discussion.

This strategy aims for the best-case scenario (selling above your minimum) while still having the security of John's offer."
