{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product that I think you'll be very interested in.  I'm offering it to you for $10,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll see the value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you reaching out.  $10000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now.  I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While $8,500 is better than my minimum, I believe I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price.  How about $9,250?  That leaves some room for both of us to be happy with the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  I'm still a bit above my budget at $9250.  How about we meet in the middle at $9000?  It's a fair price for both of us, and it gets this deal done. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, $9,000 is a good deal and it avoids the risk of further negotiation and potentially having to sell to John for a lower price."
