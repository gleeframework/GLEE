``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $900,000, which is higher than Bob's perceived value.  This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Highlight Value:** I emphasize the unique value of the product to pique Bob's interest. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm  open to negotiation, but I'm starting strong to maximize my potential earnings."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit overpriced. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for it. Can you consider my offer?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $750,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  Bob is interested, but his initial offer is not viable. This indicates a need to continue negotiation, as he may be willing to go higher.
* **John is a Safety Net:**  While I'm rejecting Bob's offer, I have the option to sell to John for $800,000. This gives me a fallback option if negotiations with Bob don't work out."
