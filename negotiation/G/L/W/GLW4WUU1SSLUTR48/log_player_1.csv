Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to keep negotiating, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for this product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,075,000 is still a significant undervaluation of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, acknowledging the value you bring to the deal. Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 1125000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,100,000?  This keeps us moving forward and avoids dragging out the negotiation. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I need to ensure I receive fair value for this exceptional product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to close this deal as well. How about we settle at $1,106,000? This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping you'll agree so we can both move forward.

I've been negotiating with Bob for a while, and while we're getting closer, we haven't quite reached a price I'm comfortable with.  To avoid further negotiations and ensure I get a fair price, I'll accept John's offer and sell the product to him for $1,200,000."
