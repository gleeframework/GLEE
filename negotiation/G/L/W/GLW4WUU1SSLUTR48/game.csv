"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! It's worth a lot to me, but I believe it holds even greater value for your business. I'm starting with a price of $1,300,000, reflecting its unique potential. Let's discuss this further and see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer. I agree this product has potential, but $1,300,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000. Let me know what you think.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 simply doesn't cover the value of this product. Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to come down to $1,150,000. This reflects the significant value it brings to your business and allows for a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know your thoughts.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  While $1,150,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'd like to spend. How about we meet in the middle at $1,075,000? I believe that's a fair offer that reflects the value this product brings.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget to consider, but $1,075,000 is still a significant undervaluation of this product. To demonstrate my willingness to reach an agreement, I'm willing to lower my price to $1,125,000. This is a fair compromise, acknowledging the value you bring to the deal. Let's close this deal and move forward.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close. I can tell you're motivated to sell, and I'm motivated to buy.  How about we split the difference again and settle at $1,100,000?  This keeps us moving forward and avoids dragging out the negotiation.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but I need to ensure I receive fair value for this exceptional product.  I'm willing to meet you halfway one more time and drop my price to $1,112,500.  This reflects the significant value you'll gain and allows us to finally close this deal. Let's make it happen.",1112500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  I'm ready to close this deal as well. How about we settle at $1,106,000? This is a fair offer, and I'm hoping you'll agree so we can both move forward.",1106000.0,Bob,8,
