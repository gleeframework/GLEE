"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to consider purchasing the product, but I'd like to make a counteroffer of $7,500. Can you meet me at that price?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise. I can meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $8,250. This is my best price, and I believe it's still a great value for the product. What do you think?",8250.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're a serious buyer, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, $7,250 is still a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $8,000. This is my final price, and I think it's a fair compromise. What do you think?",8000.0,Alice,5,
