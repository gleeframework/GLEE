"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1750000. I know it's a great value, and I believe it will be a fantastic asset for you. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. It's worthwhile to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,750,000 is far beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for this product, which is still a significant amount for me. I hope we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident this product is worth more than $1000000. I'm willing to come down to $1250000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product while also being within a reasonable range for you. Let's work together to make this happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is still above your budget. You have three options:

1. **Accept Alice's offer:** This is the most expensive option, and it puts you significantly over your budget. 
2. **Reject Alice's offer:** This gives you more negotiation room and potentially a better deal. You can try to get the price closer to your budget.
3. **Buy from John:**  This is the safest option, as it guarantees the product at your maximum budget. 

Given that Alice is showing a willingness to negotiate, it makes sense to continue the negotiation and try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $1,250,000 is still a bit higher than I can afford. Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to offer $1,100,000.  I'm sure we can find a way to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence and willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to drop my price to $1150000. This is a significant concession on my part, but I believe it's a fair compromise given your budget. Let's close this deal and get this product in your hands. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your budget. However, it's getting closer to your maximum.  It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price. It's possible Alice will be more willing to negotiate given that we are already in Round 5.  

While buying from John is always an option, it's worth trying to get the best possible price from Alice.  You have more rounds left and can potentially save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,150,000 is getting closer, it's still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to offer $1,125,000 for the product. This is a significant step up from my previous offer, and I believe it reflects the value of the product while still being within my budget. Let's reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 1125000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but I'm firm on my last offer of $1150000.  This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit margin for me. It's a win-win situation.  Let's not let this opportunity slip away. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has stated she is firm on her last offer of $1,150,000. This is still above your budget, and there is a strong possibility that further negotiation will not result in a lower price. You have already made several counteroffers and Alice has consistently rejected them.

It's better to secure the product now from John at $1,000,000. This guarantees you the product within your budget and avoids further negotiation with Alice.  While you might save more by continuing, there's a risk that you won't get a deal at all."
