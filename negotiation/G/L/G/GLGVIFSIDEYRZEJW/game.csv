"Alice, your offer is a bit high for my budget. I'm really interested in this product, but I can only go up to $11,000 at this point. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $11,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a price of $13,500. This is a fair compromise that still allows me to cover my costs and make a profit. What do you think?",13500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $12,500, but I'd like to propose a slight adjustment. I can offer you the product for $13,000, which is a small premium that still leaves room for both of us to make a profit. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,5,
