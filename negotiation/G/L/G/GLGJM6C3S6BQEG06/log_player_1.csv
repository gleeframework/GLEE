"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $10,000. This is a fairly aggressive opening offer, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I'm aiming high to see if I can maximize my profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $7,500 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable value of $8,000.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $9,000. This is still a significant markup from Bob's offer but represents a compromise from my initial asking price.  I believe it's a fair price considering my minimum value and the potential for further negotiations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob keeps dropping his offer. Although $7,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm going to reject it and try one more counteroffer. If it fails, I'll sell to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $8,500. This is a significant compromise from my previous offer but still above my minimum value. I'm hoping Bob sees the value of the product and is willing to meet me halfway. If he doesn't, I'll move on to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is unwilling to budge on his offer, and I've already made several concessions.  While $7,500 is more than what I originally thought I'd get, I'm running out of time, and I need to be sure to secure a sale that meets my minimum.  I'm going to sell to John for $8,000.  It's not ideal, but it's a reliable option that guarantees my desired outcome."
