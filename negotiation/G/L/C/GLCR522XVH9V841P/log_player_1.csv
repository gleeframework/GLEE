Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $14,000."", 
""product_price"": 14000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($15,000) as possible. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering $14,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still securing a price significantly higher than John's offer.
* **Strong but Fair:** This price point positions the offer as a good deal for Bob while still ensuring a substantial profit for you."
