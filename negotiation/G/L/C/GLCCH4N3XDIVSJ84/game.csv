"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I'm willing to pay a premium for this product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me halfway?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While I understand your budget constraints, $900000 is simply too low for me.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1000000.  This price still reflects the significant value this product brings to your business, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're working with a budget, but $950000 simply doesn't cover my costs. To make this work, I'm willing to go down to $975000. This is a small step closer to your offer and would be a mutually beneficial agreement. Let's find a way to close this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
