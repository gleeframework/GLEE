Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you reaching out, but your initial offer of $2,300,000 is significantly higher than what I'm comfortable with. Considering my budget and the value I see in this product, I'm willing to offer $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident it's a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Explanation:

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still significantly less than what John is offering.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob has a risk - I might not be able to get him close enough to my $1,500,000 minimum. John represents a guaranteed sale at my desired price. It makes the most financial sense to take the guaranteed offer from John."
