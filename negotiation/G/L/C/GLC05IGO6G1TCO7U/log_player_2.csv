"Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob values the product at $10,000.  Alice's offer of $9,500 is better than John's offer of $10,000, but it's still above Bob's desired price.  By rejecting, Bob can try to negotiate further with Alice or potentially find a better deal elsewhere."
