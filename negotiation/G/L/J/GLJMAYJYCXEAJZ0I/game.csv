"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $18,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $14,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer you the product for $16,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings, and I believe it's a great opportunity for us to come to an agreement.",16500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $16,500 is still a bit out of my range. I'm willing to go up to $15,500 for the product. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.  I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement.",15500.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $15,500, but I'd like to get closer to my original offer of $18,000. How about we meet in the middle at $16,250? This is a fair price that I'm comfortable with, and I believe it's a good compromise considering the value of the product.",16250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective and appreciate you coming down in price.  However, $16,250 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to offer a final price of $15,250.  This is a significant compromise on my end, and I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement.",15250.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal. However, $15,250 is still a bit lower than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. How about we meet at $16,000? This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value.",16000.0,Alice,7,
