"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a little steep for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit high, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,050,000. How about we meet in the middle at $1,125,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll love the product.",1125000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're close to making a decision, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $1,100,000. How about we try $1,115,000? It's a small concession, but I think it's worth considering. You'll still be getting an amazing deal on this product.",1115000.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stick to your budget, and I appreciate your honesty. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1,105,000. How about we meet in the middle again at $1,110,000? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",1110000.0,Alice,7,
