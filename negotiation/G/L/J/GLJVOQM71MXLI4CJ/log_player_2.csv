Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's lower than the initial $20,000, it's still above his $10,000 limit. It's better to keep negotiating and see if he can get closer to his target price."

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's getting closer to his desired price, it's still above his budget. He can try to negotiate further with Alice, or he can choose to buy from John at his predetermined price."

Alice's offer:

At this point, Bob should choose to buy from John.  

* Alice is coming down in price, but she's still above Bob's $10,000 limit.
* There's no guarantee that Alice will accept a counteroffer, and the negotiations could go on indefinitely.
* Buying from John guarantees Bob the product at his desired price, saving him time and potential frustration."
