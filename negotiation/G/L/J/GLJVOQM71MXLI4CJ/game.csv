,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I'm still trying to get the best deal, but $14000 is still a bit too high.  How about $13000? It's a fair compromise, and we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm not quite there yet, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about $14500? It's still a bit above what you're willing to pay, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again.",14500.0,Alice,7,
