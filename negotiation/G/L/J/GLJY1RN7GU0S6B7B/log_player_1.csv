Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $95. I believe it will provide you with excellent value, even at this slightly higher price."", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While Bob only values the product at $80, starting with an offer slightly below your guaranteed sale price ($100) gives you room to negotiate if needed.
* **Justification:** Providing a reason for the price (even if it's just perceived ""value"") can make the offer more palatable.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  If Bob outright rejects $95, there's a chance he might counter-offer within a range acceptable to you, allowing you to potentially earn more than selling to John."
