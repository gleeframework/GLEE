"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $110. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $100 to Alice, and she's offering it for $110.  As Bob, you can likely get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows you to counteroffer and try to save more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it!  However,  $110 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $112.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $112.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $112.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $112.50 is better than Alice's initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point. You're willing to pay up to $120, but you want to save as much as possible. Rejecting this offer allows you to counteroffer again and try to get closer to your target price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $105.  Would you consider $107.50?  I think that's a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 107.5}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $108
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice has come down to $108, which is within your price range of $120. While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely you won't get a better deal, and you risk losing the opportunity to purchase the product altogether. Accepting the offer at $108 allows you to secure the product while saving $12 compared to buying from John."
