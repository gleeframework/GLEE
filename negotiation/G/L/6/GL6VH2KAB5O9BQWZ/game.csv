"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it!  However,  $110 is a bit more than I'd like to spend.  How about $105? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I was thinking more along the lines of $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though - how about $112.50? It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product.",112.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm still aiming for a price closer to $105.  Would you consider $107.50?  I think that's a fair compromise.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Bob, and I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet in the middle at $108? It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the product.",108.0,Alice,5,
