"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you a product that has the potential to be incredibly valuable. I'm confident it's worth at least $800000 to me, and I believe it could be even more valuable to the right buyer. I'm willing to let you purchase it for $1000000. This is a significant discount from its true value.  Let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice is offering the product for $1,000,000, which is less than your maximum budget of $1,200,000. Accepting her offer saves you $200,000 compared to buying from John.  Even though Alice mentions the product could be worth more, you don't have enough information to determine if that's true.  It's always best to take advantage of a lower price when available."
