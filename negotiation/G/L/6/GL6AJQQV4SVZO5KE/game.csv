"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but that price is a little high for me. How about we settle at $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $850,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $950,000?  This is still a great deal for you, as the product is worth $1,000,000 to you. Let's see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. While $950,000 is better, I'm aiming for something around $900,000. Would you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  $900,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and we can close the deal.",925000.0,Alice,5,
