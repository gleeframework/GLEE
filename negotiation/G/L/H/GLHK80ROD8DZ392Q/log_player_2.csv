"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this amazing product that I think you'll love. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $8,000 is within your budget, but it's still above your goal of saving as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows you to attempt to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested but $8,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $7,000 for the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $7000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can offer it to you for $9500. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $9,500 is still too high for me.  I'm trying to save as much money as possible, and buying from John for $10,000 is still a better option. Rejecting the offer allows me to continue negotiating and try to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $9,500 is still above my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $7,000. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 7000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to make a living. I can offer it to you for $8500. Let's see if we can make a deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $8,500 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a lower price.  I can potentially get a better deal by continuing to negotiate. It's worth the risk to see if I can get Alice to come down further."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $8,500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $8,000. This is a fair price considering the value I place on the product and my budget. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
