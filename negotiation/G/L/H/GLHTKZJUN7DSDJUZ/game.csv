"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $1,900,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and compromise on the price. What do you think?",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, however, the product's value is significantly higher than your proposed price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This feels like a fair compromise that reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the product's value, but I still think $1,700,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and propose a counteroffer of $1,600,000. I'm trying to find a mutually beneficial price, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",1600000.0,Bob,4,
