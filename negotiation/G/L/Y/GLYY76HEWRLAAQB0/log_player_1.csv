Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 170}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum ($150) but less than John's offer ($170) to leave room for negotiation.  This will hopefully entice Bob to make a counteroffer, allowing us to find a price we both agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price. I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my minimum."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm offering $145, which is halfway between my minimum and Bob's offer. This should show Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I'm not desperate to sell at his price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $130 is below my minimum acceptable price of $150.  While I could continue to negotiate, I'm not confident that I can get a higher price from Bob.  Therefore, I'm going to sell the product to John for $150."
