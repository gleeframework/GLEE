"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $5,000 for the product. Let me know what you think.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $5,000 is far too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is still a great price for you, considering the value you've stated. Let's try to find a compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm getting closer to what I can afford. How about $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see you're making an effort to meet me halfway, and I appreciate that. However, $6,500 is still too low for me. How about we settle on $8,000?  This price reflects the value of the product, and I believe it's fair for both of us.",8000.0,Alice,5,
