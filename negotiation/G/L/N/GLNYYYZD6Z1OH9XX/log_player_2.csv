"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $900,000. This is a significant discount from what it's worth to me, and it gives you a chance to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's still advantageous for you.  Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up who is ready to purchase it for full price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
