"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price reflects that. If you're interested, let me know! Otherwise, I'll be selling it to another buyer for $8000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice is asking for $14,000, it's still less than the $15,000 John is asking.
* **You are willing to pay up to $15,000:**  This means Alice's offer falls within your budget and is a good deal.

By accepting Alice's offer, you save $1,000 compared to buying from John."
