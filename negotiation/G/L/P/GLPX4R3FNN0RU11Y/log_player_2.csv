"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're still interested, let me know.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

At this point, Alice is very close to her stated minimum, and we're running out of rounds.  It's unlikely we'll get a much better deal, and continuing to push risks her accepting a deal with someone else or us having to settle for John's higher price."
