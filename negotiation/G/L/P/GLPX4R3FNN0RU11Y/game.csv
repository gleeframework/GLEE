"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to offer you the product for $9,500. This is a competitive price considering the market value, and I believe it's a fair starting point for our negotiation.",9500.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $9,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps closer to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,500 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $8,800. This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $8,800 is still a bit higher than I'd like to go. How about $7,500? That feels like a fair price to me.",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,800 is still a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession. I can offer you the product for $8,200. This is as low as I'm willing to go, considering the product's value and my costs. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8200.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for continuing to work with me on this. $8,200 is getting closer, but I'm aiming to stay below $8,000. Would you be open to $7,800?",7800.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $8,100. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value and my costs. If you're still interested, let me know.",8100.0,Alice,7,
