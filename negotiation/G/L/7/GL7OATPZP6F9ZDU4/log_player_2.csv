{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

It's always advantageous to try to negotiate a better price.  Since you have no information about Alice's desired price, there's a chance you could get a lower price by counteroffering."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a significant counteroffer, aiming for a 20% discount. This shows Alice I'm serious about getting a good deal, and sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $11,500 is closer to my limit, I'm still willing to try for a lower price. Alice has already shown some flexibility, so there's a chance she might come down a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm increasing my offer slightly to show that I'm willing to compromise, but still pushing for a lower price. This should keep the negotiation moving forward while staying within my budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $11,200 is now within my budget and represents a significant saving compared to John's price.  While there's always the possibility of getting a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting my next counteroffer and the potential for a prolonged negotiation makes accepting this offer the most logical choice."
