"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the opportunity to own this product,  $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $950,000 for it. This reflects the value I place on it, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still looking for a better deal. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, and I'm confident you'll find it a great investment.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $950,000. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident that this deal will be mutually beneficial.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,4,

This is the lowest price I'm comfortable with, considering the value I place on the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target. Can you reconsider your offer?",1030000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,030,000.  I'm willing to go up to $1,010,000. This is a significant step towards meeting your needs while still staying within my budget.  I believe this is a fair compromise that will allow us to close this deal.",1010000.0,Bob,6,
