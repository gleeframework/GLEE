"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to buy this valuable product from me. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $11000. This is a competitive price considering the product's worth to you is $12000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:**  While it's below your maximum, it's still above the product's worth to Alice. There's room for negotiation.
* **Exploring options:** It's better to see if you can get a better price by counteroffering. 
* **Jhon is a backup:**  Having Jhon as an option provides leverage in the negotiation."

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $10500.
