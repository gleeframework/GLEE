"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,100,000 is a good price, it's still a significant amount. Since we have 10 rounds, there's room to negotiate and potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting allows us to explore potential counteroffers and see if Alice is willing to drop the price further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm starting with a relatively aggressive counteroffer, aiming for a 20% reduction from Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that I'm serious about negotiating and willing to walk away if the price isn't right. However, the offer is still within my budget and leaves room for compromise in subsequent rounds."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is closer to my desired price, but still higher than I'd like to pay.  Since we're only in round 3, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting her offer allows me to continue the negotiation process and potentially push for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

My previous counteroffer of $900,000 was rejected, so I'm increasing it slightly to $950,000. This shows Alice that I'm willing to compromise, but still holding firm on my desire for a lower price.  It's a reasonable midpoint between my previous offer and her current offer, increasing the likelihood of acceptance."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer to get the price lower, Alice has shown she's not willing to budge much. Accepting her offer at $1,025,000 is still significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000.  We're in round 5, and time is running out.  It's a good deal, and I should secure the product now."
