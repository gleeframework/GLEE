Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,500. It's a great deal for a product worth $15,000 to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17500}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's slightly above the product's value to Bob, leaving room for negotiation.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm emphasizing the potential benefit to Bob (""great deal"") and not mentioning my own minimum.
* **Open to Negotiation:**  The message makes it clear I'm willing to negotiate, encouraging Bob to counteroffer.

**Next Steps:**

* **Analyze Bob's response:** If Bob rejects the offer, I'll assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer.
* **John as a Safety Net:**  Knowing John's offer gives me a baseline to ensure I don't accept a price lower than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product is worth $15,000 to me, so I would like to propose a price of $16,000 for the product. I hope this aligns better with your expectations. Looking forward to your response! 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Value & Negotiation:** Bob's offer of $16,000 is above my minimum of $15,000 and represents a successful negotiation.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While I could try to squeeze a bit more out of Bob, the potential for further negotiation might lead to a delay or even a complete breakdown. 
* **Opportunity Cost:** Selling to Bob now secures the profit and avoids the risk of a stalemate or a lower price from John.

**Next Steps:**

* **Finalizing the Transaction:** I'll move forward with the sale to Bob, finalizing the details and ensuring a smooth transaction."
