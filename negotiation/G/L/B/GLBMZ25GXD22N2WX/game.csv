"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase a high-value product that I think you'll really appreciate. I'm looking for $12,000 for it. Would you be interested?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $7,500 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $10,000 for the product. Would you be willing to consider that?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to go up to $8,200, but I need to be at or below that price to make this deal work for me.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting closer, but I still need to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to consider $9,500, which is a compromise between our previous offers. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit too far apart. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I really think that's the maximum I can go. Can you consider that?",8500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I can see that we're getting close, but I still think I can do better than $8,500. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but that's as low as I can go. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",9000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $8,750, and that's my final offer. I really think that's the best I can do.",8750.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I can see that you're getting close to your limit, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for less than $9,500. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target price. How about we meet at $9,250?",9250.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I've reached my limit, and I'm not willing to go any higher. I'm willing to walk away from the deal if we can't meet in the middle. I'll give you one last chance, and I'll meet you at $8,500, but that's as low as I can go. If not, I'll be buying from John for $8,000.",8500.0,Bob,10,
