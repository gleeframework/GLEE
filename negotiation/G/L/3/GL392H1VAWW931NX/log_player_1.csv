"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000.  It's a great deal, and I'm confident it will be worth every penny to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a high price, knowing Bob's valuation is lower. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and encouraging tone to build a good rapport with Bob.
* **Emphasis on Value:** I'm highlighting the value the product will bring to Bob, even though he's likely aware of it. 

**Strategy:**

* **Aim for Maximum Profit:** My goal is to get as close to my minimum value of $1,000,000 as possible.
* **Be Flexible:** I'm prepared to negotiate, but I won't settle for a price below my minimum value.
* **John as Backup:** The presence of John as a potential buyer gives me a safety net and leverage during negotiations."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the value of your product, but I am only willing to pay up to $950000. I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  While $950,000 is closer to my minimum value, it's still below my target. 
* **Potential for a Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation and I can likely get a higher price. 
* **John Provides Security:**  The ability to sell to John for $1,000,000 means I'm not pressured to accept Bob's offer.

**Next Steps:** 

I'll counter Bob's offer with a price closer to $1,000,000, aiming for a compromise."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I need to stay closer to my asking price.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000.

* **Strategic Reduction:**  I've reduced the price by a significant amount ($100,000) to show flexibility. 
* **Finding a Middle Ground:**  I'm aiming for a deal somewhere between my initial price and Bob's offer.
* **Time as a Factor:** I'm aware of the limited rounds, but I'm also not willing to sell below my minimum value quickly."

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with an offer of $1050000. This is higher than my previous offer, but still within my budget. I hope we can reach an agreement.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum value, but it's still $50,000 below it.
* **Time is Running Out:** We're only in round 4, and there's still potential for a better deal. 
* **John as Safety Net:** Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees I meet my minimum value. This gives me leverage to hold out for a slightly better price.

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer, aiming for a price closer to $1,075,000. This would split the difference between his current offer and my minimum value.  I will emphasize the value of the product and the opportunity to close the deal in this round."

* **Balancing Value and Time:** I'm balancing my desire for a higher price with the need to close the deal before resorting to my backup option."

* **Limited Rounds:** We're approaching the middle of the negotiation rounds, but there's still time to push for a better price.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Minimum Value Reached:** Bob's offer finally meets my minimum value of $1,000,000.
* **Time is a Factor:** We're in round 8, and time is running out. There's no guarantee that further negotiations will lead to a higher price.
* **No Significant Gain:** There's a low chance of Bob offering more, and even if he does, it's unlikely to be a significant increase. 

**Strategy:**

* **Guarantee My Minimum:** Accepting Bob's offer secures my minimum value and avoids the risk of a worse outcome in later rounds.
* **Time Optimization:**  This decision saves time and allows me to move on to other potential opportunities.
* **Avoiding Further Delay:** While I might get a slightly higher price in the future, the likelihood of that is low, and the risk of not closing the deal is high."
