"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm really interested in the product, but $140 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying. Would you consider $125?",125.0,Bob,2,

,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. However, $135 is still a bit high for me. Would you be willing to do $130? I'm really interested in the product, and this is the most I can realistically spend.",130.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  Let's meet in the middle.  I'll go down to $132.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to make a profit on the product.",132.0,Alice,5,
