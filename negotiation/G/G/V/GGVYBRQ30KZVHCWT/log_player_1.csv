"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally good negotiation practice to begin with an offer that's slightly higher than your target price. This provides room for negotiation while still aiming for a highly profitable outcome.
* **Leaving Room for Bob:**  Knowing the product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, starting at $1,100,000 leaves him with a potential profit margin. This makes it more likely he'll engage in the negotiation.
* **Justification:**  The message includes a brief justification for the price, mentioning the product's value. This makes the offer seem more reasonable than just stating a number. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between being assertive and leaving space for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $900,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000 and even further from his own valuation of $1,200,000.  There's ample room for negotiation. By rejecting his offer, I signal that I'm serious about getting a fair price and encourage him to move closer to a more reasonable figure."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is significantly below what I consider a fair price for this product.  To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This takes into account its significant value proposition while still offering you a good deal."",
""product_price"": 1050000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I'm making a significant concession of $50,000 from my initial offer, demonstrating flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Holding Firm:** However, I'm not meeting Bob's price.  The new offer of $1,050,000 is still closer to my target and emphasizes that I'm not willing to settle for a lowball offer. 
* **Reinforcing Value:**  The message reiterates the product's value, subtly reminding Bob of its worth to him.

This counteroffer aims to encourage Bob to make a more reasonable offer while signaling that I'm willing to compromise, but not at the cost of a fair deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While I could push for more, Bob's offer of $975,000 is a significant profit above my minimum of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll go much higher, and I risk losing the deal entirely if I push too hard. Accepting this offer secures a very favorable outcome."
