I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum to see if I can get closer to my desired price."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering the price slightly from my initial offer to see if Bob is willing to meet me halfway."

While $110 is less than what I initially wanted, it's still higher than what Bob initially offered, and I'm closer to my minimum value.  It's better to accept the offer rather than risk losing the sale to John or potentially engaging in further rounds of negotiation."
