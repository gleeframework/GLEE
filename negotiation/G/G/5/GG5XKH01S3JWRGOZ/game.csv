"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,300,000.  It's a valuable asset that you know is worth $1,200,000 to you.  This price reflects its true market value and gives you a slight premium to secure it.  Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $1,000,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects its value to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,000,000 is simply too low for me.  I understand your perspective on value, but I'm confident this product is worth more than that.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $1,150,000?  This is still a fair price for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly.",1150000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. While $1,150,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit high for my budget. How about we settle at $1,075,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",1075000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,075,000 is still quite a bit lower than what I believe this product is worth. To demonstrate my willingness to compromise, I'm willing to drop my price to $1,125,000. This offer is close to your last proposal, and it allows for a fair deal for both of us. Let's work together to close this transaction.",1125000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting close.  I appreciate your willingness to meet me somewhere in the middle. To make this work, I can go up to $1,100,000. This is my final offer, as I'm trying to balance getting this deal done and staying within my budget.",1100000.0,Bob,6,
