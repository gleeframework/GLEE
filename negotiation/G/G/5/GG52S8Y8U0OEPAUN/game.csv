"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. It's a one-of-a-kind opportunity, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $600,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",600000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $600,000 is a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend closer to $500,000.  Would you be willing to consider that?  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.",500000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go as low as $500,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a price of $550,000. This is a great compromise, considering the product's value to you is $800,000. What do you think?",550000.0,Alice,3,
