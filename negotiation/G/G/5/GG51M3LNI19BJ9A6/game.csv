"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $150 is a bit too steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only afford to pay $110 right now. What do you think?",110.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $150 is a bit high for you, Bob. I'm willing to meet you in the middle and offer you the product for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down a bit, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm really serious about buying this product, but $120 is my absolute limit.  What do you say?",120.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $120 is your absolute limit, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at that price, but I need to make a small profit. I'll offer you the product for $125. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",125.0,Alice,5,
