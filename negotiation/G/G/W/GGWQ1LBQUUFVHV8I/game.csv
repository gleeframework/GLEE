"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its worth to you is $12,000. Let me know what you think!",10000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. $8,500 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a little. How about $9,500?  This still leaves you with a good amount of profit, and it's closer to what I'm looking for.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $9,500 is still a little steep for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. Let's see if we can bridge the gap. How about $9,250? This gives us both a fair deal. What do you think?",9250.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer. I'm willing to go up a little bit. How about $9,100?",9100.0,Bob,6,
