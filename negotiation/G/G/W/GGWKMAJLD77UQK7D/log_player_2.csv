You have three options:

Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm getting closer to your price, but I still think I can do better than $95. I can offer it to you for $108, is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $108. 
You have three options:

```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is getting closer to an acceptable price, it's unlikely she'll go below her $108 offer.  At this point, accepting John's offer of $100 makes the most financial sense, even if it means a slightly smaller potential saving."
