"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think.",7500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,400. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested.",8400.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm offering $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",8000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle.",8200.0,Alice,5,
