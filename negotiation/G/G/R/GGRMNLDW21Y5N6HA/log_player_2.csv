"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will meet your needs. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value is worth $8,000 to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is $9,000, which is above your maximum budget of $8,000. It's worthwhile to try to negotiate a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value of the product, $9,000 is a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 7500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $8,400. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,400 is still higher than my maximum budget of $8,000. I'm willing to negotiate further to see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $8,400 is still a bit too high for me. I'm offering $8,000, which is my absolute maximum.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $8,000 is your maximum, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you at $8,200. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you. Let's see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $8,200 is still above my maximum budget of $8,000.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk that the price won't come down further or the deal could fall apart.  Since John is offering the product at my maximum price, it's a better option to buy from him and secure the product immediately."
