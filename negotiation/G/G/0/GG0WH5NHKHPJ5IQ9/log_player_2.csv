"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product.  I think it could really benefit you.  Given its value, I'm asking for $9,500. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
It's always better to try to negotiate, especially since you have 10 rounds.  $9,500 is too high for your target price, and there's a good chance you can get it lower.  Let's see what counteroffer you can make."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product,  $9,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,500 is a bit too low for me to consider. I'm willing to come down to $9,000. This is a fair price considering the value you'll be getting.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $9,000 is closer to your target price, you can still try to negotiate further. You have 7 rounds left, so there's plenty of time to see if you can get Alice to come down a little more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we split the difference and meet at $8,750? I'm genuinely interested in this product, and I believe this price is fair for both of us."", ""product_price"": 8750}
