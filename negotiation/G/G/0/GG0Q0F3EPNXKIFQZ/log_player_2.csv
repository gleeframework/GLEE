You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save money.  $12,000 is over his budget. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $9,000 is a bold move but leaves room for negotiation. It's below his maximum budget, and if Alice accepts, Bob saves a significant amount."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is still a bit over Bob's maximum budget.  It's worth trying to negotiate further and see if Alice is willing to come down a bit more. There's still a chance to save a little more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway. Offering $9,500 is a compromise that still saves him money compared to Alice's previous offer, and it's closer to his ideal price. He's hoping Alice will see the value in reaching a deal quickly."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,000 is now equal to John's price.  Since Bob's goal is to save money, and there's no guarantee that further negotiation will lead to a lower price, it's best to accept Alice's offer.  There's no point in risking further negotiation and possibly losing the deal with Alice."
