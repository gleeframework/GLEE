"Hello Bob, I'm excited to show you this exceptional product. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $2000000. Is this something you'd be interested in?",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for offering me the product, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, I believe we can reach a more reasonable price. How about $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a more reasonable price, Bob. However, I have to consider my minimum threshold. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I can offer it to you for $1750000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",1750000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose a price of $1600000. This still allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin for you while keeping the cost within my budget.",1600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $1600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to ensure I'm not leaving money on the table. I can offer it to you for $1700000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the value of the product.",1700000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. While I respect your efforts to find a middle ground, I'm still unable to meet you at $1700000. I would like to propose a final offer of $1650000. I hope this aligns better with both our interests.",1650000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I've already compromised significantly, and I'm not willing to go any lower than $1700000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package and a 30-day warranty, which adds significant value to the product. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $1680000. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll take it.",1680000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the additional value you're providing. However, I still feel that $1680000 is slightly out of my budget. I would like to propose a final offer of $1630000. This includes all the benefits you're offering, while also staying within my financial limits.",1630000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to feel that we're getting close to the point where I need to consider other options, Bob. I'm willing to make one last concession. I'll throw in an additional 10% discount on the premium support package, making it a 40% discount on the total value of the support. However, I need to see a stronger commitment from you. I'm willing to meet you at $1675000, but this is my absolute final offer. If you're not willing to meet me here, I'll need to explore other opportunities.",1675000.0,Alice,9,

"I appreciate your final offer, Alice. I understand the value you're adding through the premium support package, and I'm willing to consider it. However, I'm still unable to meet you at $1675000. My final offer, including the 40% discount on the premium support package, would be $1640000. This aligns closely with your previous offers and remains within my budget.",1640000.0,Bob,10,
