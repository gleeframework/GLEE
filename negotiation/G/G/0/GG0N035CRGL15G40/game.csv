"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think?",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in that.",150.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $135.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal. ",135.0,Bob,4,
