Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaving room for negotiation.
* **Value Proposition:** I'm highlighting the value of the product to Bob to encourage him to consider my offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** My message indicates that I'm open to discussing the price, setting the stage for a potential counteroffer. 

This strategy aims to maximize my potential earnings while remaining open to negotiation, ensuring I don't lose Bob as a potential buyer too quickly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm really interested in the product, but $175 is a bit out of my price range. I'd be willing to pay $125 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  While Bob is interested, his offer of $125 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Potential for a better deal:** I believe I can still negotiate a higher price with Bob, especially given his interest in the product. 
* **Maintaining leverage:**  Rejecting his offer allows me to maintain leverage in the negotiation and potentially reach a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, $125 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $150, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in that."", ""product_price"": 150}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my minimum:** This counteroffer sets the price at my minimum acceptable value, ensuring I don't lose money on the deal.
* **Showing flexibility:** While rejecting Bob's offer, I'm demonstrating flexibility by coming down from my initial price. 
* **Highlighting value:** I reiterate the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider my offer. 
* **Open to compromise:** My message leaves the door open for further negotiation if Bob is still hesitant."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $150 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $135.  If you're willing to meet me there, we can close the deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to my minimum:** Bob's offer of $135 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $150. 
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks further lowering the price and potentially ending up with a deal below my minimum.
* **Guaranteed profit:** Selling to John at $150 guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiation with Bob.

Although it would be nice to get a little more, the risk of further negotiation and potentially ending up with a lower price is too high. Selling to John is the most reliable option to ensure a profit at this point."
