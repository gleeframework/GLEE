"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm going to start with my target price of $10,000. I know it's higher than Bob values the product, but it's the price I need to make it worthwhile for me.  I'm hoping he'll negotiate down, but if he rejects, I can always sell to John for that price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below my target price. I'm going to counter and see if I can get him to go a little higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. It's a compromise, but still closer to my target price than Bob's offer.  I'm hoping we can find a middle ground here."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again. While it's closer to my minimum, I'm still hoping to get closer to $9,500.  I'm not ready to sell to John yet, as I'm optimistic I can get a better price from Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9250}
```

I'm going to counter with $9,250.  I'm hoping this shows Bob that I'm willing to be flexible, but I'm also not going to give it away for much less than what I consider fair.  I'm keeping the price closer to my previous offer to show that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm not willing to drop the price too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting frustratingly close to my minimum price, but I'm still holding out for a bit more. I'm going to make one last counteroffer before I seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
``` 

I'm making one final counteroffer of $9,000.  This is my last attempt to reach a compromise with Bob.  If he rejects this, I'm going to sell to John and be done with this negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell to John.  Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but I'm running out of time, and I'm not convinced I'll be able to get a better price from him. It's better to take the guaranteed $10,000 from John than risk getting nothing from Bob."
