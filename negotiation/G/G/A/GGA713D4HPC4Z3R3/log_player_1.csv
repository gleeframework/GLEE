Round 4

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
``` 

While I'd prefer to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  It's better to accept this offer than risk losing him and having to sell to John at a slightly lower price."
