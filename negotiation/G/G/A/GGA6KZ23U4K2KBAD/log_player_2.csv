"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential worth to you, I'm proposing an initial price of $1,400,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is quite high, close to your maximum budget and significantly more than her valuation.  There's a good chance you can negotiate a much better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me.  Could we settle on something closer to $1,100,000?"",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

This counteroffer aims to bring the price down significantly closer to Alice's valuation while still leaving room for further negotiation. It presents a starting point that suggests I'm a serious buyer but not willing to overpay."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While I understand your perspective, the value of this product is quite significant.  Could we perhaps agree on $1,300,000? This allows you to benefit greatly while still reflecting the true worth of what's being offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is moving in the right direction, but $1,300,000 is still too high.  I'll counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I'm glad we're getting closer. I can see the value in this product, but I need to be mindful of my budget. How about meeting halfway at $1,200,000?"",
""product_price"": 1200000
}
``` 

This counteroffer makes a reasonable compromise. It shows willingness to move closer to Alice's price while aiming for a price that's still within my desired range."
