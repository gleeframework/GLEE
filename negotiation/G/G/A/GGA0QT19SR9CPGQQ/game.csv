"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let me know your thoughts.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise.",850000.0,Alice,3,
