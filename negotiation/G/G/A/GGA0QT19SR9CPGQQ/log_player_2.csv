"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this unique opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However,  $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects the value we both see in this deal. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Bob. However, $750,000 is a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the value of the product, and I'm confident you'll find it a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is still a better deal for Bob than buying from John for $1,200,000. While Bob could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will walk away, forcing Bob to buy from John at a much higher price.  Accepting the offer secures a good deal for Bob."
