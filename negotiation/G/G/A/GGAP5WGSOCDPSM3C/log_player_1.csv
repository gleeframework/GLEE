Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'll reject Bob's offer. While $9,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still try to get closer to my ideal price by counter-offering."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}

I'm offering $9,500, which is a slight increase from Bob's offer. This shows that I'm willing to negotiate, but I still want to get as close to my desired price as possible."

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum.  While I'd like to get a little more, I'm satisfied with the current offer and don't want to risk losing the sale by continuing to negotiate."
