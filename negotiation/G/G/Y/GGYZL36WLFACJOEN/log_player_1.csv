Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $95. It's a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** $95 is more than your minimum acceptable price of $80.
* **It's below Bob's maximum:** $95 is less than the value Bob places on the product, $100. 
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  There's enough space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing you to potentially reach a mutually beneficial price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $70? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $70. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $70
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $70 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable price of $80. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you making an offer, but $70 is just too low for me. How about we split the difference at $85? That's still a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 85}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand it's a good product Alice, but I'm on a tight budget. How about $78? That's a fair price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $78 is closer to my minimum, it's still not ideal.  I'd rather sell to John for $80 and avoid further negotiation.  It's quicker and guarantees a solid profit."
