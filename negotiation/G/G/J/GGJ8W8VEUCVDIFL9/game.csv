"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this amazing product. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great price, considering the value it will bring to your life.",9000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate you considering my needs, but $9,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $8,500 is a bit below my target price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of offering the product to you for $8,800. This is a compromise that I believe is fair, considering the value the product will bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8800.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $8,800 is still a little too high for me.  How about $8,200?  That's a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal.",8200.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $8,200. I'm willing to make another concession, and I'll offer the product to you for $8,600. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your life. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",8600.0,Alice,5,
