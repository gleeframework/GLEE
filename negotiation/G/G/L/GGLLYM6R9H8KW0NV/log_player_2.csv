{""product_price"": 1050000}
```

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Although Alice's offer is getting closer to John's price, it's still higher. Bob has already shown a willingness to pay more than John, and with only a few rounds left, he might be able to get a better price from Alice. It's worth trying to negotiate further, as there's still a chance to secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1035000}
```

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

With only a few rounds left, Bob is running out of time to get a better price from Alice. Alice's offer is higher than John's price and hasn't shown much willingness to budge. At this point, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy from John and secure the product for a guaranteed price.  There's a risk of not getting a deal with Alice at all if the negotiations stall.  This also preserves Bob's resources for potential future deals with other sellers."
