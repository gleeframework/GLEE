"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $5,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",5000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thanks for coming down, Alice, I appreciate the effort. However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair offer considering market value.",6500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?  That's a firm offer from my side.",7500.0,Bob,6,
