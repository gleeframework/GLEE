"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll love it! I'm willing to sell it to you for $18,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's starting offer is way above your maximum price. It's clear there's room for negotiation. You'll reject this offer and propose something much lower."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is way beyond my budget for this product. I'd be willing to pay $5,000.  Let me know if that works for you."",
""product_price"": 5000
}
``` 

This counter-offer is a starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's asking price, but it leaves space for negotiation. The message is polite and explains that the initial offer was unrealistic for your budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $5,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can do $12,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice came down significantly from her initial offer, but $12,000 is still too high. You know you have the option to buy from John for $8,000. You need to push Alice closer to your budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for coming down, Alice, I appreciate the effort. However, $12,000 is still a bit of a stretch for me. Would you consider $6,500? I think that's a fair offer considering market value."",
""product_price"": 6500
}
``` 

This counter-offer aims to keep the negotiation moving while inching closer to a price you find acceptable. By mentioning ""market value,"" you subtly imply that you've researched the product's worth, strengthening your position."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $6,500 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can do $9,000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and my costs. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice is getting closer, but $9,000 is still above your backup plan with John. You'll reject this offer and see if you can negotiate a price closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice.  However, $9,000 is still a bit higher than I'd like to spend.  Would you be willing to settle at $7,500?  That's a firm offer from my side."",
""product_price"": 7500
}
``` 

This message does a few things:

* **Expresses Gratitude:**  Acknowledging Alice's movement keeps the tone positive.
* **Firm but Fair:**  Stating $7,500 as a ""firm offer"" signals that you're serious and unlikely to budge much higher. 
* **Close to Goal:**  This price is very close to your $8,000 fallback with John, putting pressure on Alice to decide."
