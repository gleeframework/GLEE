"Bob, I have a product that I believe you'd find very valuable. It's worth at least $10,000 to me, and I know it holds significant value for you as well. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This price is slightly above my minimum but reflects the potential benefit you'll gain from owning it.  Let me know if you're interested!",10500.0,Alice,1,
