"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this great product at a competitive price. I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $180. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $180
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

Alice's offer is significantly higher than both your maximum price and what John is offering. You should definitely counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. How about we settle on something around [Price in the $60-$75 range]?"", ""product_price"": 70} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:**  We're aiming to get the product well below Alice's valuation. Starting significantly lower gives us room to negotiate upwards. 
* **Appearing Reasonable:** We don't want to start so low (like $20) that Alice walks away. Offering in the $60-$75 range shows we're serious but looking for a good deal.
* **Leaving Room to Negotiate:**  We expect Alice to counter, and this offer gives us space to gradually increase our bid if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price between $100 and $120? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $110 is closer to your maximum price, it's still higher than what John offers. You've successfully moved Alice down from her initial price, indicating there might be wiggle room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  $110 is getting closer, but I'm on a tight budget.  Would you consider $90?  That's a fair deal, and we can wrap this up today."", ""product_price"": 90}

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** We're aiming for a price between her last offer ($110) and our previous offer ($70). Splitting the difference can signal a willingness to compromise.
* **Urgency and Closure:** By mentioning wrapping the deal up ""today,"" we subtly imply that we might go with John's offer if a deal isn't reached soon.
* **Staying Below John's Price:**  We're still aiming to pay less than John's offer, maximizing our potential savings."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I can do $100, but that's as low as I can go. It's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice has met your best alternative price.  There's no point in negotiating further as you won't get a lower price from Alice and John is offering the same amount. Take the deal!"
