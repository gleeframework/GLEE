"I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I'm looking to stay within a tighter budget. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this price is still a fair reflection of its value, considering the market and my business needs.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $900,000 is closer to my expectation, it's still a bit below the product's true worth. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price reflects a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's fair considering the value this product brings to your business.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product and the market price.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your financial constraints, but $975,000 is still not quite meeting my needs. However, I'm willing to make a final concession. I'm offering the product for $1,000,000. This price is my absolute bottom line, considering the product's unique value and my own expenses.  I believe this is a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand that you've made a significant concession, but $1,000,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to make a final offer of $925,000 for the product. I believe this price is a fair compromise, considering the value I'll get from the product and the market price. If this offer is not accepted, I will seriously consider purchasing the product from John for $800,000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
