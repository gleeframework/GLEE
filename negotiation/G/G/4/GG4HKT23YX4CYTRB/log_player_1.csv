Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $135. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $120 (John), you can afford to start with a higher offer to Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $135 represents a 12.5% markup, which isn't unreasonable and leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate if he wants.
* **Limited Time Offer:** Creating a sense of urgency might encourage Bob to act quickly and accept the offer. 

**Important:** This is just one strategy.  You could experiment with different starting prices and observe Bob's responses in a real-world scenario to optimize your profit."
