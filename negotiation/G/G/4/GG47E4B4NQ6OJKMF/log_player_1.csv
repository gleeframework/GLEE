Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $180. This gives me a good margin, but it's still reasonable given the value to Bob.  I'm confident that Bob will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $135 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $150. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 145}
```

I'm lowering my price to $145. This is still a good price for me, and it shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate. I'm hoping he'll accept this offer, but I'm prepared to continue negotiating if necessary."
