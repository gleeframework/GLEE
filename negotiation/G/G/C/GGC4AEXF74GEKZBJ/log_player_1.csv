Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will be a wise investment for you. I'm willing to part with it for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, so please let me know your decision soon."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if you can get more from Bob.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000. Offering it for less than that would be leaving money on the table.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $1,400,000 leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still being a significant profit above your minimum.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between getting the highest possible price from Bob and ensuring the sale goes through, avoiding the risk of him rejecting the offer."
