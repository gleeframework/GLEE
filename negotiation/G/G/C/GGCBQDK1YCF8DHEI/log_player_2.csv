"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I'm excited to present our premium product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity tailored specifically to meet your needs and expectations. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than its face value. Considering its true worth, I am offering it to you for $14,000. This price reflects its high quality, unique features, and the benefits it will bring to you. I trust this offer will be mutually beneficial and look forward to your positive response. If you have any questions or need further details, please don't hesitate to reach out. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's flowery language tries to emphasize the product's value, you have a firm budget of $15,000 and know John will sell it for that price. By rejecting Alice's offer, you open the possibility of negotiating a lower price. She might be willing to come down closer to her $10,000 valuation to make a sale."
