"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. Let's see if we can find some common ground.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $2,000,000 represents the high end of its value, I can't accept $1,200,000.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,750,000?",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,750,000 is still outside my comfort zone.  How about we compromise at $1,400,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us and allow us to close the deal.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
