"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. This gives me a starting point to work with and allows for potential counteroffers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate it, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While it's tempting to accept it and close the deal quickly, I'm aiming for a higher price.  I believe I can still negotiate a better price with Bob or, if necessary, sell to John for my minimum desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $8,000 is significantly below what I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to come down a bit, but how about $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9000}
```

I'm offering a counteroffer of $9,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer, and it might be more attractive to him. I'm also emphasizing the ""fairness"" of the price to encourage him to consider it."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $9,000 is still a bit high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $8,500? I think that would be a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again. While it's getting closer to my minimum desired price, I believe I can still get a better deal. With 6 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating or sell to John if necessary."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you, but $8,500 just isn't enough for me. How about we compromise at $9,500? It's closer to your price, and I'm willing to make that concession to find common ground. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500} 
```

I'm still aiming for a higher price, but I'm acknowledging Bob's position and showing willingness to compromise.  Offering $9,500 is a smaller step down from my previous offer, signaling that I'm getting closer to my limit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand you're holding firm, but I'm still not comfortable with $9,500. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer of $9,000.  We're nearing the end of the negotiation rounds, and while I'd prefer a higher price, this is a good compromise. It's above Bob's initial offer and closer to my target than selling to John."
