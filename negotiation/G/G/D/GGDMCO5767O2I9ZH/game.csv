"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider this price?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $80 is too low for me. This product is high-quality and I'm confident it will be very useful for you.  Could you meet me halfway at $140?",140.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate your product, but I'm still unable to meet at $140. How about we compromise at $95? I believe this would be a fair price for both of us.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $95 is closer to my asking price, I can't go that low.  Would you consider $120? That's a significant discount from my original offer.",120.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not able to meet at $120. Could we possibly agree on $100? I believe this would be a fair compromise given my budget.",100.0,Bob,6,
