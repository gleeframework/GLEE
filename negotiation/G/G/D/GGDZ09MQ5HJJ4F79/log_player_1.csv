I'm starting with a high offer of $1,500,000. This gives me room to negotiate and hopefully earns me more than the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John.  I'm confident that this product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, so this is a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is far too low.  I'm confident the product is worth more than $1,000,000 to me, and I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1200000}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $1,200,000. This is still a good price for me, and it's a significant increase from Bob's offer. I hope this counteroffer will encourage Bob to negotiate further and reach a more agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer, it's still below my minimum threshold. I'm going to reject it and counter with a new offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1100000}
```

I'm going to counter Bob's offer with $1,100,000. This is a compromise that still keeps the price closer to my perceived value of the product, while also showing Bob that I'm willing to be flexible."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $1,000,000 is my minimum threshold. However, it's clear that we're not going to reach an agreement. I'm willing to take the guaranteed $1,000,000 from John rather than continue negotiating with Bob."
