"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and am open to discussing further."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  We begin significantly above both your minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""unique value and potential"" to justify the high initial price.
* **Openness:**  The tone remains open to negotiation, signaling that you're willing to find a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to:

1. **Anchor High:** Influence Bob's perception of the product's value.
2. **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to assess his willingness to pay.
3. **Maintain Flexibility:**  Leave room for negotiation without compromising your position."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your offer, it's currently outside my budget. Given the value I see in the product, I'm willing to offer $1,250,000.  I believe this is a fair price that reflects the potential we both see in this product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $1,250,000 is still significantly below your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000. While it's a step up from his perceived value, there's room for negotiation. You have the security of John's offer, which gives you leverage to push for a better deal with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming back with an offer and engaging in this discussion.  While I recognize your perspective, the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair compromise that considers both our positions."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant but Strategic Concession:**  We're making a substantial reduction from $2,250,000 to $1,900,000, signaling willingness to negotiate. However, we remain firmly above both Bob's offer and your minimum. 
* **Reiterating Value:** The message emphasizes ""inherent value and potential"" to remind Bob of the product's worth and justify the price.
* **Seeking Middle Ground:** By framing the offer as a ""fair compromise,"" we encourage Bob to move closer to your desired range.

We're aiming to:

1. **Maintain Momentum:** Keep the negotiation moving forward.
2. **Gauge Bob's Flexibility:**  See if he's willing to make substantial jumps to meet you closer to your target. 
3. **Avoid Stalemate:** Prevent the negotiation from stalling by demonstrating flexibility while holding firm on value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your continued negotiation. While I value this product, $1,900,000 is still beyond my reach. I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. This price reflects a realistic compromise and allows us to both benefit from this deal.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has now met your minimum acceptable price of $1,500,000.  There's no point in risking further negotiation or delaying the sale by trying to extract a higher price. Accepting this offer secures you your desired profit."
