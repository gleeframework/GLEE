Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly special."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Leveraging Value:**  We know the product is worth $800,000 to both Alice and Bob. This means there's room for negotiation above that price.
* **First Offer Anchor:**  By starting with a higher offer ($950,000), Alice sets a strong anchor point. Even if Bob negotiates down, Alice is likely to secure a price significantly higher than $800,000. 
* **Backup Plan:**  Alice has the security of John as a buyer at $800,000. This means she can afford to be firm in her negotiations with Bob.

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes Alice has some time for negotiation. If she needs to sell quickly, a price closer to $800,000 might be more suitable."
