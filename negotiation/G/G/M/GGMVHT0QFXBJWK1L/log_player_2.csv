Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is your maximum budget, but I'm still looking to get a better price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $1000000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise considering the value the product offers.

Bob should buy the product from John.  Alice's offer of $1,000,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's not enough for Bob to accept. John is offering a price that is within Bob's budget, making him the better option."
