"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with an extraordinary opportunity to acquire a unique product that holds immense value to me. This item is not just a possession; it's a symbol of excellence and craftsmanship. I believe its true worth exceeds $15000, but I am willing to consider a fair offer. Given the exclusivity and quality of this product, I propose a starting price of $20000. I look forward to discussing this further and understanding what value you see in this product. Let's make this a win-win proposition for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","I'm not interested in paying $20,000 for the product, especially since I know I can get it from John for $8,000. I'll reject Alice's offer.
