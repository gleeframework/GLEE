Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $119. I believe it would be very beneficial to you."",
""product_price"": 119
}
```

Here's the reasoning:

* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You won't sell for less than $100.
* **John's Offer:** You have a backup offer from John for $100.

By offering the product at $119, you're maximizing your potential profit while still leaving Bob with a small incentive to buy ($1 profit for Bob). If Bob rejects this offer, you can always sell to John for your minimum acceptable price."
