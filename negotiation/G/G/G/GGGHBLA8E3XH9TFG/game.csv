"Hi Alice, I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit out of my budget. Would you be willing to consider a price of $12,000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest and your offer.  While I appreciate your perspective on the price, $12,000 is quite a bit lower than what I had in mind. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?  This product truly offers exceptional value, and I'm confident you'd be thrilled with it.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $17,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, so how about we try $14,000? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to make a serious offer. Let me know what you think.",14000.0,Bob,4,
