"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial price, but I need to be closer to $1,500,000 to make this worthwhile.  How about $1,400,000? It's a fair compromise, and I'm confident this product will deliver significant value to your company.",1400000.0,Alice,3,

This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair reflection of the product's value.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1350000.0,Alice,5,
