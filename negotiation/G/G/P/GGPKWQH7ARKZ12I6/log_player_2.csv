Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11,500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $11,000 for the product. This is a fair price that reflects both our needs, and I hope we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns, Bob, and I'm willing to make another compromise. However, I'm not willing to go below $11,200. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob is getting closer to his budget, and while $11,200 is a bit higher than his ideal price, it's still within his acceptable range.  He's likely to be able to buy the product from John for $10,000, but at this point, he's likely to get a better deal by accepting Alice's offer. Continuing to negotiate might not lead to a significantly lower price, and Bob risks losing the opportunity to buy from Alice."
