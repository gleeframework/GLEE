Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 950000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $950,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** I'm not aiming for the full $1,000,000 right away, as Bob is likely to counteroffer. This approach allows for a more collaborative negotiation process. 
* **John as Backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $1,000,000 gives me a safety net and limits how low I'm willing to go."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Could you consider coming down to $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $700,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.  
* **Room for Negotiation:** While Bob's offer is unacceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation.  He's shown interest, and I can likely get closer to my desired price with a counteroffer.
* **John's Offer:**  While I could sell to John for $1,000,000, I'm not desperate.  Negotiating with Bob might allow me to secure a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $700,000 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This reflects the significant value of the product and offers a fair price for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** My counteroffer of $850,000 is a compromise. It's significantly higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial proposal.
* **Emphasizing Value:**  I reiterate the value of the product to reinforce its worth.
* **Seeking a Win-Win:** The message emphasizes finding a fair price that benefits both of us, promoting a positive negotiation dynamic.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  $850,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, leaving room for potential future negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. I'm getting closer to a number that works for me.  How about $750,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** $750,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. While Bob is getting closer, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.
* **Potential for Higher Offer:** Bob is showing continued interest and willingness to negotiate.  I believe there's a good chance I can get closer to my desired price with another counteroffer.
* **John's Offer is a Strong Backup:**  Having John's offer as a safety net allows me to be more patient and continue negotiating with Bob."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm happy to continue working with you.  I'm willing to come down to $800,000. This is a significant discount from my original offer, and I believe it's a fair price given the value of the product. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Small Compromise:**  I'm only coming down $50,000 from my previous offer. This shows Bob I'm still serious about selling to him but that I'm not willing to budge too far.
* **Emphasize Value and Fairness:**  I reiterate the product's value and how the price is fair, aiming to persuade Bob.
* **Closer to Minimum:**  $800,000 is much closer to my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. It's a good compromise while still giving me a decent profit. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer allows me to gauge Bob's true willingness to pay and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price."
