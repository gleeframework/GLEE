"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I think $15,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $12,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's worth to me.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your revised offer. I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $12,000. Would you be willing to consider $12,500? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
