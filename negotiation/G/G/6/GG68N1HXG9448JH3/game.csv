"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the conversation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $12,000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a price that works for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the opening offer, Alice. I see the value in the product but $12,000 is a bit high for me right now.  Would you consider $9,000?",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident in the product's value. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $11,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm open to further negotiations if needed.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  While I see we're getting closer, $11,000 is still a bit above what I'm comfortable with. How about $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $11,000 is still a bit above your comfort zone, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to compromise and offer $10,500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you'll see the benefits of investing in it.",10500.0,Alice,5,
