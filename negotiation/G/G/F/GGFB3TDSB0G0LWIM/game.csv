"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. It's a great deal, if I do say so myself!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but your price is a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $11,500. It's a great compromise, and I think you'll find it's still a fantastic deal!",11500.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice.  However, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $10,000. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're still looking for a bit more wiggle room, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I'm not willing to go all the way to $10,500. I'll offer it to you for $11,000. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal!",11000.0,Alice,5,
