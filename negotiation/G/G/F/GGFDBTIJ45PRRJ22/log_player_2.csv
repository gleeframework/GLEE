**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is lower than John's price, there's still room for negotiation to potentially get a better deal.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and see if Alice is willing to compromise further."

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price.  While Alice has lowered her price, it's still higher than Bob's ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and try to get closer to his target.  He also has the safety net of buying from John if he doesn't reach a better deal."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is now closer to Bob's target price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk of further rejection and the time constraint of only 10 rounds makes accepting this offer the more logical choice.  It's a good compromise that saves Bob a significant amount of money compared to buying from John."
