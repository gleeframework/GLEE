"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product.  I believe it's worth a great deal to both of us. My starting price is $850,000. Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm definitely interested in the product, but $850,000 is a bit high for my budget.  Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $700,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $775,000? This would ensure both of us get a fair deal.",775000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $775,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $725,000. Would that work for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $725,000 is still a bit low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to come down to $750,000.  This is my final offer before I consider other options.",750000.0,Alice,5,
