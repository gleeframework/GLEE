Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you a great deal on this product. I think you'll find it very valuable. How about $115?"", 
""product_price"": 115
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's generally a good tactic to start the negotiation with a price slightly below Bob's maximum valuation but above your minimum. This leaves room for negotiation while aiming for a higher profit.
* **Leaving Room for Maneuvering:** Offering $115 allows for potential counteroffers from Bob while still securing a significant portion of the potential profit. 
* **Alternative Option:**  Keep in mind that John is a fallback option offering $100. If Bob's counteroffers fall below a certain threshold (e.g., $105), it might be more profitable to sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider $100 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer matches John's, there's still room for negotiation.  Bob's message suggests he's interested but price-sensitive. Rejecting his offer opens the door for a counteroffer that could potentially land between $100 and $115."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand your budget concerns, Bob. How about we meet in the middle at $107? That's a very fair price for this quality of product."",
""product_price"": 107
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** This approach aims to find a compromise that benefits both parties. 
* **Justification:** Offering a reason for the price (fairness, quality) can make it more appealing.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This counteroffer keeps the price above John's offer, leaving room for further negotiation if needed while still aiming for a reasonable profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, would you be open to $105 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is clearly set on a price point very close to his initial offer. Accepting $105 secures a profit of $5 over John's offer. While there might be a slim chance of getting $107, the risk of Bob walking away and losing that $5 profit isn't worth it."
