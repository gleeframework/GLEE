"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for sale. I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a deal. I'm offering it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $120 from John.  Alice's offer is $100, which is better than John's price, but still above Bob's maximum value of $120.  Therefore, Bob should reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm really interested in the product, but $100 is a bit above my budget.  Would you be willing to come down to $90?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $100 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $95. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $95 is still within Bob's budget of $120. While Bob could try to negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting his offer and potentially making a higher counteroffer or walking away from the deal is high. Accepting Alice's offer at $95 is the best course of action, as it secures the product for a price that is still within Bob's budget and saves him $25 compared to buying from John."
