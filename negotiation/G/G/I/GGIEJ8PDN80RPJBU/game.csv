"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. Would you like to purchase it for $200?",200.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $200 is a bit steep for me.  I'm interested in your product but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think.",125.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $200 is a bit steep, but I'm not willing to go as low as $125. I can offer you a compromise at $175. This is my best price, and I'm confident you'll find it reasonable.",175.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate the compromise, but $175 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $150, which is my absolute maximum. Let me know if you're willing to accept that.",150.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to get the best deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $150. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $175 was too high, but $162.50 is a more reasonable compromise. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",162.5,Alice,5,
