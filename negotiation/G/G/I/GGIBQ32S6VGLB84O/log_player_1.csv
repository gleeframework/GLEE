"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really love it. I'm asking for $130 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 130} 
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than the product's worth to me, leaving room for negotiation. I'm also trying to build rapport with Bob by expressing confidence in the product and appealing to his potential enjoyment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is below my minimum price, but I'm willing to negotiate further. I'm not ready to sell to John yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for your interest, Bob!  I appreciate the offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference at $120? That's a fair price for both of us, and I know you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $120. Can you consider going down to $115? That's the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to continue negotiating, but I'm also aware that I can sell to John for a guaranteed $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. But $115 is still a bit too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $117.50?  It's only a small difference from your last offer, and it would be a fair compromise."", ""product_price"": 117.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with $117.50. Can you consider going down to $116? That's the best I can do. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $116. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $116
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've already had several rounds of negotiation and it seems we're not going to come to an agreement. With only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly risky to keep negotiating with Bob.  It's time to take the guaranteed $120 from John."
