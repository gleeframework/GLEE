"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. Would you be willing to meet me in the middle?",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $105 is a bit too low for me. How about $110? That's still a good deal for you, as you mentioned the product is worth $120 to you.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your revised offer, but I'm still a bit hesitant. How about we meet in the middle at $107.50? That's the best I can do.",107.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $107.50 is still a bit too low for me.  How about $109?  That's a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",109.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm still not comfortable with $109. I'm willing to go up to $108, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",108.0,Bob,6,
