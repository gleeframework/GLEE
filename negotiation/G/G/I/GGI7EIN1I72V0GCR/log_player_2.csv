"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'd like to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product at a competitive price. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:** Even though Bob could buy from John for $1,000,000, Alice's offer of $950,000 saves Bob $50,000.
* **It's still within Bob's budget:** The product is worth $1,000,000 to Bob, and Alice's offer is below that. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial choice for Bob."
