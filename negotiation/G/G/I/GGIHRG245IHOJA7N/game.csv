"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and leaves room for both of us to walk away satisfied. Let's work towards a mutually beneficial agreement.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $800,000, which is the price I was initially offered by John.
