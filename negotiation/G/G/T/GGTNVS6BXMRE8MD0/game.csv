"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'm not sure I can go any higher than that.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I understand your position, but $8,500 is still a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,250? This way, we both get a fair deal. Let me know what you think.",9250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your perspective, but $9,250 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $9,000. I think that's a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  $9,000 is getting closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target.  How about we split the difference again and go with $9,125? I think that's a fair compromise that would make us both happy.",9125.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your persistence, but $9,125 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I can only go up to $8,750. I think that's the best compromise we can reach.",8750.0,Bob,6,
