"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth more than $80 to us, but I'm open to discussing a fair price. Let's aim for a value that benefits both of us. How about we start at $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $95 is a good starting point, Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to start negotiating and potentially secure a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being open to negotiation.  $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.  I'm willing to pay $85 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows Bob is willing to negotiate but also signals he's serious about getting a good deal. Starting at $85 sets the stage for a back-and-forth negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. Let's try to find a middle ground. How does $90 sound as a price for our premium product? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $90 is closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer keeps the negotiation going and allows Bob to try and secure a price closer to his target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible. $90 is still a bit high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $85. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm on his previous offer of $85. This shows Alice he is serious about getting a good deal and is not willing to budge much further. It also sets the stage for a potential compromise in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Considering our previous discussions, I believe $88 would be a fair price for both of us. This allows for a slight increase from your last offer while still maintaining a reasonable profit margin for us. What do you think, Bob? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $88. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $88
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $88, which is only $3 more than Bob's last offer. This is a good deal for Bob, considering he is willing to pay up to $100 from John. Accepting the offer saves him $12 compared to buying from John."
