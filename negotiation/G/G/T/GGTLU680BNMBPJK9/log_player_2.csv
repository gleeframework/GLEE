Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $800000 is simply too far below the product's true worth.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to come down to $1750000. This represents a significant reduction from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's potential. Let's see if we can find common ground.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your financial limitations, but $1000000 is unfortunately still far below the product's true value. To demonstrate my commitment to finding a solution, I'm willing to lower my price one last time to $1300000.  This is the absolute lowest I can go while still ensuring a reasonable return on my investment. This is my final offer, and I urge you to consider it carefully.  If you are unable to meet this price, I'll have to pursue other options.
