Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While the product's value to me is considerably higher, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we meet at $1,550,000? This reflects the product's significant worth while acknowledging your interest.

{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,550,000 is still too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I'm not comfortable going any higher.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. I understand your perspective on the price, but the product's value is truly significant. Let's settle this at $1,425,000. This offer represents a fair compromise, don't you think?

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice has come down a bit, the offer is still above your maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's clear that the negotiations are getting more difficult and you may not be able to get Alice to come down to a price you're comfortable with.  It's better to cut your losses and buy the product from John for $1,000,000, as that price is within your budget and avoids any further negotiation headaches."
