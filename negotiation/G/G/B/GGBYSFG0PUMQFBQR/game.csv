"I'm very interested in the product, but $2,300,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from the product.",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your offer. It demonstrates a serious commitment to acquiring the product.  While $1,800,000 is a respectable figure, the true value of this product, in terms of potential and long-term returns, is significantly higher. I'm willing to come down to $2,100,000.  I believe this revised price point represents a fair compromise.",2100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate Alice's willingness to negotiate, but I still think $2,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet in the middle and pay $1,900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering the value I'll get from it.",1900000.0,Bob,4,
