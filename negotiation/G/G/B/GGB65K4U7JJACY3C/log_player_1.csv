Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $175, knowing the product is worth at least $150 to me and $100 to Bob. This leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive message:** I'm using a friendly and positive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Focus on value:** I'm highlighting the product's value to Bob, hoping to pique his interest. 

**Next steps:**

* I'll be prepared to negotiate if Bob makes a counteroffer. 
* I'll keep the option of selling to John for $150 in mind if the negotiations with Bob don't lead to a satisfactory price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am only able to pay up to $150 for it. Would you consider accepting this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** Bob's offer of $150 is my absolute minimum acceptable price.  
* **No need to risk further negotiation:**  There's no guarantee I can get more from Bob.  
* **John's offer is the same:** Selling to John also yields $150, but this option involves no further negotiation.

**Conclusion:**  I'll accept Bob's offer to ensure a quick and certain sale at my minimum price."
