"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss selling this product to you. I think it could really benefit your business. Given its immense value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,100,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for negotiation.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $1,100,000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value it holds for me.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value and potential.  I'm willing to be flexible, but I need to see a price that reflects its worth.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product. However, I'm still constrained by my budget. I'm willing to go up to $900,000, but that's my absolute limit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm trying to find a fair compromise here. $900,000 is still quite a bit lower than I'd like, but I understand your budget constraints.  Would you consider meeting halfway between our last two offers at $950,000? This demonstrates my willingness to make a deal while still reflecting the product's worth.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $950,000 is still beyond my limit. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value I see in the product.",900000.0,Bob,6,
