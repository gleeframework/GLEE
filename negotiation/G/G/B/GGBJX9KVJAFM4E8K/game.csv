"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. Given its unique value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000.  I'm confident this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in the product, $1,150,000 is outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it, which is still a fair price considering its value to you. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at this price.",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I understand your perspective, the product's value is significantly higher than your offer.  To move things forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000. This reflects the true worth of what I'm offering.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $1,100,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,050,000. This would be a fair compromise and would allow us to finalize the deal.  Remember, I have another option available, so I need to be certain this is the right price for me.",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. To be completely transparent, my absolute lowest price for this product is $1,080,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, considering its true worth. Let me know if you're ready to close the deal at this price.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position and appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,080,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. To finalize this deal, I'm willing to pay $1,060,000. This is a fair compromise that gives us both a good outcome. If this price doesn't work for you, I'll need to consider my other options.",1060000.0,Bob,6,
