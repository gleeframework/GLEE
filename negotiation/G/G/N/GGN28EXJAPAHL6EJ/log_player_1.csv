Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I have a great product that I think you'll really like. I'm willing to offer it to you for $15,000. This is a very competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a deal like this elsewhere."", ""product_price"": 15000}"

Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 4
Bob's offer:

Round 6
