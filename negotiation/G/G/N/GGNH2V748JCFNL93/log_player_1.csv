Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than my minimum, but still hopefully within the realm of what Bob might be willing to pay. This allows me to gauge his interest and potentially negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $12,000 is more than my minimum, I'm confident I can get a higher price by continuing to negotiate.  I want to see if I can push for something closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500}
```

I'm going to counter with $13,500. This is a compromise, but still a good price for me, and it signals that I'm willing to be flexible.  Hopefully Bob will see this as a fair price and accept."

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a higher price, $12,500 is still a good amount and it avoids further negotiation, which might lead to a lower price or even a rejection by Bob.  Selling to John for $10,000 is less profitable, so accepting Bob's offer is the better choice."
