"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this unique product. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high:** While it's a good starting point, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000. 
* **Opportunity for negotiation:** There's room to negotiate and potentially get a better price. 
* **Avoiding John's offer:**  It's better to explore negotiation with Alice first to potentially save more money than buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive Counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial price, demonstrating your intention to negotiate aggressively.
* **Within Budget:**  $950,000 is still within your budget, leaving room for potential concessions.
* **Reasoning Provided:**  The message justifies your counteroffer by acknowledging the value of the product but emphasizing your budget constraints."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit, so I'm offering it to you for $1,050,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still high:** While it's lower than the initial offer, it's still above your ideal price point and leaves little room for further negotiation.
* **Opportunity to push for a better deal:** You can still try to lower the price further, potentially getting closer to your target of $950,000.
* **Avoiding John's offer:** It's still worthwhile to continue negotiating with Alice, as buying from John is a last resort."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. While $1,050,000 is closer, I'm still a bit stretched.  I'm happy to offer $1,000,000 for the product, which is a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Alice's Value:**  Offering $1,000,000 is right at Alice's minimum acceptable price.
* **Demonstrates Willingness to Compromise:** The message shows that you're willing to meet her halfway.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is positive and emphasizes reaching a deal, creating a sense of urgency."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium support package worth $20,000, which is a $10,000 value. This way, you'll get the product for $1,030,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,030,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,030,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Good Deal:**  The offer of $1,030,000 with the added value of the support package is a good deal, considering your budget of $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation Exhausted:** Alice has shown a firm stance at $1,050,000, and you've already countered with a lower offer.  Further negotiation might be unproductive.
* **Avoiding John's Price:** This deal is significantly better than buying from John at $1,200,000.

While you could continue to push for a lower price, accepting this offer is the most logical decision.  You're getting the product for a lower price than John's offer and gaining additional value with the support package."
