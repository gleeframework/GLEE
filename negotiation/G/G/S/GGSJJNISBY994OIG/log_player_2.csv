"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. $12,000 is still too high for him, and he has 9 more rounds to try and negotiate a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows him to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer Alice!  I'm interested, but $12,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $9,000?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand that $12,000 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer it to you for $11,000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming for a lower price, and $11,000 is still above his ideal range. He has 7 more rounds to try and negotiate further. Rejecting the offer allows him to make another counteroffer and potentially reach a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me.  How about $10,000?  This feels like a fair compromise, and it's a price I'm comfortable with."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $11,000 might still be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to make another concession. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Price is getting close:** Alice is now offering $10,500, which is very close to Bob's ideal price of $10,000.
* **Risk of losing the deal:**  Bob has only 5 rounds left.  If he keeps rejecting offers, he risks Alice getting frustrated or the deal falling apart.  
* **Alternative is expensive:** Buying from John for $15,000 is significantly more expensive than Alice's current offer.

While Bob could try to squeeze out another $500, the risk of losing the deal or having to pay John a much higher price outweighs the potential savings. Accepting the offer at this point is the most pragmatic decision."
