"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a fantastic opportunity for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let's get this deal done! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is too high.**  You're willing to pay up to $1,200,000, but Alice is asking for $1,000,000.  
* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get a better price.
* **John's offer is a fallback option.**  You can always buy from John if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,000,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's find a middle ground and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but fair opening counteroffer:** This counteroffer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but it's still within your budget and leaves room for further negotiation. 
* **Provides a reason:**  You give a clear reason for your counteroffer, showing that you're willing to negotiate.
* **Focuses on finding a middle ground:** This phrasing suggests a collaborative approach, making Alice more likely to consider your offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good price, but $850000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair return on my investment. I'm happy to sell the product for $950000.  Let's find a middle ground and get this deal done. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is still too high.** While she has moved closer to your desired price, $950,000 is still above what you want to pay.
* **There's still room for negotiation.**  You can likely get Alice to lower her price further.
* **John's offer is a safety net.** You have a backup option if negotiations with Alice fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $950,000 is still higher than I'm comfortable with. Given your price point, I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moderate counteroffer:** This counteroffer is a smaller step than the previous one, showing a willingness to compromise while still pushing for a better price.
* **Focus on fairness:** You emphasize that the price is ""fair for both of us"" to encourage a collaborative approach.
* **Express confidence:** Stating that you're ""confident we can close this deal"" conveys optimism and reinforces your desire to reach an agreement."
