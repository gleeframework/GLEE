Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to pay $80 for it. Can you meet me halfway?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the product is high quality and in high demand, but $120 is still a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you consider my offer?

While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, his offers are incrementing quite slowly. It's unlikely he'll reach a price that's significantly better than what John is offering.  Selling to John ensures a guaranteed $100 profit without further negotiation."
