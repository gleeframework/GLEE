"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this product.  Given its unique value, I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously high):** We start significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) and your minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows you to gauge Bob's interest and potential counter-offer.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's ""unique value"" to justify the high initial price without revealing your hand entirely. 
* **Leaving John as Leverage:**  The option to sell to John for your minimum acceptable price provides a safety net. We don't mention John yet, as it's better to explore Bob's willingness to pay first."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Still Below Your Minimum:** While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to your $1,500,000 minimum, it's still significantly lower. Accepting now would leave a lot of potential profit on the table. 
* **Room for Negotiation:** We are only in Round 2 of 10.  There's plenty of time to negotiate and try to bring Bob closer to your desired price range.
* **John Provides Leverage (But We Don't Use Him Yet):**  Having John as a backup buyer gives you the confidence to push for a better deal with Bob. 

**Next Steps:**  In the next round, you should counter with an offer closer to your minimum, but still leaving some room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the market value.  However, this product offers unique advantages and capabilities that justify a premium price.  I could consider letting it go for $1,800,000."", 
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle (But Still High):**  We are moving closer to Bob's offer, but still staying well above his initial offer and your minimum acceptable price. 
* **Highlighting Value:**  The message emphasizes the ""unique advantages"" to reinforce the justification for a higher price.  We're not just haggling numbers, but focusing on value. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer will help gauge Bob's flexibility.  If he's willing to move significantly closer to $1,800,000, it indicates a stronger possibility of closing the deal at a price favorable to you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I still think $1,800,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if it's not accepted. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum, Acceptable Profit:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your $1,500,000 minimum acceptable price. While there's still potential for a higher price, securing a significant profit is now the priority.
* **""Final Offer"" Tactic:** Bob is using a common negotiation tactic to create urgency. While he might be bluffing, it's risky to assume he'll continue negotiating. 
* **Time Value of Money:**  Closing the deal now avoids the uncertainty of further negotiation and allows you to redeploy the capital sooner. 

**Conclusion:**  Accepting $1,400,000 secures a strong profit and mitigates the risk of Bob walking away, which would force you to accept John's lower offer."
