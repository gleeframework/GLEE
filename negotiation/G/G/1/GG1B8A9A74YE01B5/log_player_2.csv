Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your continued interest, Bob.

Alice's offer of $890,000 is still above your budget of $800,000. While it's close,  it's not worth the risk of continuing negotiations with Alice and potentially getting stuck with a higher price. You can confidently buy the product from John at your desired price point."
