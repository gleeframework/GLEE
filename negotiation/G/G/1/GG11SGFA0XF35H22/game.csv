"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to make you a deal at $850,000. This is a great opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset at a competitive price. Let me know your thoughts!",850000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tighter budget. Would you consider $650,000?",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While $650,000 is lower than what I was hoping for, I'm willing to compromise. I'm open to selling it for $750,000.  This price reflects the value of the product and gives you a significant discount.  Let's see if we can find a solution that works for both of us.",750000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $750,000 is closer, but I'm still aiming a bit lower. How about $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $700,000 is still a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about $725,000? This is my final offer.  If it's not acceptable, I'll have to move on to other potential buyers.",725000.0,Alice,5,
