"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm offering you a great opportunity to purchase a product that would be highly valuable to you. I believe it's worth at least $15,000 to you, and I'm willing to offer it at a very competitive price of $14,000. This is a one-time offer, so don't miss out! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can still do better. He knows the product is worth $10,000 to Alice, meaning there's still room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, Bob can potentially get a lower price from Alice or even from another seller."
