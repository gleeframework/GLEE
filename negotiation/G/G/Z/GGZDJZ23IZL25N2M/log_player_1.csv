{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's a bit below what I'd ideally like, but it allows for negotiation while still ensuring I can get at least $10,000, which is more than John is offering.  I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and be willing to pay closer to my asking price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $8,500 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than what I'd like to get. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can get closer to my initial $10,000 asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $9,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 9500}
``` 

I'm going to counter with $9,500. This is a compromise, closer to Bob's offer, but still leaves me with a reasonable profit. I'm hoping this counteroffer will be appealing enough for Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Okay, Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to what I'm hoping for.  It's a good compromise and allows me to make a profit while still securing the sale. I'm going to accept his offer."
