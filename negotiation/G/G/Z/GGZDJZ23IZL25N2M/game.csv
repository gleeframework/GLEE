"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend closer to $8,000. Would you be willing to go down to $8,500?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $8,500 is tempting, I'm still holding out for a bit more. How about $9,500? This would allow me to make a fair profit while still giving you a great deal.  Let me know what you think.",9500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  That seems like a fair price for both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
