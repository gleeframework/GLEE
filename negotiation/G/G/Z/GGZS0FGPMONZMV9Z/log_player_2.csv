"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product at an exclusive price. Given its high value to you at $150, I propose we make this transaction even more attractive. For a limited time, you can acquire the product for $140. This is a fantastic opportunity to secure a deal that's just shy of its perceived value to you, ensuring you save while I earn a fair profit. Don't miss out on this special offer! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $140
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json

While Alice is laying it on thick with the sales tactics, $140 is less than your maximum price of $150 and cheaper than buying from John."
