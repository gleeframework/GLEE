"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it would be perfect for you.  I'm asking $175 for it. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $175. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $175
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer is above your maximum budget of $150. You know you can get the product for $150 from John, so it makes sense to reject Alice's offer and go with the cheaper option."
