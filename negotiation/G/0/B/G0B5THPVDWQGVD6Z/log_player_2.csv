"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll find very valuable. I'm open to negotiation, but my starting price is $12,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's initial offer of $12,000 is still above Bob's maximum budget of $8,000.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you being open to negotiation. However, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 8500} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I understand you have a budget, but $8,500 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer.  How about $10,000? It's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $10,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still higher than his ideal price.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially get a lower price.  There are still rounds left, so he can try to get closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to offer $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close the deal. "", ""product_price"": 9000} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $9,000 is still below my minimum. However, I'm committed to finding a solution that works for both of us. Let's split the difference â€“ I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This way, we can both walk away satisfied. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $9,500 is a significant improvement from Alice's previous offers, it's still above Bob's ideal price.  He's within his budget, and with several rounds left, it's worth trying to negotiate a bit further.  There's a chance he can get Alice down to a price closer to his target of $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $9,500 is still a bit above my budget, but I'm willing to go up to $9,250. This would be a good deal for both of us, and it would allow us to close this deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 9250} 
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up in price, but $9,250 is still a bit too low for me.  I understand you have a budget, but I'm willing to go down to $9,400 to make this deal happen. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal quickly. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,400. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,400
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

At this point, Alice has come down to $9,400. This is still above Bob's ideal price of $8,000, but it's within his budget, and it's very close to his last offer.  It's likely that further negotiations would only lead to small price adjustments, making it more likely that Bob will spend more time and energy trying to save a small amount of money. 

Since he has the option to buy from John for $8,000, accepting Alice's offer at $9,400 is a good compromise. It allows Bob to acquire the product for a reasonable price without risking the deal falling through with Alice and then having to settle for the higher price from John."
