Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still aiming to save as much as possible. While $1,300,000 is a better price than John's, there's still room to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to potentially secure a lower price in subsequent rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1250000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer of $1,250,000, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more advantageous for both of us. How about we meet at $1,275,000? This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal and move forward! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,275,000 is still below Bob's maximum price of $1,500,000, and it's a significant improvement from the previous rounds.  It's a reasonable compromise, allowing Bob to save money while still acquiring the product.  

Continuing to negotiate could potentially lead to a lower price, but there's a risk of Alice becoming unwilling to negotiate further or the deal falling apart. Accepting this offer is the most strategic move, ensuring Bob gets the product at a favorable price without risking the deal."
