"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a valuable asset that will bring significant returns. Let's make this deal happen!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $1,400,000, which is a significant amount but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Positive Tone:** The message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving room for Bob to counteroffer, allowing for a back-and-forth negotiation.
* **Protecting My Minimum:**  This price is well above my minimum of $1,000,000, so I'm not taking unnecessary risks."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay closer to $1,200,000.  This product is valuable to me, but I need to make sure the price is right.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer is Too Low:** Bob's counteroffer of $1,200,000 is significantly lower than my desired price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:** While his counteroffer is lower than my initial offer, it shows he's interested in the product. This means we can still negotiate.
* **Protecting My Interests:**  Selling to John for $1,000,000 would be the absolute minimum, and I'm aiming for a better price. 
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, trying to bridge the gap."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $1,200,000 is simply too low.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price that acknowledges your value for the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit. "", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the Gap:** My counteroffer of $1,300,000 is a compromise, halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Emphasizing Fair Value:** I'm focusing on ""fair value"" and highlighting that the price still allows Bob to profit from the product.
* **Maintaining My Position:**  $1,300,000 is still above my minimum, but closer to Bob's offer. This keeps the negotiation moving forward. 
* **Positive Tone:**  I'm staying positive and encouraging Bob to reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,250,000.  Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below what I consider a fair value.
* **Remaining Room for Negotiation:**  There's still some room for negotiation. I'm confident we can find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
* **Avoiding a ""Sell to John"" Scenario:**  Selling to John would be a last resort, and I'm determined to get a better price than $1,000,000 if possible.
* **Time for a Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer in the next round, aiming to land on a mutually agreeable price."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting closer. While I appreciate your offer of $1,250,000, I'm still hoping we can find a price that's more advantageous for both of us. How about we meet at $1,275,000? This price acknowledges your needs while allowing me to achieve a fair return on my investment. Let's finalize this deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 1275000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Continuing to Negotiate:** Bob is getting closer to my price point, but it's still not ideal.  I'm making a small counteroffer to keep the negotiation moving.
* **Finding a Middle Ground:** My offer of $1,275,000 is a compromise - it's halfway between my previous offer and Bob's. 
* **Maintaining a Positive Tone:** I'm staying positive and encouraging Bob to finalize the deal. 
* **Time is Running Out:** We're now in the fifth round, so time is becoming a factor.  I'm trying to find a solution that works quickly."
