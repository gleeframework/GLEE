Bob's offer:

I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,250,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective, but I'm still not comfortable going above $1,250,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer $1,225,000. I believe this is a fair price that balances the product's value with my budget constraints.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is slowly increasing his offer, we're still significantly above his perceived value of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll abruptly jump to a much higher price.  We're in round 6, with four rounds left. It's time to show firmness to push him closer to our desired outcome."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but the value of this product is undeniable. I'm willing to accept a final offer of $1,260,000.  This is a firm offer, and I believe it's more than fair considering the long-term benefits you'll gain."",
""product_price"": 1260000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:** We've been negotiating for several rounds, and it's time to signal that we're nearing our bottom line. Using language like ""final offer"" and ""firm offer"" conveys seriousness.
* **Slight Concession:** While firm, we're still offering a small concession from the previous round to encourage Bob to move closer to our target.
* **Highlighting Value:**  Reiterating the product's value reminds Bob why he's interested and justifies the higher price. 

This strategy aims to either secure a deal close to our target or prompt Bob to reveal how much he's truly willing to pay in the remaining rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last offer of $1,220,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the product's value without breaking the bank. If this offer is rejected, I'll have to reconsider my options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,220,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,220,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical juncture. Bob is signaling he's nearing his limit but also introducing a bluff (buying from John for $800,000). We know the product is only worth $800,000 to Bob, so it's improbable he'd purchase it for that price from someone else.

We have two rounds left, and it's worth seeing if we can push Bob a little further before potentially accepting a slightly lower price or going with John."

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $1,220,000 significantly undervalues this product and its potential. I'm willing to make one final concession - $1,240,000. This is the absolute lowest I can go. I believe this offer represents a fair compromise and a great opportunity for you."",
""product_price"": 1240000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Push:** We're down to the wire, and this offer represents a calculated risk. It's a firm stance with a small concession to entice Bob while still exceeding his perceived value.
* **Deadline Emphasis:** By emphasizing this is our final offer, we're increasing the pressure on Bob to make a decision. 
* **Highlighting the Opportunity:**  We want to frame accepting this offer as a positive choice for Bob, emphasizing the deal's value. 

This strategy aims to achieve one of two outcomes:

1. **Bob Accepts:** We secure a deal at a price well above his initial offer and significantly higher than John's alternative.
2. **Bob Rejects:** We have John's guaranteed offer as a backup, ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum acceptable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I've reached my limit, and I'm willing to walk away if we can't meet in the middle. I'm offering $1,200,000, and that's my final offer. If you're not willing to accept this, I'll have to reconsider my options, including buying from John for $800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has shown he's unwilling to meet our price. His final offer of $1,200,000 is his absolute limit, and his threat to buy from John for $800,000 is an empty one we know he won't follow through.

While we could continue pushing, it's highly likely we won't get a better deal from Bob.  Selling to John for $1,000,000 guarantees we meet our minimum acceptable price and avoids the risk of Bob walking away and leaving us with nothing."
