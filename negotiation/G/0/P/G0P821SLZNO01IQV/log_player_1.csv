Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why $1,150,000?**  This price represents a strong negotiation point. It's well above my minimum of $1,000,000, and still leaves $50,000 of potential profit for Bob. 
* **Risk Assessment:** There's a risk Bob might reject this offer. However, the potential gain of $150,000 outweighs the risk of getting my minimum price from John. 

**This offer aims to maximize my profit while still being attractive enough for Bob to consider.**"
