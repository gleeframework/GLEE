{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. I know it's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can find a mutually beneficial price."", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price that is a good starting point for negotiation. It's above my minimum of $8,000 but also leaves room for Bob to counteroffer, keeping the negotiation open."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my desired price range.  I'm confident I can get closer to my target price by continuing the negotiation with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $11,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10.50. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm confident I can push for a higher price, especially since Bob has shown a willingness to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a little below what I'm looking for.  How about we meet in the middle again and go with $10,750?  This is a fair compromise that allows us both to get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $10,500, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While Bob hasn't met my initial target price, accepting his offer of $10,500 is the best option.  It's a good deal for both of us, and continuing to negotiate might risk him walking away and me having to sell to John for a lower price."
