"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can bring a lot of value to your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  It's always good to start negotiations higher than your desired outcome. This leaves room for negotiation and makes you appear firm on the value of your product.
* **Above Bob's Value:** The initial offer is significantly above Bob's perceived value. This tests the waters and allows you to gauge his interest and flexibility.
* **Closer to John's Offer:**  While $2,000,000 is high, it's closer to John's guaranteed offer. This keeps the option of selling to John viable if Bob isn't willing to negotiate substantially."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its potential value while staying within my financial parameters. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,200,000 is closer to his perceived value, it's still significantly lower than both your minimum and John's offer.  You have room to negotiate and aim for a price closer to $1,500,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the significant ROI you'll see from its implementation."",
""product_price"": 1800000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Significant Decrease, but Above Target:** This counteroffer shows flexibility and a willingness to negotiate, with a $200,000 decrease from your initial offer. However, it remains significantly above both Bob's offer and your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Highlight Value:**  The message emphasizes the return on investment (ROI) to reinforce the product's value proposition and justify the higher price point. 
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By staying closer to John's offer, you maintain your leverage in the negotiation. Bob now needs to make a more compelling offer to keep you from potentially walking away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 remains too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is holding firm at $1,200,000, but this is still significantly below your minimum and John's offer. It's time to show you're willing to walk away if a compromise can't be reached.  You'll counter with a price closer to your minimum, putting the pressure on Bob to make a serious move."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't sell this product for less than $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.  I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the substantial value it will bring to your business.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  By explicitly stating this is your final offer, you signal the seriousness of the situation and that you're prepared to walk away.
* **Slight Concession, But Firm:**  You're reducing your ask by $200,000, showing some flexibility, but you're holding firm above your $1,500,000 minimum.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other options"" reminds Bob of John's standing offer, subtly introducing time pressure.
* **Focus on Value:**  You reiterate the product's value to Bob's business, hoping to nudge him toward a final decision. 

This counteroffer puts the ball firmly in Bob's court. He needs to decide if the product is worth the price you've set or risk losing out entirely."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I understand your need to maximize the sale, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  If we can't find a solution at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Above Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is above your absolute minimum of $1,500,000, making it a profitable deal.
* **Strong Counter:**  His willingness to move to $1,400,000 shows a genuine interest in closing the deal and a significant concession from his earlier position.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to push for a slightly higher price in further rounds, there's a risk that Bob will walk away. Accepting now secures a very good deal and avoids potentially losing him as a buyer. 
* **Time Value of Money:** Closing the deal now also means you receive the money sooner, which can be reinvested or used for other opportunities. 

While John's offer is slightly higher, the certainty of Bob's offer at this point outweighs the potential for a slightly better deal with further negotiation."
