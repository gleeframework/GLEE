"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in my product. I'm confident it can bring a lot of value to your business. Given its potential, I'm offering it to you for $2,000,000.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it, reflecting its potential value while staying within my financial parameters.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 undervalues the true potential of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the significant ROI you'll see from its implementation.",1800000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $1,800,000 remains too high for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $1,200,000. This price reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial constraints.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your perspective, but I need to be upfront â€“ I can't sell this product for less than $1,600,000.  This is my final offer.  I believe this price represents a fair deal considering the substantial value it will bring to your business.  If we can't agree on this, I'll need to explore other options.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I understand your need to maximize the sale, but $1,600,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to offer $1,400,000, which is a significant compromise from my initial offer.  If we can't find a solution at this price, I'm afraid I'll have to explore other options.",1400000.0,Bob,6,
