"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1000000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than what the product is worth to her ($800,000).  There's room for negotiation to get a better price.  It's worth exploring counteroffers to see if you can bring the price down closer to her value."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still a bit above your target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $875000. This is a fair compromise considering the value you place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $875,000, which is a good compromise.  This is closer to your initial counteroffer of $850,000.  While you could continue to negotiate, there's a risk that Alice might be unwilling to go lower, and you could end up paying the $1,000,000 from John.  Accepting Alice's offer ensures you get the product at a good price, and it's within your budget."
