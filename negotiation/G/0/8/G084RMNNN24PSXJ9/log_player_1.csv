{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's above Bob's value:**  At $11,500, the product is still worth more to Bob than if he doesn't buy it. 
* **It's below my minimum:**  This gives me some wiggle room to negotiate down if needed, without going below my minimum of $12,000.
* **It's a clear and concise message:**  This makes it easy for Bob to understand the offer and respond. 

I'm willing to negotiate further, but I'll also be keeping an eye on John's offer of $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is too low for me. I'm not willing to sell the product for anything less than $11,000. I'll counteroffer him and see if we can reach a compromise. I still have the option to sell to John for $12,000 if this negotiation doesn't work out."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $10,500 is just too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, which is still a great deal for you.  Let's meet in the middle on this."", ""product_price"": 11000}

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,750. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm still not willing to go below $11,000. While Bob's offer is getting closer, I'm not sure he's willing to budge much further. I'll counteroffer him again and see if we can reach a deal. If not, I'll sell to John for $12,000."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $10,875. This is the lowest I can go, but I'm still confident it's a good deal for you. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10875}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $10,500, but no lower than that. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's clear Bob is not willing to budge much further, and I'm getting too close to my minimum.  While I'd like to sell to Bob, John's offer of $12,000 is the more secure option.  I'll sell to John."
