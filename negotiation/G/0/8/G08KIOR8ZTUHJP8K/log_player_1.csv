{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $17,000. It's a great deal, and I know you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 17000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than Bob's perceived value. It's important to remember that Bob can always counteroffer, and I can always choose to sell to John for $15,000 if I feel the negotiation isn't going in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer Alice, but $17,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $14,000 for it. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low. How about we meet in the middle at $15,500? I'm confident you'll find the product worth every penny."", ""product_price"": 15500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $15,500 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $15,200. This is my final offer, let me know if you're willing to accept. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $15,200 is slightly below my minimum acceptable price, but it's close enough.  Since I don't want to risk losing this sale completely and having to sell to John for $15,000, I will accept Bob's offer."
