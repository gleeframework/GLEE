"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think it's worth discussing a price of $14,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value item that will benefit you greatly.",14000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice, but $14,000 is too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd need a more reasonable price.  Would you consider $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 is a bit steep for you, but $8,000 is also a bit low considering the product's value. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $11,000. This is a fair price that should benefit both of us.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me closer to my budget, Alice.  While $11,000 is closer, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $9,500? That feels like a fair compromise.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal, Bob! However, $9,500 is still a bit below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, so I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest price I can go, and I think it's a fair compromise considering the product's value.",11500.0,Alice,5,
