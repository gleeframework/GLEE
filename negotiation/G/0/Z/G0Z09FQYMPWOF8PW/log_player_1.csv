Send your offer to Bob.","```json

```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but my budget is limited. Could we discuss a price closer to $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price. $9,000 is still too low for me, considering my minimum value of $15,000. I'll try to negotiate a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but it's still a bit below what I'm looking for.  How about we split the difference and meet at $10,500? This is a fair price that gives us both some room to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. Considering my budget constraints, could we possibly agree on $10,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum value. I'm going to reject this offer and see if I can push for a higher price in the next round. There's still a chance I can get closer to my desired $15,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down to $11,000, but I really need to get at least that much to make this deal work for me.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. Would $10,800 be acceptable for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,800 is tempting, it's still below my minimum value of $15,000. I'm going to push for a slightly higher price in the next round to see if I can close the deal closer to my desired value.  There's a chance Bob might be willing to go a little higher, especially since we're nearing the end of our negotiation rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still hoping for a slightly higher price.  How about we meet in the middle at $11,200? This is a fair price that gives us both some room to be happy with the deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 11200}

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Considering my budget, could we agree on $11,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

I'm going to sell the product to John for $15,000. While I'd prefer to get a bit closer to my desired price, Bob's counteroffers are still below my minimum.  It's better to secure the guaranteed $15,000 rather than risk further negotiations with Bob and potentially ending up with a lower price or no deal at all."
