"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $20,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $20,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $20,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $20,000 is significantly higher than both your maximum budget ($15,000) and John's offer ($15,000). 
* Rejecting this offer opens the possibility of negotiating a lower price with Alice or proceeding to purchase from John at a better price."
