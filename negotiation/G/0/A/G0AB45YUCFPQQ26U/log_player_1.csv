Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000. This is a one-time offer."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000.
* **My Minimum:** I need to make at least $1,000,000. 
* **Maximizing Profit:**  Offering the product at $1,350,000 allows me to capture a significant portion of the value Bob places on it while still exceeding my minimum price. 

This strategy aims to:

* **Secure a Deal with Bob:**  The price is enticing enough for Bob to likely accept, as he gains $150,000 in value ($1,500,000 - $1,350,000).
* **Maximize My Profit:**  I earn $350,000 more than selling to John.

By starting with a strong offer, I increase the likelihood of a quick and profitable sale to Bob."
