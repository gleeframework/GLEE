"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,250,000, which is a significant discount from its true value to you. I'm confident that you'll find it a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer of $1,250,000 is less than your maximum budget of $1,500,000.
* Accepting this offer saves you $250,000 compared to buying from John. 

Even though you don't know the ""true value"" Alice mentions, her offer is within your budget and a better deal than John's."
