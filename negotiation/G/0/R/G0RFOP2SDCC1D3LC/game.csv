"I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $7,500. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget concerns, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about $7,250? That's the lowest I'm willing to go.",7250.0,Bob,4,
