"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $800,000 is a good starting point, but I can likely get a better deal.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer before resorting to buying from John at a much higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 700000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay more than $700,000, but not that much.  I'll try to negotiate a price closer to my initial counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. Let's meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $850,000. I think this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $850,000, which is still a good deal for me considering my maximum budget is $1,500,000.  It's a significant saving compared to buying from John, and it's likely we'll continue to go back and forth if I reject this offer.  It's time to accept and move on."
