"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $800,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value you're placing on this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. I believe this is a fair price that benefits both of us.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit too steep for me. I'm willing to go up to $750,000. Let's meet in the middle and find a price that works for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your latest offer, Bob. I'm still not willing to sell the product for $750,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer you the product for $850,000. I think this is the best price I can offer, considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,5,
