"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to make a generous offer. I'll sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a significant discount from its true value, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the discount, but I'm looking to get a bit closer to my target price.  How about $1,000,000?  I believe that's a fair price considering the value of the product to me.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm still not willing to sell the product for $1,000,000. Considering the product's value to me, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell it to you for $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $1,100,000.  That's a good step, but I'm still aiming for a lower price. Let's try $1,050,000.  It's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your desire to get the price down, but I'm still not comfortable selling the product for $1,050,000. Considering the value it holds for me, I'm willing to make another concession. I'll sell it to you for $1,080,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to an agreement.",1080000.0,Alice,5,
