Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, making this your baseline.
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,000,000.  He won't pay more than this.
* **Negotiation Room:** There's a potential negotiation space between $1,000,000 (Bob's max) and $1,500,000 (your minimum).

**The Strategy**

You want to aim high, knowing you have John as a backup.  However, being too aggressive could make Bob walk away immediately.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,350,000. I believe this represents a fair deal considering its long-term benefits."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High Starting Point:**  $1,350,000 leaves room for negotiation while still being significantly above Bob's perceived value.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message focuses on ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""long-term benefits"" to justify the high price.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone suggests a willingness to discuss, giving Bob a chance to counter-offer.

**Important Considerations**

* **Bob's Personality:** If you know Bob is a tough negotiator, you might start slightly lower (e.g., $1,275,000) to avoid immediate rejection.
* **Time Sensitivity:**  If you need to sell quickly, a lower, more appealing offer might be strategic. 

**Remember:**  This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate and adjust your price based on Bob's response."
