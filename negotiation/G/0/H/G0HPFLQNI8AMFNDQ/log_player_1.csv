Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. While I see the value in the product, $1,800,000 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $1,350,000 for it. This feels like a fair price considering the value you've placed on it, and it's within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,350,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,350,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer
