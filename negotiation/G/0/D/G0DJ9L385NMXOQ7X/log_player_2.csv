"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is better than $1,500,000, you can likely get a better deal. You have room to negotiate with Alice, as she values the product at $1,000,000.  There's a good chance you can get a price closer to that."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant reduction from Alice's initial price, but it still leaves some room for negotiation. It also demonstrates your willingness to compromise while still aiming for a price that's favorable to you."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,150,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $1,150,000 is a good compromise. It's a significant reduction from her initial offer and is still within your budget.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your counteroffer and you'll end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting this offer is a smart choice to secure the product at a reasonable price."
