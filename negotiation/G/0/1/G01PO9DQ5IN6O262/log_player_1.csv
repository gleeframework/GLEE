Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to offer it at a price of $20,000. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** While we know Bob values the product at $8,000, we don't want to start too low. It's always easier to negotiate down than up.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the product's potential benefits and hinting at a wider release, we're adding perceived value.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  The initial price leaves space for Bob to counter-offer, allowing us to potentially meet somewhere in the middle while still remaining above our minimum.

**Important Note:**  If Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John. Therefore, it makes no sense for Alice to go below $15,000 in any negotiation with Bob."
