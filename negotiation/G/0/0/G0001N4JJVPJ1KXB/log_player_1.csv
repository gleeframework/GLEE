Send your offer to Bob.,"```json

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,500. This is a good starting point as it leaves room for negotiation while still getting a good price for the product.  I'm confident Bob will find the price attractive, but if he rejects it, I'm prepared to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $13,000 is better than selling to John, I believe I can still get a better price from Bob. I will counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm going to counter with $14,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will be attractive enough for Bob to accept, but I'm prepared to negotiate further if necessary."
