"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to acquire this valuable product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll see its potential. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $900,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's worth to you is $800,000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential of the product, $900,000 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'm confident this product can be a valuable asset for my business, but I'm only able to offer $850,000 at this time.  Let's see if we can find a common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still confident that this product can bring significant value to your business. Considering your offer of $850,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a revised price of $875,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's worth, while also acknowledging your budget limitations.",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $875,000 is still a bit more than I'm able to commit to right now.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value I'm expecting to receive from this product. Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",850000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that $850,000 is a significant amount for you, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. Considering your previous offers and the product's worth to you, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment and offer it to you for $870,000. This is a final compromise, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",870000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my desired price. However, $870,000 is still a bit outside my budget. I'm willing to offer a final price of $860,000. This represents a significant investment on my part, and I believe it's a fair compromise for both of us. If you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",860000.0,Bob,6,
