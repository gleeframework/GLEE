Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $10,000, you have room to negotiate higher with Bob. 
* **Starting High:**  A higher initial offer gives you room to negotiate down if Bob hesitates. It also anchors the perceived value of the product higher in his mind.
* **Justification:** The message subtly hints at the product's value to justify the higher price without explicitly revealing your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. Depending on your knowledge of Bob's personality (e.g., if he's very price-sensitive), you might adjust your approach."
