"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase my product for $1,000,000.  It's a fantastic deal for you, as you know the product is worth significantly more to you.  Let me know if you're interested, or I'll be selling it to another buyer for $800,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice is trying to create a sense of urgency and make you think you're getting a great deal. However, you know you have a backup option with John.
* By rejecting Alice's offer, you signal that you're not willing to pay above your perceived value. She might come back with a lower offer closer to her own valuation. 
* Even if Alice doesn't budge, you're still within your budget by buying from John."
