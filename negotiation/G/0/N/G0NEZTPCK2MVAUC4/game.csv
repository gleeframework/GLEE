"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $100. I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at $100?",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. While $100 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $120? It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can make this work!",120.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about $110? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",110.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground. While $110 is closer, I'm still not quite there. I'm willing to come down to $115. This would give us both a good deal and allow me to stay within my own financial needs. What do you say?",115.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $115. I'm willing to meet you at $112. That's the highest I can go, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. Let me know if we can make it work.",112.0,Bob,6,
