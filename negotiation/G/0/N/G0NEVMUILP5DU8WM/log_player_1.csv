Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 900000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price higher than Bob's perceived value ($800,000) but lower than my minimum ($1,000,000). This leaves room for negotiation and incentivizes Bob to engage.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing the offer as a ""fair"" price, which might make Bob more inclined to accept. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that suggests I'm open to negotiation (""Let me know what you think""). This keeps the door open for counteroffers. 
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of John's offer as a safety net if negotiations with Bob break down."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:** Bob's offer of $850,000 is closer to my minimum but still below it. 
* **Potential for a Higher Price:** I believe I can push for a higher price, considering my minimum is $1,000,000.
* **John's Offer:**  John's offer of $1,000,000 is a solid backup, giving me leverage in negotiations with Bob. 

**Next Steps:** I will make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to $900,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 875000} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm suggesting a compromise by splitting the difference between my last offer ($900,000) and Bob's offer ($850,000). This shows flexibility and willingness to negotiate.
* **Value and Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the value Bob will gain from the product and framing the counteroffer as a ""fair"" compromise. This might make him more likely to accept.
* **Still Above Minimum:**  My counteroffer is still above my minimum of $1,000,000, which gives me some room to negotiate if Bob rejects this offer again.
* **Open to Negotiation:** I'm using language that keeps the door open for further discussions (""What do you say?"")."
