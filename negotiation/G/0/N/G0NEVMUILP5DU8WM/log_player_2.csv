"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the value you'll gain from it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further or buying from John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  While I value your interest, $850,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle at $875,000?  This price reflects the value you'll get from the product, and it's a fair compromise.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000.

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While he could try to negotiate further, it's likely Alice won't go lower, and he could risk losing the deal entirely.  $875,000 is a good price, especially considering John is selling for $800,000."
