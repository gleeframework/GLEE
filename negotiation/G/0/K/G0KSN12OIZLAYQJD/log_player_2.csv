"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. After careful consideration, I believe we can reach a fair agreement. My initial offer for the product is $950000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than her value for the product ($950,000 vs. $800,000).  As Bob, I want to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially negotiate a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your offer is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This represents a significant savings for you compared to your value, and it's a price that allows me to make a profit.  Let's see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Aggressive but reasonable:** This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showing Bob's willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation.
* **Focus on value:** Bob highlights the savings Alice will get by selling at this price, appealing to her own financial interests.
* **Positive tone:** Maintaining a positive tone despite the counteroffer encourages a collaborative approach."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in our product. In order to move forward, I would like to propose an offer of $900000 for the product. This reflects a compromise between our values and provides a reasonable profit margin for us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is still too high:** Even though Alice has lowered her price, it's still above what Bob is willing to pay.  There's still room for negotiation. 
* **Continuing to negotiate is beneficial:**  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially secure a better deal. 
* **John is still a viable option:** If negotiations fail, Bob can still purchase the product from John, so there's no immediate pressure to accept."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $875,000 for the product. This is a fair price that allows both of us to achieve our goals.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Incremental increase:** Bob raises his offer slightly from the previous round, demonstrating a willingness to compromise while still staying within his budget.

Round 5

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is getting closer:** Alice's offer is now within $25,000 of Bob's previous counteroffer. This shows progress and a willingness to compromise.
* **Still room for improvement:**  However, Bob can still potentially secure a better deal.  It's worth continuing negotiations to see if Alice will come down further.
* **John remains an option:** If negotiations fail, Bob still has the option of buying from John, so he's not under pressure to accept a price he's not comfortable with."

Round 6

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```
