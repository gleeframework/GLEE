* **There's room for negotiation.** You can likely get the price lower through counteroffers.
* **Buying from John is a backup option.** It's good to know you have an alternative, but it's more expensive than your goal."

```

**Reasoning:**

* **You're close to your target price.** While $1,055,000 is still slightly above your ideal price point, you've successfully negotiated a significant discount.
* **This is likely the best deal you'll get.** Alice has shown a willingness to compromise, but further negotiation may not yield a substantial price decrease.
