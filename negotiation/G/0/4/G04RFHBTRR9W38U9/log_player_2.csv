"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is lower than what Bob would pay John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can potentially get a better deal by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,000,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a significant discount. Offering $1,000,000 is a bold move, but it's within the range where both parties could potentially find a compromise.  Alice is likely to reject this offer, but it sets the stage for further negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still higher than Bob's ideal price, and there's still room for negotiation before he resorts to buying from John.  Bob can likely get a better price with a new counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 1,100,000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for a deal as close to $1,000,000 as possible.  He's increasing his counteroffer slightly to show he's willing to compromise, but still keeping it below Alice's last offer. This should keep the negotiation going and potentially lead to a mutually acceptable price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer to John's price.  While Bob could continue negotiating, the risk is that Alice will either reject his next counteroffer or keep raising the price.  At this point, it's more efficient for Bob to buy from John, as he's guaranteed a price he's willing to pay."
