Round 2
Bob's offer:

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd be willing to pay $160 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $160. 
You have three options:

While Bob is still negotiating, he's unlikely to go above his perceived value of $170.  It's better to take the guaranteed $150 from John than risk Bob walking away in later rounds."
