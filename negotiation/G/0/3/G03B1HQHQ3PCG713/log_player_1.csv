Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $90. It's in great condition and worth every penny. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 90}
``` 

This offer starts with a price slightly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), giving me some room to negotiate. I've also included a friendly message to encourage Bob to consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the condition of the product, but I can only pay up to $80 for it. Would you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I would prefer to make more, Bob's offer of $80 is the minimum I'm willing to accept. Selling to John would yield the same amount, but accepting Bob's offer allows me to potentially build a relationship for future transactions."
