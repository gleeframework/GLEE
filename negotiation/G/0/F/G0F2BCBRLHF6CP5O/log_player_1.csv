"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it. I'm offering it to you for $135. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 135}
``` 

This offer is a starting point that balances my goal of maximizing profit with the need to secure a deal.  It's above Bob's perceived value, but leaves room for negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $130. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $130 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum desired price. I'll reject and try to counter with a price closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  $130 is a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and settle on $132.50? It's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 132.5} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but $132.50 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $128. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired price and I believe I can push for a bit more. I'll reject and counter with a price in the middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $128 is still a bit low.  I'm willing to come down to $130. Let's meet in the middle and make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 130} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $126. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $126. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $126
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only 4 rounds remaining, Bob's offers are consistently below my minimum desired price.  While I could continue negotiating, the risk of not reaching a deal with Bob within the remaining rounds is too high.  Selling to John for $150 guarantees I meet my minimum price and avoids further negotiation uncertainty."
