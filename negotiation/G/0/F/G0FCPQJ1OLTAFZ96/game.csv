"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to make a one-time offer of $18000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, Alice, but I'm looking to save some money. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $12000 for the product. I think this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm afraid I need to prioritize my minimum price of $15000. Considering the value the product holds for you, I'm willing to meet you halfway at $16500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",16500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to make a counteroffer of $14000 for the product. I think this is a reasonable price considering its value to me, and I'm hoping we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",14000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $16500. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to try to reach an agreement. I'll meet you at $15500, which is still above your initial offer and closer to my minimum price. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",15500.0,Alice,5,
