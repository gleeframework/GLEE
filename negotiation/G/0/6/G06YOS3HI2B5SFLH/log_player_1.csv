Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $95. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 95}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above your minimum:** You're aiming to earn more than your minimum $80.
* **It's below Bob's value:**  He's willing to pay $100, so he has room to negotiate. 
* **It's a clear and friendly message:**  This establishes a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $85. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is close to your minimum, you can still potentially get a better deal. By rejecting his offer, you open the opportunity to negotiate further and potentially secure a price closer to your desired $95."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $85 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $90. This is a great deal for both of us, and it's a fair price for the value of this product. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit higher than $90. I'm thinking more along the lines of $87. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $87. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $87
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $87 is very close to your minimum of $80. While you'd prefer $90, continuing to negotiate may risk losing Bob entirely. Accepting his offer ensures a sale and a decent profit."
