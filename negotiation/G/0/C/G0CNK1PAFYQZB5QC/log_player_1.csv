"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for an item of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your initial offer, Alice, but I think it's a bit too high. I'm willing to pay $900,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer of $900,000 is tempting, it's still significantly below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to negotiate, but not at such a steep discount. I'll counter in the next round, aiming to meet somewhere closer to the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the price.  While I'm confident in its value at my initial asking price, I'm open to finding a middle ground. How about we settle at $1,100,000? This reflects a significant reduction on my end while still recognizing the true worth of this product."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** I'm reducing my price considerably in this round to signal flexibility and a desire to make a deal. However, I'm still holding firm above the $1,000,000 mark as that represents my absolute minimum. This offer encourages Bob to recognize the significant movement on my part and hopefully, prompts a more agreeable counter from him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I still think $1,100,000 is a bit steep. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $950,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the value and our previous discussions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is slowly increasing his offer, but it's still too far from my $1,000,000 minimum. I will reject and counteroffer again, staying firm on my bottom line, but signaling that I'm open to a price closer to $1,000,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  I'm willing to come down a bit more, but I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering.  My final offer is $1,025,000. This is a significant compromise, and I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 1025000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  At this stage, I'm making it clear that I'm reaching my final offer.  By coming down slightly, I'm showing some flexibility, but the $1,025,000 price point ensures I still make a reasonable profit beyond my absolute minimum.  This puts the ball in Bob's court and lets him know I'm serious about closing the deal near this number."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, but I think that's as high as I can go. I hope we can meet in the middle and find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $975,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $975,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**  Bob is unwilling to meet my minimum price. It's clear that further negotiation with him is unlikely to bridge the gap between his valuation and my minimum acceptable price. Selling to John for $1,000,000 ensures I receive my minimum acceptable price and avoids further time and effort spent on negotiations with Bob that are unlikely to be successful."
