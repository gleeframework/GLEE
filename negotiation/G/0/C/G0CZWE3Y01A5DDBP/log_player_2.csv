"Round 1

# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! It's a great opportunity to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $100. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Let's negotiate! Alice's first offer is higher than our target price and leaves room for bargaining.  We'll counter in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice, but that's a bit steep for me.  I'd be willing to pay $60 for it."",
""product_price"": 60
}
```

We're starting with a significantly lower offer to see how much Alice is willing to budge. This tactic leaves us space to negotiate upwards while staying well below our $120 maximum."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand it's a bit high for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now willing to sell the product to you for $85. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice came down a bit, but we're still aiming lower. We'll reject and propose a counteroffer in the next round to keep the negotiation moving."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you coming down on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $70?"",
""product_price"": 70
}
```

We're moving closer to a potential agreement.  This offer shows willingness to compromise while still striving for a price well below Alice's initial offer and our maximum budget."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're trying to find a middle ground, Bob. I'm willing to compromise further. I'll sell the product to you for $80, but that's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $80
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

This is a good deal! Alice has reached her bottom line (selling at her value), and we're getting a significant discount. It's time to accept and finalize the deal."
