Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $10,000.  Let me know if you're interested!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We know Bob values the product at $8,000.  This gives us a baseline, but we should aim higher since your minimum acceptable price is also $8,000.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $10,000 allows room for Bob to negotiate down, potentially meeting somewhere in the middle. 
* **Backup Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $8,000 to John, so there's limited risk in aiming higher with Bob. 

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit while still offering Bob a price he might consider reasonable."
