``` 

This offer is a starting point. I'm aiming for a price closer to my minimum of $12,000, but I'm also recognizing that Bob values the product at $8,000. This offer leaves room for negotiation while still giving me a decent profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a more agreeable price."

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand you're looking closer to $9,000. While I can't quite meet that, I could go up to $7,000. That's a significant increase from my previous offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum, and I'm not willing to settle for that price. I'll counteroffer again, but I'll also be prepared to sell to John if we can't reach an agreement."
