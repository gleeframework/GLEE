Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this price reflects its worth."",
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($12,000) as possible without losing the sale.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Offering $11,500 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate down slightly while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice. 
* **Backup Option:** Knowing John will buy the product for $10,000 provides a safety net. If Bob rejects the offer, Alice doesn't lose out entirely."
