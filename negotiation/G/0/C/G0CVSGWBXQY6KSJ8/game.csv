"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,250? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you.",10250.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10000.0,Alice,5,
