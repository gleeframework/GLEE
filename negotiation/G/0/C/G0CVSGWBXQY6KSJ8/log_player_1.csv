{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:** I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a significant discount from my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, but it leaves room for negotiation.
* **Value for Bob:** $12,000 is still a good deal for Bob, as it's $4,000 less than his perceived value.
* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer allows for potential counteroffers from Bob, giving us a chance to find a mutually agreeable price.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my offer, I can always go with John's offer of $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product.  This is my best offer, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  Bob's offer of $8,500 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000 and even less than my initial offer. 
* **Negotiation:**  I'm not willing to accept such a low price, and I believe there's room for further negotiation.  Rejecting his offer allows me to send a counteroffer and try to reach a more agreeable price.
* **Plan B:** If negotiations fail, I can always fall back on selling to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on my minimum value."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $8,500 is simply too low.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $10,250? This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's still a great deal for you."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer of $10,250 is a midpoint between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,500. This shows a willingness to compromise and find common ground.
* **Value for Bob:**  $10,250 is still significantly less than Bob's perceived value of $8,000, making it a potential win for him.
* **Plan B:** If Bob rejects my counteroffer, I can still fall back on John's offer of $15,000, so there's no risk involved.
* **Staying Firm:**  While I'm willing to negotiate, I'm not going to accept a price that's too far below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,250 is still above my budget.  I'm prepared to pay $9,000 for the product. This is a fair price that benefits both of us, and I'm hoping we can reach a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to the Limit:** While $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable value of $15,000, it's still significantly lower than I would prefer.  
* **Potential for Better Deal:** I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob has shown a willingness to increase his offer, and I think I can get a better price with one more counteroffer.
* **Plan B:** If negotiations fail, I can still sell to John for $15,000, so there's no risk in continuing to negotiate."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, and I'm willing to make one final concession.  I'll offer you the product for $10,000. This is a fair price, and I'm confident it's a good deal for you.  If this doesn't work for you, I'll have to move on to another buyer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Concession:**  This is my final counteroffer, and I'm reducing the price to $10,000, which is still above my minimum acceptable value of $15,000.
* **Motivating Factor:**  I'm stating that this is my final offer, and if Bob rejects it, I'll move on to John, who will pay my minimum price.  This creates a sense of urgency for Bob.
* **Compromise:** I'm showing a willingness to compromise while still ensuring I get a reasonable price. 
* **Plan B:**  If Bob rejects this offer, I have a guaranteed sale with John at $15,000, so I'm not risking losing out."
