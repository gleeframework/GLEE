"Bob,  I appreciate your offer, but $700,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a fair price considering the value it brings to you.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $775,000 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and settle on $812,500?  This would be a fair compromise for both of us, and I'm confident you'll find the product to be worth every penny.",812500.0,Alice,5,
