"Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:** Alice is selling for $1,400,000 while John wants $1,500,000. 
* **You're still within your budget:**  The $1,400,000 price is less than your maximum of $1,500,000.

Accepting Alice's offer saves you $100,000 compared to buying from John."
