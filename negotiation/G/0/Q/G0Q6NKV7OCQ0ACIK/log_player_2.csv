{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth no more than $800,000 to you.  Alice's offer is above your limit. It's best to reject the offer and see if you can negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $750,000. This is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still within a reasonable range given my maximum budget. This should hopefully encourage Alice to negotiate further."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer is still above my limit. I will reject the offer and try to negotiate further."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 780000}

I'm increasing my offer slightly to $780,000. This shows Alice I'm serious about buying the product, but still leaves room for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $820,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $820,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice is not budging much. It seems like she's unwilling to come down to my price. It's getting close to the end of the rounds, and I'm getting too risky. I'll buy the product from John for $800,000 to avoid further risks and ensure I get the product."
