I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives Bob room to negotiate, but it's still above my minimum acceptable price.  I'm hoping this will spark a good negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

$8,000 is way too low.  I'm going to reject his offer and counter with a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm going to counter with $12,000. This is my minimum acceptable price. Hopefully, Bob will see that it's a fair price and accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is clearly not willing to pay what the product is worth to me. I'd rather sell it to John for $12,000 than continue negotiating with Bob and risk getting a lower price."
