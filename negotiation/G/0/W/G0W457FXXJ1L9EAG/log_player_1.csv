Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its worth significantly more in the market."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,200,000, I want to see if I can get a higher price from Bob.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product slightly below my minimum acceptable price ($1,200,000) creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gets a $100,000 discount compared to my other offer.
* **Urgency and Exclusivity:**  The wording emphasizes that this is a limited-time offer specifically for Bob, encouraging him to act quickly.

**Why this approach is better than offering at $1,200,000 or slightly above $800,000:**

* **Offering at $1,200,000:** Leaves no room for negotiation and Bob has no incentive to buy immediately. 
* **Slightly above $800,000:**  While it might seem like a good starting point, it significantly undervalues the product and leaves a lot of potential profit on the table."
