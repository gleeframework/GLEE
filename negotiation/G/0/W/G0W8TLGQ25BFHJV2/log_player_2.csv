"Alice's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**  Alice's offer is significantly lower than your maximum budget of $150. Accepting her offer saves you a considerable amount of money. There's no need to risk a counteroffer that might be rejected, leading to a higher price or even losing the deal entirely."
