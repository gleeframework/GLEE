Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your flexibility, Alice. Based on my calculations and budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000

{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  While I could likely push for a bit more, accepting at $1,080,000 is a solid deal. It's significantly more than my minimum and Bob is clearly trying to reach a fair agreement.  There's always a risk Bob will walk away, and I don't want to risk losing this deal for a potentially small gain."
