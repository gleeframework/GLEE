"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a price closer to my budget. I propose a counteroffer of $900000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While $900,000 is better than $800,000, it's still far below the product's worth to Bob ($1,500,000).  There's room to negotiate further and potentially achieve a better price."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $900,000 is significantly below the product's true value.  Considering its potential for your business, I believe a price closer to $1,100,000 would be fair for both of us.  Let's keep the negotiations moving and see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 1100000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your response. I understand the value of the product, but I need to stick to my budget. I am willing to offer $1000000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $1,000,000 is closer to the product's worth to Bob, we're still significantly below its potential value to him ($1,500,000).  There's room for negotiation, and by rejecting the offer, we can potentially push the price even higher."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,000,000 is closer to what I had in mind, we're still a bit apart.  I believe $1,050,000 is a fair price that reflects the product's value and your potential gains. Let's find common ground to finalize this deal."", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I've considered your latest offer, but I still feel that $1000000 is a fair price for the product. I hope we can agree on this amount. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While we haven't reached the ideal price, Bob is sticking to $1,000,000, and there's a risk that he might walk away if we keep rejecting. Accepting his offer is the safest move in this situation. We've secured a sale above John's offer and made significant progress in the negotiation."
