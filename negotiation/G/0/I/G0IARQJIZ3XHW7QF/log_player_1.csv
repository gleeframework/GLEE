Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but it sets the stage for a potential negotiation.  I want to see if Bob is truly interested and willing to pay a premium for this product. If he rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and adjust my strategy accordingly.  I'm always prepared to walk away and sell to John for $800,000, but I'm optimistic about getting a better price from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to accept it just yet.  I believe I can get a slightly higher price, especially since he clearly values the product at $800,000. I will counter with a price closer to my initial offer, but lower than $1,000,000. I want to see if there's any wiggle room."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm offering $900,000. This is a compromise, demonstrating that I'm willing to negotiate. It's also a price that is still significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $800,000.  I believe this offer is fair and attractive, and I hope Bob will accept it. However, I'm ready to continue negotiating if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer of $850,000. While it's not my ideal price, it's a fair compromise. Bob is clearly willing to pay more than John, and it's unlikely I'll get a significantly better price by continuing to negotiate. This deal secures a decent profit and ensures a quick sale, which is important to me."
