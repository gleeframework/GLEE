# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000.

It's time to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **We're getting close:** Alice is consistently moving towards our desired price range. $625,000 is a significant saving from her initial offer and a reasonable compromise.
* **Limited rounds:** We only have three rounds left.  Continuing to push might backfire, leading Alice to harden her stance or us to run out of time and have to buy from John at full price. 
* **Good deal:**  While we might be able to squeeze out a bit more, saving $375,000 is already a substantial win."
