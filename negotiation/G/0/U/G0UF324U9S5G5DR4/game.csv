"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this amazing product with you. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal anywhere else. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable,  $800,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $500,000?  I think that's a fair price that reflects the value it brings to me.",500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective, but I'm not willing to go as low as $500,000. Considering the product's value, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $700,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's worth. What do you think?",700000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $700,000 is still a bit above my budget.  Would you consider $550,000? I'm eager to make this work and believe this price is a reasonable compromise.",550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your persistence, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $550,000. I'm willing to make a slightly larger concession. I'm offering it to you for $650,000. This is still a good price, considering the product's value, and I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?",650000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for your continued flexibility. While $650,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a price point around $600,000. Would you be open to that?",600000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get closer to the price you're comfortable with. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to maintain a minimum profit margin. I'm offering it to you for $625,000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the product's value. What do you think?",625000.0,Alice,7,
