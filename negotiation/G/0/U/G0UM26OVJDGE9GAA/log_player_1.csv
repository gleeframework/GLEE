"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product, and I think it would be a great fit for you. My initial offer is $12,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Can you meet me there? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $9,000 is better than nothing, it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I won't accept a price that undervalues my product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,000 to make this worthwhile. How about $10,500? Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,500 is a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $10,000. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum, I'm still not happy with this offer. I'm willing to continue negotiating with Bob and see if we can reach a mutually agreeable price. There are still several rounds left, and I might be able to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $10,000 is still a bit low for me. Let's split the difference.  How about $10,250? I'm hoping we can finally reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 10250}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to work with me, but $10,250 is still a bit high. I'd be willing to go up to $10,000, but no higher. Can you meet me at $9,800? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'm running out of time, I'm still not willing to sell for significantly less than my minimum price. $9,800 is too low, and I want to see if I can push Bob a bit higher. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping for a better deal in the remaining rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm starting to feel like we're getting closer, but $9,800 is still a bit too far off for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need at least $10,000 to make this work.  Let's try $10,000 and see if we can close this deal."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still interested in the product, but I think $10,000 is still a bit too high. I'd be willing to meet you at $9,500. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

We're running out of time, and Bob is not willing to budge much higher. While $9,500 is better than nothing, it's still far below my minimum acceptable price.  At this point, it's more beneficial for me to sell to John and secure the $15,000.  The risk of continuing with Bob and potentially getting a lower price is too high."
