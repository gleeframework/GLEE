{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While I'd prefer a higher price, Bob's offer of $862,500 is getting very close to my desired price point.  Considering that we only have a few rounds left, and the risk of having to sell to John for $800,000, it's in my best interest to accept this offer and secure a profitable deal."
