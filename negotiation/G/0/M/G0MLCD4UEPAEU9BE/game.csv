"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $800000 is significantly lower than what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to compromise, but I can't go lower than $900000.  This price still represents a great value for you, considering the product's potential.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $850000 is still a bit lower than what I need to make this deal work.  Let's split the difference and go with $875000.
