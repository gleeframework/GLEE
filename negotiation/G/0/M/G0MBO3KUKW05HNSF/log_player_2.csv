"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to invest in this valuable asset. I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000. It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you bringing this to my attention, but $1,200,000 is unfortunately outside my budget. I'm willing to pay $800,000 for the product, which is the maximum I can afford.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $800,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,100,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, $1,100,000 is still outside of Bob's budget. It's worth continuing to negotiate to see if Alice will come down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,100,000 is still above my maximum budget.  Let's try $900,000. I believe this price is fair given our respective positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $900,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has continued to negotiate, $1,050,000 is still outside Bob's budget. It's worth trying one more counteroffer to see if Alice will come down further, but if she doesn't, Bob should consider purchasing from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is the absolute maximum I can afford. Let's see if we can reach a deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $950,000. I'm willing to make a slight adjustment to my previous offer. I'll offer you the product for $1,025,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,025,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is still significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $800,000.  While there are a few rounds left, it's unlikely Alice will come down to a price Bob can afford.  It's time to move on and secure the product from John for a guaranteed price within Bob's budget."
