Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 150}
```

I'm starting with a price of $150. This is a significant markup from my minimum price of $100, but I believe it's a fair starting point to see if Bob is interested. I can always adjust the price lower if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer of $120 is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my desired price. I'm going to reject his offer and see if I can get him to come up a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm counteroffering with $130. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer. I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value of the product and could potentially lead to a successful deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd love to get closer to my initial asking price, Bob's offer of $125 is a good deal. It's significantly higher than selling to John and only $5 less than my counteroffer. I'll accept his offer and finalize the sale."
