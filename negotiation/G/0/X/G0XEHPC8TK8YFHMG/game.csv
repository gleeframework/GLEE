I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a valuable product. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1100000. This is a competitive price considering its value to you is $800000.,1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. Considering the value of the product to me and my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $950000.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your counteroffer, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $950000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. I'm counteroffering at $1050000. This is the lowest I can go while still meeting my minimum requirements.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I am willing to increase my offer to $1000000. This is the highest I can go while staying within my budget constraints.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to increase your offer, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $1000000 is a fair price for this product. Considering its value to you and the fact that you're willing to go up to $1000000, I'm willing to meet you at $1050000, but I'm not going any lower. I'm also keeping an eye on the market and other potential buyers, so I'm not feeling pressured to accept anything less than my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $1050000.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Considering our previous discussions and the value of the product to me, I am willing to offer $1025000. This is my final offer, as I do not wish to exceed my budget.",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your final offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $1025000. I've already compromised on my price, and I'm not willing to go any lower. Considering the value of the product to you and the fact that I have other interested buyers, I'm willing to make one last offer. I'm counteroffering at $1075000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident that it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1075000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Alice. I am unable to meet you at $1075000 given my budget constraints. I am willing to offer $1050000 as my final offer.",1050000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to accept $1050000. I've already made significant concessions, and I'm not willing to go any lower. At this point, I'm starting to think that selling to you might not be the best option for me. I'm willing to make one last offer, but I need you to meet me at my minimum price of $1100000. If you're not willing to do that, I'll have to explore other options, including selling to John for $1200000. The choice is yours.",1100000.0,Alice,9,

"After careful consideration, I am willing to offer $1080000 as my final offer for the product. I hope this meets your expectations and allows us to reach an agreement.",1080000.0,Bob,10,
