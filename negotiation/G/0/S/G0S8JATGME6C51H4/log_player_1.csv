**Reasoning:**

Bob is firmly rooted at $1,100,000.  It's unlikely he'll budge much higher, and further negotiation is likely to be fruitless.  John offers a guaranteed $1,200,000 which meets my minimum acceptable price. It makes the most business sense to cut my losses with Bob and move on to the guaranteed sale."
