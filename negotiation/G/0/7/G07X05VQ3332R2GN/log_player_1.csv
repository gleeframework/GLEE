Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree the product is valuable, that price point is a little high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  That said, $925,000 is still a bit too high for me. I could meet you halfway at $787,500.  This offer represents a fair compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $787,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $787,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, we're still leaving a significant amount of money on the table. We have time and John as a backup, so the risk of continuing to negotiate is relatively low."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a competitive price. Let's try to find a middle ground.  I can go down to $875,000.  This offer reflects the true value of the product and is my final offer."",
""product_price"": 875000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firmness:**  By stating this is our final offer, we introduce a sense of urgency and firmness. This could push Bob to be more decisive.
* **Strategic Concession:** We're making a smaller concession than in previous rounds, signaling we're nearing our bottom line. 
* **Justification:**  We're reiterating the product's value, which can help justify the price in Bob's mind."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're right we're getting close. Given your final offer, I'd be willing to split the difference and purchase at $837,500. Let me know if that works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $837,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $837,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitable Deal:**  $837,500 is a significant profit above our minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000.
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate might yield a slightly higher price, but there's no guarantee. Accepting now secures the deal and avoids potential losses if negotiations stall.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While we could push for more, the risk of losing Bob entirely and having to rely on John's offer might not be worth the potential reward of a slightly higher price."
