"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little, but how about $135? That's a fair price for both of us.",135.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm not sure $135 is the best deal for me. I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I was thinking more along the lines of $132. Can you meet me there?",132.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  How about we split the difference and settle on $133?  It's a fair compromise, and I think we can both be happy with that.",133.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit short of my budget. How about we meet in the middle again, but this time at $131? I'm willing to pay a bit more, but I need to stay under $130",131.0,Bob,6,
