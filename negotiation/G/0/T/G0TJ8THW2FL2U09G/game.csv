,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $130 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little more, how about $155? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",155.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that the product is valuable, but I'm still not comfortable with $155. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $130 and $155. How about $142.50?",142.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I understand you're trying to find a good price, but $142.50 is still too low for me. I'm willing to go down to $148. This is a fair price considering the product's value. Let's close the deal at this price.",148.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $148 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at this price?",145.0,Bob,6,
