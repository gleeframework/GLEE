"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,700,000. This is a fair price considering the value this product brings to your business. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1700000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,400,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to come down to $1,550,000. This is a fair price that considers both our needs.  Let's finalize this deal.",1550000.0,Alice,5,
