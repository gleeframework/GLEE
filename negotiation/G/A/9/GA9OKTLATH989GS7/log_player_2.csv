Alice's offer:

Alice is still offering a price that's higher than your budget. While you can't be certain of her true bottom line, it's worth trying to negotiate further."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, $750000 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay above $900000 to make it worth my while. How about we meet at $950000?

While $950,000 is close to your budget, you can still try to negotiate a lower price. You can offer a price closer to $800,000 and see if Alice is willing to meet you halfway."

Alice is still offering a price higher than your budget. It's time to cut your losses and buy the product from John for a guaranteed $800,000. Continuing to negotiate with Alice risks going over your budget and getting a worse deal."
