Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a high price, knowing it's more than Bob values the product. This gives us room to negotiate, and I'm confident John will be a backup if Bob doesn't come around."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, but I believe we can still negotiate a better price. I'm rejecting his offer to see if he'll come up with a better counter-offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

```

I'm lowering my price slightly to show flexibility, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my value than Bob's offer. I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to his value, not mine.  I'm not willing to go lower than my minimum. It's time to cut my losses and go with the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
