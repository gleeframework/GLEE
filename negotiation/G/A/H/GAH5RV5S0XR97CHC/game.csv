"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you today.  I think it would be perfect for you and I'm hoping we can make a deal.  To start things off, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $20,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $12,000?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for the offer! I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I could be flexible. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000?",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  While $17,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something below $15,000. Would you be willing to go down to $14,000?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I see where you're coming from, but $14,000 is cutting it a bit too close for me. I know this product is valuable and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.  How about we settle at $15,500? That's my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
