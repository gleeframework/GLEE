"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate it, but I am looking to keep my spending within $120. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to $120?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a great deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $120 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $127.50?  It's still a good price for you, and it gives me a bit more to work with. Let's make this happen!",127.5,Alice,3,

"Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm still hoping to stay within my budget of $120. Could we possibly meet at $125?",125.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob,  I'm really trying to work with you here, but $125 still doesn't work for me. How about we split the difference again?  I'll come down to $126.25.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it keeps the deal moving forward. What do you say?",126.25,Alice,5,

"Hello Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still aiming to stick to my budget. Could we meet at $124?",124.0,Bob,6,
