Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $2,000,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, you start with a higher offer to maximize potential profit.
* **Justification:** The message emphasizes the product's ""value and potential"" to justify the high price. 
* **Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly.

**Important Considerations:**

* This strategy assumes Bob highly values the product and might be willing to pay a premium to secure it.
* There's a risk Bob might reject the offer, leading you to sell at your minimum price to John. However, the potential for a higher profit justifies the risk in this scenario."
