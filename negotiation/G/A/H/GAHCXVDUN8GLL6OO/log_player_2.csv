"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $700,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we compromise at $950,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence, and I'm glad we're close to a deal. However, $800,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. How about we meet at $900,000? It's a fair price that I think we can both agree on. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

Alice has consistently rejected our offers at or below $800,000. It's unlikely she'll go that low.  Since we have the option to buy from John at $800,000, there's no point in continuing the negotiation with Alice and potentially risking a higher final price."
