"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value of your product, but I believe I can find something similar within my budget. I am willing to pay up to $12,000 for the product. Would that be acceptable? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price.  I'll counter with a price slightly lower than my initial offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $13,500.  This is still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 13500}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $12,500 is closer to my desired price, I'm still not comfortable accepting it yet. I'll counter with a slightly lower price again in the next round. I want to see if I can squeeze out a few more dollars."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up a bit.  However, $12,500 is still a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000. This is a fair price, and I believe it's a good value for you. Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for adjusting your offer. I am willing to consider $13,000, but I would like to counter with $12,800 for the product. I hope this proposal works for you. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While I would prefer a higher price, Bob has come up significantly from his original offer.  With only 4 rounds remaining, it's not worth the risk of continuing to negotiate.  Accepting this offer will secure a good profit, and it's closer to my desired price than selling to John."
