Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase this product before I list it publicly.  Given its value and the interest I've had in it, I'm proposing a price of $20,000.  This is a limited-time offer, as I already have a strong potential buyer lined up. Let me know your decision soon!"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  While we know Bob's perceived value is lower ($8,000), we want to anchor the negotiation high. This leaves room for potential negotiation or for Bob to accept a still profitable price. 
* **Creating Urgency:** Mentioning another buyer (John) creates a sense of scarcity and encourages Bob to act quickly.
* **Justification:** Vaguely mentioning the product's value and other interest helps justify the high asking price without revealing your true bottom line. 

**Important Note:**  Even if Bob rejects this offer, Alice has a guaranteed sale at $15,000 to John.  There is potential to negotiate with Bob down to a price above $15,000, which would be a win for Alice."
