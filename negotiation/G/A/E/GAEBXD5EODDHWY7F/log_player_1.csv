Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested parties."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:**  We start high to maximize potential profit. Since the product is worth $1,000,000 to you (Alice) and John is willing to pay that, there's no need to go below that figure.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to negotiate. He might counter-offer, and you can then slightly reduce the price while still staying above your minimum.
* **Urgency and scarcity:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" creates a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to act quickly and accept the high price.

**The goal is to secure a deal closer to $950,000.** However, even if Bob negotiates down slightly, you're still guaranteed a significant profit above his perceived value and your secured alternative with John."
