"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, I know you'll find it incredibly valuable.  I'm asking for $14,000 to start.  What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's still higher than the product's worth to Alice ($12,000).  This indicates there's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested, but $14,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for it.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand where you're coming from, but I'm looking for something closer to $13,750. It's a fantastic product and well worth the investment.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,750

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's target, it's still higher than the product's value to Alice ($12,000). Bob can likely get a better price by continuing to negotiate.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to make a counteroffer and potentially reach a more favorable price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $13,750 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $13,375?  I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 13375}
