Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a unique product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair deal considering the significant benefits it offers."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Knowing Bob values the product at $800,000 and I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,000,000, I want to start high to maximize potential profit. 
* **Room for negotiation:** The offer leaves room for Bob to negotiate down, while still ensuring I get a significant portion of the potential value.
* **Justification:**  The message emphasizes the product's value without revealing specific details, making it seem more appealing. 

This strategy aims to strike a balance between securing a deal with Bob at a high price and ensuring I don't lose the sale entirely."
