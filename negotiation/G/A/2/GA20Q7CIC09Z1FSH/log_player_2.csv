{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Buying from Alice for $10,000 saves you $2,000 compared to buying from John.
* Even though you could potentially negotiate a lower price with Alice, the risk of her rejecting your counteroffer is not worth it. You're guaranteed to save money by accepting her offer."
