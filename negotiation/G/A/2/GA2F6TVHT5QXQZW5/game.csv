"Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I think that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product holds significant value. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for your profit.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to where I need to be. How about $700,000? I'm serious about making this deal, and I think this is a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's make this deal happen.",850000.0,Alice,5,
