"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a valuable asset, and I'm confident you'll find it very profitable.  Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price that's significantly higher than Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for compromise:**  This initial offer allows for multiple rounds of negotiation without immediately resorting to John's offer. 
* **Positive message:** I'm framing the offer in a way that highlights the potential benefits for Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I think that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $600,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. Accepting this offer would result in a substantial loss.
* **Negotiation is still possible:**  While Bob's initial counteroffer is low, there's still room for negotiation.  I'm not ready to settle for such a low price yet. 
* **Preserving options:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to explore more favorable terms and doesn't immediately force me to accept John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product holds significant value. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for your profit.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise but not too much:** I'm lowering my price from $1,100,000 to $900,000, showing flexibility without sacrificing too much of my desired profit margin.
* **Highlighting value:** I'm still emphasizing the value of the product to motivate Bob to consider a higher offer.
* **Positive tone:** The message remains positive and encourages continued negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  I'm getting closer to where I need to be. How about $700,000? I'm serious about making this deal, and I think this is a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still too low:**  $700,000 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $1,200,000. While Bob is showing some willingness to negotiate, the offer is not yet within a reasonable range.
* **Maintaining leverage:** By rejecting Bob's offer, I keep the pressure on him to increase his bid. 
* **Time is on my side:** We're only in round 4, and I have several more rounds to potentially secure a more profitable deal.
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I can always fall back on John's offer of $1,200,000 if the negotiations with Bob don't yield a satisfactory result."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bridging the gap:** This offer is a significant compromise, moving closer to Bob's range but still maintaining a comfortable profit margin for me. 
* **Emphasize value and concession:** I'm reiterating the product's value and highlighting the concessions I've made, hoping to motivate Bob to meet me halfway.
* **Positive and encouraging:**  The message remains positive, encouraging Bob to see the potential for a mutually beneficial agreement."
