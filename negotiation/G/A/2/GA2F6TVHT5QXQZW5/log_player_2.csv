""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  However, that price is a little high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $600,000.  I think that's a fair price that recognizes the product's value."",

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is simply too low.  I understand you have a budget, but this product holds significant value. Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $900,000. This price reflects the value of the product while still leaving room for your profit.  Let's keep this negotiation moving forward. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your persistence. While $700,000 is a step in the right direction, it's still not quite there. Considering the value this product brings, I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This price reflects a significant concession on my part, and it allows us both to walk away with a positive outcome. Let's make this deal happen. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice is coming down in price, she is unlikely to go below $800,000. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price.  It's time to cut your losses with Alice and take the sure thing with John."
