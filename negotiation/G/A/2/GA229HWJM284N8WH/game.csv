"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still not comfortable going that low. I can do $18500, which is the lowest I'm willing to go. It's a great deal for you, and I think you'll really love the product. What do you think?",18500.0,Alice,5,

"Hi Alice, I understand that you're not willing to go any lower, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you at $16000, which is the highest I'm willing to pay. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $10000.",16000.0,Bob,6,
