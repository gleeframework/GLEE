"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $750,000. I'm interested in making a deal, but I need to stay within my budget.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is a bit too low for me.  How about we split the difference and I come down to $800,000?  That's still a great deal for you, and it allows me to get closer to my desired price.  What do you say?",800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000, so I'll offer $775,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",775000.0,Bob,4,
