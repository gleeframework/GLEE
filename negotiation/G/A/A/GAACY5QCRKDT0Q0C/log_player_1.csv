"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity with significant potential value. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm opening with a high price to leave room for negotiation and maximize my potential profit. 
* **Emphasis on Value:** Highlighting the product's potential value might make Bob more inclined to consider the offer.
* **Open Communication:** I'm encouraging Bob to respond and start the negotiation process. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer. I'll be monitoring Bob's responses and adjusting my strategy based on his counteroffers and the remaining rounds.  I'll also keep in mind the $800,000 backup offer from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Too Low:**  $600,000 is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $800,000. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While Bob's offer is low, his interest in the product is clear. I believe I can negotiate a better price in the following rounds. 
* **John's Offer is a Safety Net:** I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John, which gives me leverage in negotiations with Bob.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my desired range, aiming to find a middle ground while still protecting my minimum value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is lower than I'd hoped for, I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter Offer with Justification:** I'm not simply rejecting Bob's offer, but providing a counteroffer with a clear reason â€“ acknowledging his price while still emphasizing the product's value.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I'm aiming to meet Bob halfway, bridging the gap between his offer and my minimum value.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still above my minimum value of $800,000, allowing for further negotiation if needed.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully monitor Bob's response to this counteroffer. If he rejects again, I'll adjust my strategy based on the remaining rounds and John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $850000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $700000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below the $800,000 threshold I've set for myself. 
* **Negotiation Room:** We've already narrowed the price gap considerably.  I believe further negotiation can bring us closer to a mutually agreeable price.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John, which gives me the flexibility to continue negotiating with Bob without settling for a price below my minimum.

**Next Steps:**

I will counteroffer Bob again, likely with a price slightly lower than my previous offer but still above my minimum, hoping to reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to continue working towards a deal. I can offer you the product for $750,000. This is a significant compromise on my end, but I believe it reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 750000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Further Compromise:** I'm lowering my offer slightly to show my willingness to negotiate and find a solution.
* **Focus on Fairness:** I'm emphasizing the compromise I'm making and framing the offer as fair for both parties.
* **Pressure to Conclude:** I'm signaling that I'm serious about reaching a deal in the remaining rounds.

**Next Steps:**

I will carefully observe Bob's response to this offer. If he rejects again, I'll have to consider if it's worth continuing negotiations or accepting John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $750000 is still a bit high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $675000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still Below Minimum:** Bob's offer of $675,000 is still below my minimum acceptable value of $800,000.
* **Limited Rounds Remaining:** We only have 4 rounds left, and the gap between our desired prices is still significant.
* **John's Offer is Secure:** I have a guaranteed $800,000 offer from John, which provides a safety net.

**Next Steps:**

I'll counteroffer Bob with a price closer to my minimum, aiming to close the gap and hopefully reach an agreement within the remaining rounds. I'll also keep John's offer in mind and be prepared to accept it if negotiations with Bob stall."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're getting close. I'm willing to go down to $725,000.  This is my final offer, as I value the product highly and don't want to go any lower.  Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 725000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Final Offer:**  I'm signaling that this is my final offer, putting pressure on Bob to accept.
* **Close to Minimum:**  $725,000 is just slightly above my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves room for a profitable deal.
* **Sense of Urgency:** Highlighting the urgency of the situation (limited rounds remaining) might encourage Bob to accept.

**Next Steps:**

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to seriously consider accepting John's offer. With only 3 rounds left, the chances of reaching a better deal with Bob are diminishing."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $675000. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $675,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $675,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Time is Running Out:** With only two rounds left, the chances of reaching a deal with Bob at a price I'm comfortable with are slim.
* **John's Offer is Safe:** Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable value. 
* **Risk of Losing Out:**  Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks losing out on a secure deal with John and potentially ending up with an even lower offer from Bob. 

**Conclusion:**

While I'd prefer to get a higher price, securing a deal with John is the most prudent move at this point, given the limited time and the likelihood of Bob not meeting my minimum value."
