Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. I believe it's a great deal for you, considering its value to you.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price close to Bob's perceived value, giving me room to negotiate.
* **Appealing to Value:** I highlight the product's value to Bob, making the offer more attractive.
* **Open-Ended Question:** The open-ended question encourages Bob to respond and potentially engage in further discussion. 

This strategy aims to secure a good price while leaving room for negotiation if needed."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $14,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $12,000 is a reasonable offer, it's still below my desired price point.
* **Negotiation Room:** I want to maintain some leverage and see if I can push Bob higher.  
* **Selling to John:**  Selling to John for $10,000 is a last resort. I want to try and get more from Bob if possible.

**Next Steps:** I will counteroffer Bob with a price higher than $12,000 but lower than $14,000. This will allow for further negotiation and hopefully lead to a more favorable outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I'm open to negotiating, $12,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $13,000.  This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 13000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** My counteroffer shows a willingness to compromise by dropping the price from $14,000 to $13,000.
* **Maintaining Value:** I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my desired price point while acknowledging Bob's initial counteroffer.
* **Reiterating Value:**  I again highlight the value to Bob to encourage him to accept.
* **Open to Agreement:** I end with an open-ended statement that emphasizes my desire to reach a mutually agreeable price. 

This strategy aims to maintain a balance between pushing for a higher price and demonstrating flexibility to reach a deal."
