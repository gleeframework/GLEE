"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this incredible product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,300,000. I believe this reflects the significant return on investment you'll see."",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High (but not ridiculously so):**  I'm beginning with a price significantly higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to gauge his interest level. 
* **Justification:** I'm framing the high price by highlighting the product's ""unique value and potential"" and emphasizing a strong ""return on investment."" This focuses on the benefits to Bob.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is positive and suggests I'm willing to have a conversation about price.

This strategy aims to:

1. **Maximize Potential Profit:**  There's a chance Bob might accept a high price if he's particularly eager.
2. **Gather Information:** Bob's response will give me insight into his negotiation style and how much he values the product. 
3. **Control the Negotiation:** By starting high, I anchor the negotiation in my favor."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product and appreciate your enthusiasm. However, given my budget constraints, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,800,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,800,000 is a tempting offer, it's still significantly lower than my initial ask. By rejecting, I signal that I'm willing to negotiate but not at any price. I'll use the next round to bring the price closer to my desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your budget considerations.  To find a middle ground, I'm proposing a price of $2,100,000.  This reflects a significant reduction on my part while still recognizing the true value of this product."",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** I've made a substantial decrease from my initial offer, signaling flexibility. However, the decrease is calculated to keep me well above both Bob's offer and my minimum acceptable price.
* **Finding Middle Ground:**  My message emphasizes finding a compromise that works for both parties. This helps maintain a positive and collaborative negotiation atmosphere. 
* **Value Reiteration:** I'm subtly reminding Bob about the product's value to justify the higher price point.

This approach aims to:

* **Maintain Momentum:**  I'm keeping the negotiation moving by quickly responding with a counteroffer.
* **Test Bob's Willingness:**  This counteroffer will reveal how serious Bob is about purchasing and how much room for negotiation remains."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your effort to meet me halfway. Considering my financial situation, I would like to propose a counteroffer of $2,000,000. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is now offering $2,000,000, which is a significant profit above my minimum of $1,500,000. While I could try to push for more, there's a risk that Bob might walk away or that continued negotiation could drag on and potentially lead to a less favorable outcome. 

It's always a balance between maximizing profit and securing a good deal. In this case, the offer on the table is strong enough to warrant acceptance."
