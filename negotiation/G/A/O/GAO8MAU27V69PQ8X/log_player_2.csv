"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for your offer. However, that price is significantly higher than I'm willing to pay.  Would you consider a price closer to $1,000,000?"", ""product_price"": 1000000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you getting back to me and providing your perspective on the value.  While $2,300,000 represents a fair starting point considering its potential, I'm open to finding a middle ground. Would you consider $1,800,000? This feels like a reasonable step. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,800,000

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,800,000 is still  too high for me.  Could we work with a price closer to $1,200,000?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand where you're coming from on the price. Let's try to find a solution that works for both of us.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,500,000?  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to her ""final offer"" of $1,500,000. This is still significantly higher than your maximum price of $800,000 and there's no guarantee she'll budge further. You have a guaranteed option with John at $800,000. It makes the most financial sense to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
