Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's significantly higher than your minimum:** You're already earning a profit of $400,000.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:** Bob is still getting a good deal at $1,400,000, as it's lower than his perceived value. This increases the likelihood he'll accept or at least counteroffer. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking of something more around $1,200,000. I'm willing to pay that amount for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $1,200,000 is still a decent profit for you, it's significantly lower than your initial offer. You have the potential to get closer to your desired price by continuing negotiations. 

By rejecting Bob's offer, you show that you're not willing to settle for a significantly lower price. This sets the stage for a counteroffer where you can try to bridge the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a lower price, but $1,200,000 is too far below what the product is worth. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product for $1,300,000. This is still a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still remaining profitable.
* **Appealing to Value:**  The message emphasizes that $1,300,000 is still a good deal for Bob given the product's value.
* **Room for Adjustment:** This price leaves a little room for further negotiation if needed, but it's higher than Bob's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still looking for a better deal. I'm willing to pay $1,250,000 for the product. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Profitability:** Accepting Bob's offer of $1,250,000 will still yield a profit of $250,000 for you. 
* **Negotiation Fatigue:** While you could continue negotiating, there's a risk that Bob might become unwilling to budge further.  
* **Time Value:**  Time is valuable, and continuing negotiations could take more time, potentially leading to a delay in selling the product. 

At this point, accepting Bob's offer represents a good balance between maximizing your profit and closing the deal."
