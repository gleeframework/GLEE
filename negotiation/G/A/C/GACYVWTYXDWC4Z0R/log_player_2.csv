Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $950,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is a significant investment for me. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value and my budget. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer shows you're serious about buying the product but are also committed to getting a good deal. The $850,000 price is a substantial drop from Alice's offer, demonstrating your willingness to negotiate. It also leaves room for further negotiation if needed, as you have 9 rounds remaining."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that my product will bring significant value to your business.

{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $900,000 is still a bit high for me.

This offer is a significant step closer to my desired price point, and I'm confident it's a reasonable compromise. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. However, $880,000 is still a bit higher than I can justify.

This offer is a significant step closer to meeting your needs while staying within my price range. I hope we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement."", ""product_price"": 860000}

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and willingness to negotiate further. However, $870,000 is still slightly higher than my budget allows.

This is a very reasonable compromise, and I believe it's a price we can both agree on.  What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 865000}
```

* **Emphasis on Value:**  You reiterate the value the product brings to your business, subtly reminding Alice of the potential loss if she doesn't accept.
* **Financial Constraints:** You mention your financial constraints, emphasizing the importance of finding a price that works for both parties.
* **Reasonableness:** You emphasize that $865,000 is a reasonable compromise, increasing the pressure on Alice to accept.

Round 9
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your concerns, and I'm willing to make another concession. After careful consideration, I'm willing to reduce the price to $870,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is your last chance to negotiate with Alice.  You've pushed for a lower price and gotten close to your desired range. While you might be able to get a lower price if you continue, it's risky.

* **Time Pressure:**  You're down to the last round. 
* **Reasonable Price:** $870,000 is significantly lower than John's offer of $1,200,000, making it a better deal.
* **Potential for Loss:** Continuing to negotiate risks losing the deal entirely. Alice might refuse your next offer, and you'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price.

It's better to accept Alice's offer and secure the product at a good price than risk losing the deal and paying more to John."
