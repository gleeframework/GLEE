Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $18,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer at $15,000, you can afford to start the negotiation higher. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle.
* **Justification:** By mentioning the ""value"" of the product, you subtly imply it might be worth more than Bob initially thinks.
* **Time Pressure:**  By stating you'll list it publicly, you create a sense of urgency, potentially pushing Bob to make a decision quicker. 

**Important Note:** While John guarantees $15,000, it's always good to aim higher initially in negotiations, especially when you have leverage."
