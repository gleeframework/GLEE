"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $9,500 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $10,500.  This price still allows me to make a profit while giving you a good value. Let's see if we can make this work.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800? I'm willing to compromise, but I need to stay within my budget.",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $9,800 is still a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $10,200, which is a good middle ground. If we can agree on this price, it would be a win-win situation for both of us. Let me know your thoughts.",10200.0,Alice,5,
