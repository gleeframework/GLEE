Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $149. I think you'll find it's a great deal for the value it provides."", ""product_price"": 149}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $150, aiming slightly lower initially maximizes potential profit if Bob accepts.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting near your minimum acceptable price ($150) anchors the negotiation higher.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  The ""limited time"" phrase might encourage Bob to act quickly and not overthink the offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just the first offer.  How you adjust your price (if necessary) depends on Bob's response and your negotiation strategy."
