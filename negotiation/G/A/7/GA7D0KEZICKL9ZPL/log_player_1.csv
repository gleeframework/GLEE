Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable. Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000. I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm confident this offer reflects the true worth of what's on the table."",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** Starting with a significantly higher price ($2,250,000) than Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) sets a strong anchor. This can make your eventual target price seem more reasonable in comparison.
* **Value Emphasis:**  The message focuses on the product's value to Bob (""you'll find incredibly valuable"", ""true worth""), aiming to justify the high price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** While starting high, you signal willingness to negotiate (""open to discussing this further""), making Bob feel less pressured and more likely to engage. 
* **Safety Net (John):**  You have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, which gives you a strong position to walk away if Bob doesn't meet a satisfactory price.

**Important:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob and potentially lower the price. Observe his reactions and adjust your strategy accordingly. You can always fall back on John's offer if needed."
