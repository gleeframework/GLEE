Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $100. It's a great deal for both of us! Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum price of $80, but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows that you're willing to compromise and reach a mutually beneficial agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $100 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $90 for it.  What do you say? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $90 is above your minimum price of $80, and it's likely that if you reject it, he might not go any higher. It's better to accept his offer and secure a sale than risk a further negotiation that could lead to a lower price or even no sale at all."
