"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a little high to me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $875,000?"", 
""product_price"": 875000
}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  That said,  $875,000 is still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $737,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $737,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $737,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** While Bob's offer is getting closer to our minimum, we are still in early rounds. It's worth countering one more time to see if we can push him closer to $800,000."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $737,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $825,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a great deal."",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, you're tough!  I can appreciate that.  I'm willing to move a bit.  How about $781,250? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $781,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $781,250
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob is very consistently sticking to his splitting-the-difference tactic. We're now at round 6, and his offer of $781,250 is still below our absolute minimum of $800,000. It's unlikely he'll significantly increase his offer in the remaining rounds to make it worth the risk. Selling to John guarantees our minimum acceptable price."
