"Alice, thanks for the offer.  That price seems a little high to me.  How about we start the conversation at $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter. I understand you're looking for a competitive price, but $600,000 significantly undervalues the true worth of this product.  To find a middle ground, how about we consider $875,000?",875000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me, Alice.  That said,  $875,000 is still a bit rich for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $737,500?",737500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $737,500 is closer to the mark, I'm aiming for a price that reflects the true value of this product.  Let's settle at $825,000.  This offer represents a significant discount from my initial asking price and ensures you're getting a great deal.",825000.0,Alice,5,
