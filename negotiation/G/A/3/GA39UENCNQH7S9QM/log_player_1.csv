"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this amazing product for $13,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to Bob. This gives me room to negotiate and potentially earn a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum price of $12,000. I have 8 rounds remaining and I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11,500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit."", ""product_price"": 11500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

$9,000 is way below my minimum price. I have 6 rounds left and I'm hoping to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

With only four rounds left, I'm getting closer to my minimum price but not quite there. I'm concerned that Bob may be willing to walk away, and I don't want to risk losing the deal entirely. Selling to John at $12,000 is a safe bet and guarantees me my minimum profit."
