"I'm really interested in the product, but $13000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $10000. Can you meet me in the middle?",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I can't go that low.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $11500.  This gives you a great deal and allows me to make a fair profit.",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $11500 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $9000 for the product. Can you meet me at this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal, but $9000 simply doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway again and come down to $10500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, but $10500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $8500 for the product. Can you consider this price?",8500.0,Bob,6,
