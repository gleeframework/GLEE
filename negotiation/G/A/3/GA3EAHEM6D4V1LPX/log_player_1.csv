Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm quite interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we settle somewhere around $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
