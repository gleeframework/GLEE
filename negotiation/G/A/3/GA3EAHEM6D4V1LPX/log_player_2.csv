Alice's offer:

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is simply too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  I'm hoping you'll consider this final offer.

Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $1,250,000.  At this point, it's more beneficial to take John's offer of $1,200,000.  While getting the product from Alice would be ideal, saving $50,000 is a significant amount."
