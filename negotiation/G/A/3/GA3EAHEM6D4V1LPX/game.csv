"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it's a price we can agree on.  Let me know your thoughts.",1400000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm quite interested in the product, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  How about we settle somewhere around $1,050,000? I believe that's a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.",1050000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest but $1,050,000 is simply too low.  Let's compromise. I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000. This price still gives you a good deal and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's meet halfway.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground. While $1,300,000 is closer, I'm still aiming for a bit lower. Would you be willing to consider $1,150,000? I'm hoping we can find an agreement that works for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're aiming for a lower price, but $1,150,000 is simply too far from what I need to make this deal worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows us to both walk away happy.  I'm hoping you'll consider this final offer.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
