"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll love!  I'm asking $110 for it, but I'm open to negotiating.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($100) to leave room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  A friendly and positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation.
* **Openness:** Mentioning I'm open to negotiating shows I'm willing to find a fair price. 
* **Value Proposition:**  ""Amazing product"" hints at its worth, but it's open for Bob to ask for more details. 

**Strategy:**

This first round is about gauging Bob's interest and establishing a starting point for negotiation. If Bob rejects, I'll adjust my offer in subsequent rounds, keeping John's $100 offer in mind as my fallback."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for offering the product. I understand its value, but I'm looking to stay within my budget. Would you consider selling it for $95? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:**  $95 is below my minimum acceptable price of $100. 
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed sale to John for $100.
* **Negotiation Potential:** While $95 is close to my minimum, there's still room to negotiate.  

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue the negotiation and potentially secure a higher price.  I'll counter with a price slightly higher than Bob's offer, still keeping John's offer in mind as a fallback option."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $95 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $102.50? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 102.5}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer:**  I'm proposing a middle ground between my minimum acceptable price ($100) and Bob's offer ($95).
* **Fairness:**  The message emphasizes the ""fairness"" of the price, appealing to Bob's sense of compromise.
* **Flexibility:**  Even though it's a counter-offer, I'm still open to further negotiation.

**Strategy:**

This round is about finding a compromise that keeps the deal alive while maximizing my profit.  I'm willing to move closer to Bob's offer, but not below my minimum.  If Bob rejects again, I'll need to re-evaluate my strategy, considering John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose $97.50 as the price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer:** While $97.5 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my target.
* **John's Offer:**  I have a guaranteed $100 from John.
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can still get closer to my minimum price by continuing to negotiate.

**Strategy:**

Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to keep pushing for a better deal.  I'll counter with a price closer to my minimum while keeping an eye on John's offer as a fallback.  I have several rounds left, so there's still time to secure a more favorable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $97.50 is still just a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $99.  Let's get this deal done! "", ""product_price"": 99}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:**  $99 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $100.
* **Urgency:**  The message emphasizes getting the deal done, suggesting I'm less likely to lower the price further.
* **Finality:**  ""Let's get this deal done!"" implies that this might be my final offer.

**Strategy:**

* I'm pushing the negotiation close to my limit, leaving little room for further concessions. 
* This round is about seeing if Bob will accept or if he'll risk losing the deal altogether. 
* If Bob rejects, I might consider accepting John's offer depending on how confident I am about getting a better price in the remaining rounds."
