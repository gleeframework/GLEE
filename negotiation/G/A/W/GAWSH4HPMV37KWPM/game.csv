"I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to purchase this valuable product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the negotiation at a price of $1,100,000.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I appreciate the value of this product, $1,100,000 is a bit high for me right now.  I'd be willing to pay $950,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find a mutually agreeable price.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $950,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,050,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you is $1,200,000. Let's see if we can seal the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $1,050,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value to me and your desired price. Let's see if we can close this deal.",1000000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me at $1,000,000, Bob, but I'm not ready to accept that price just yet. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,075,000. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
