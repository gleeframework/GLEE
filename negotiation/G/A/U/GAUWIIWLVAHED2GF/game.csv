"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been valued at $150 by myself. Considering its quality and unique features, I believe it would greatly benefit you and enhance your experience. Given its worth to me and its value to you, I propose we agree on a fair price. Would you be interested in discussing this further? If so, let's aim for a price closer to my valuation but still within reason, perhaps around $120. This way, both parties can benefit from the transaction. Looking forward to your response.",120.0,Alice,1,
