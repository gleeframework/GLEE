"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which we believe would greatly benefit your business. Considering its value and the impact it could have on your operations, we're extending an exclusive offer to purchase this product for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer of $950,000 is significantly higher than the product's value to her ($800,000). There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows for counter-offers and potentially a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in your product, I'm only comfortable going up to $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it offers, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This still allows us to cover our costs and ensure a fair profit while providing you with a competitive advantage in your market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $900,000 is still too high. While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still significantly above the product's value to her. There's still room to negotiate and potentially secure a better deal.  It's worth continuing the negotiation to see if a more favorable price can be achieved."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to bridge the gap."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $887,500 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $887,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $887,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $887,500 is getting close to my target price.  While I could potentially push for a lower price, there's a risk she'll reject my offer, and I might end up paying more or buying from John.  It's a good deal considering my maximum price is $1,200,000, and it's likely I won't get a better price.  Accepting ensures a purchase and avoids the risk of a breakdown in negotiations."
