"Alice,  $950,000 is a bit steep for me.  While I see the value in your product, I'm only comfortable going up to $850,000 right now.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. We appreciate your interest in our product. Considering the value it offers, we would like to counter your offer with a price of $900,000. This still allows us to cover our costs and ensure a fair profit while providing you with a competitive advantage in your market.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to offer $875,000. This is a fair price that reflects the value of the product and allows for a reasonable profit for you. Let's try to bridge the gap.",875000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. We understand your position and are willing to meet you halfway. Our counteroffer is $887,500 for the product. This price allows us to maintain a reasonable profit margin while still being competitive in the market.",887500.0,Alice,5,
