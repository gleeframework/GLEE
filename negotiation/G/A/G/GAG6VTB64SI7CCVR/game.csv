"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget maxes out at $900,000.  Let me know if that works for you.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and offer. I'm willing to negotiate, but $900,000 is below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000?",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,050,000. I'm willing to go up to $950,000.  This is a good compromise and allows us both to get a decent deal.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I'm motivated to sell, I need to get a price that reflects the product's worth. My final offer is $1,000,000.  This is a significant discount from my initial asking price and a fair deal for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
