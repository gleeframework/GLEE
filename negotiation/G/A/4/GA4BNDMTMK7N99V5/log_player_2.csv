"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I'm offering it to you for $14,000. It's worth $15,000 to you, so you'd be getting a great deal! Let me know if you're interested, as I have another buyer lined up for $10,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json

``` 

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $14,000 is lower than the price you're willing to pay from John ($15,000). Therefore, accepting Alice's offer saves you $1,000."
