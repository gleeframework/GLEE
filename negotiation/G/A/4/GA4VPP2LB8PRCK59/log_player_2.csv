"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a fair price considering its value to you, and it gives you a significant margin for profit. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,050,000?"", ""product_price"": 1050000} 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low:** I'm starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price. This gives me room to negotiate upwards and still stay well below my $1,200,000 maximum. 
* **Aiming for a Win-Win:** My goal is to get the product for a price that benefits both of us. A price closer to $1,000,000 would be ideal, but I need to leave room for compromise.
* **John as Leverage:** I have the option to buy from John at $1,200,000, which I can use as leverage in my negotiations with Alice."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While $1,050,000 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise.  How about $1,250,000?  This price still allows for a healthy profit for you and is closer to what I need to get for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice is too close to my limit:** Alice's counteroffer of $1,250,000 is only $50,000 less than my maximum budget. It's unlikely she'll go much lower.
* **John offers a guaranteed better deal:**  Buying from John for $1,200,000 guarantees I save at least $50,000 and avoid further negotiation. 

At this point, the potential savings from continuing to negotiate with Alice are outweighed by the risk of her not going low enough.  It makes more sense to take the sure thing with John."
