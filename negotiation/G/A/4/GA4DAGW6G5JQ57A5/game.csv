"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for negotiations, and I'm open to discussing further.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is unfortunately well above my budget.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product, which is still a fair price considering its value to me.  I'm open to discussing this further, but I'm not willing to go any higher.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position. However, the value of this product is quite significant, and $850,000 is a substantial deviation from what I believe it's worth. I'm willing to come down slightly, but not to that extent. How about we meet in the middle at $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $1,000,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000 for the product, which is a significant increase from my previous offer. This represents a fair compromise, and I'm hoping we can reach an agreement.",900000.0,Bob,4,
