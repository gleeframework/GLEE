"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this amazing product. I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $15,000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $15,000 is a bit steep for you, but $10,000 is also a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $13,000. Would you be willing to consider that? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting closer to your price, Bob, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go all the way to $11,000. How about we try $12,500? I'm willing to meet you halfway between $12,000 and $13,000, which is where I initially offered. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $12,500.  It's not worth the continued negotiation and risk of her raising her price. John offers a sure thing at your target price."
