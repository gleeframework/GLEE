Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

This offer starts high, but acknowledges a willingness to negotiate. It's a good starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay closer to my value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I understand the product's value to you, but I believe I can't exceed $80 for it. Would you consider meeting me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $150.  I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $80 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $120, which is still a fair price for both of us.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I must stick to my budget. I am unable to go above $80 for this product. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is closer to my minimum than Bob's initial offer, it's still significantly below what the product is worth to me. I'll reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $95 is still too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer the product for $107.50. This is the best I can do, as it's still a significant compromise for me.  Let me know if this works for you."", ""product_price"": 107.50}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your efforts to find a middle ground. However, I still feel that $107.50 is beyond my budget. I would like to propose $100 as a final offer. This allows for a bit more flexibility for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $100 is closer to my desired price, I've already made several compromises and Bob seems unwilling to go higher. At this point, it's more advantageous to sell the product to John for $150, which meets my minimum requirement."
