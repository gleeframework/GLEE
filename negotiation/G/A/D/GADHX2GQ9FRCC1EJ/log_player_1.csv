Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm starting with a price of $12,000. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum price of $8,000, but still leaves room for negotiation and a potential win-win outcome for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. $9,000 is still too low for me, especially since I know he values the product at $15,000. There's still room for negotiation, and I want to try to get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

I'm offering $10,000. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still leaves me a decent profit. I'm hoping Bob will see the value in the product and accept this offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While I would ideally prefer a higher price, $9,500 is a decent compromise, and it's much better than selling to John for $8,000.  This ensures a good profit for me and hopefully satisfies Bob as well."
