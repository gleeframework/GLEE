"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the discount, $110 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. What do you think?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $110 was a bit steep for you, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you the product for $105. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy it!",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. $105 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with. How about we split the difference and settle on $97.50? I think that's fair for both of us.",97.5,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $105 was still a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $97.50. I can offer you the product for $100. It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll really like the product.",100.0,Alice,5,
