Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$12,000:** This price is a good starting point. It's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000, but it's still higher than the product's worth to Bob ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring I don't immediately settle for a low price.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It emphasizes the value of the product without being overly aggressive.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make a counteroffer of my own, keeping in mind my minimum acceptable price and the potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product, but I'm currently working within a budget of $8,000. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down to that amount? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $12,000.  Accepting his offer would result in a significant loss for me. 

I will reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round of negotiation, aiming to find a price that is closer to my desired value while still considering Bob's budget."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $8,000 is simply too low for me. However, I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,000? This price allows me to make a reasonable profit while still being within a range you may find acceptable. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000:** This price is a compromise,  meeting halfway between my previous offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $8,000. It's a reasonable compromise that still gives me a significant profit while acknowledging Bob's budget concerns.
* **Message:** The message is positive and focuses on finding a solution that works for both parties. It avoids being confrontational and emphasizes the possibility of a mutually beneficial deal.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, I've made a successful sale!
* If Bob rejects, I'll analyze his counteroffer and decide whether to accept or make another counteroffer. I'll need to carefully consider the potential profit and the risk of losing the sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for considering my budget, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to be flexible. While $10,000 is closer than before, I'm still not able to meet you there. Could you possibly lower the price to $9,000? This would allow us to come to an agreement that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $9,000 is closer to my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 than his previous offer. While it's still lower than I would ideally like, it's a reasonable compromise considering the negotiation process and the possibility of losing the sale to John. 

Accepting Bob's offer allows me to secure a sale without risking a loss or further negotiations. It's a practical decision that balances potential profit with the time and effort involved in continued negotiation."
