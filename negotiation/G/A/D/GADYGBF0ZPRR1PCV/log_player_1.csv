Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **My minimum acceptable price:**  I'm willing to sell to John for $1,000,000, so this is my baseline.
* **Potential for higher profit:**  I want to maximize my earnings, so I'm offering a price higher than my minimum. 
* **Balancing risk and reward:**  I'm not setting the price too high that it becomes likely Bob will reject it. A $500,000 markup is a reasonable starting point to see if Bob is willing to pay more. 

**Important Considerations:**

* I don't know how much Bob values the product, so there's a risk he'll reject my offer. 
* I'm relying on my knowledge of the market and product to make a reasonable offer that balances potential profit with the likelihood of acceptance."
