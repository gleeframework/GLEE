"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's close to my minimum acceptable value, but still leaves some room for negotiation. This gives Bob an incentive to negotiate without making me feel like I'm giving away too much."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,500 is closer to my minimum, it's still below my desired value. I want to see if I can push Bob higher before resorting to selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the initial offer, but I'm still holding firm on a value that's closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob sees the compromise and is willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $9,000 is closer to Bob's valuation, it's still too far below my minimum desired price. I'm willing to risk a few more rounds of negotiation to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

I'm dropping the price a bit more, but I'm still holding out for a price closer to my minimum. I'm hoping that Bob will finally agree to a price that is closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob is not showing any signs of moving closer to my minimum desired price, and I only have 4 rounds left. It's getting riskier to continue negotiating, as I could end up with a price lower than my minimum acceptable value. Selling to John guarantees me my minimum price, so it's the safest option at this point."
