Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and while my absolute minimum price is confidential, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,400,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I do have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1400000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While we know John will buy the product for $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob above his perceived value ($800,000) is ideal. 
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product at $1,400,000 creates a sense of urgency and value. It's significantly lower than John's offer, making it attractive to Bob, while still leaving room for substantial profit above our minimum.
* **Confidentiality:**  Not explicitly revealing John's offer keeps us in a stronger negotiating position should Bob counter-offer. 

Let's see if Bob bites!"
