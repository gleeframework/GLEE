Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $12,000.  I believe this is a fair reflection of the benefits it offers. Let me know your thoughts."",
""product_price"": 12000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Alice wants to get as close to Bob's $15,000 valuation as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $12,000 leaves some space for Bob to potentially counter-offer, while still securing a significant profit for Alice.
* **Strong But Not Greedy:**  A price too close to $15,000 might scare Bob off. This offer balances profitability with the risk of losing the sale.
* **Alternative Buyer:**  Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't go below $8,000. This empowers her to aim higher with Bob."
