"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While $14,000 is within Bob's budget, it's still a significant amount. There's potential to negotiate a lower price, so rejecting the initial offer and making a counteroffer is the best strategy in this round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob wants to save as much money as possible. A counteroffer of $12,000 is a reasonable starting point. It's significantly lower than Alice's initial offer but still within a range where Alice might be willing to negotiate. This allows for potential future bargaining without immediately going too low and risking a deal falling apart."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $13,000, which is within Bob's budget and a good deal compared to buying from John for $15,000.  While there's always the potential to negotiate further, the risk of going through additional rounds and potentially reaching a stalemate or having Alice walk away outweighs the potential for a slightly lower price.  Accepting this offer secures the product at a favorable price."
