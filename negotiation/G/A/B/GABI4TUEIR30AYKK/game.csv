"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a high-quality item that will benefit your business. I'm willing to start with an offer of $14000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",14000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your initial offer, but I'm looking to save some money on this purchase. I'm willing to go up to $12000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I can meet you halfway at $13500. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and the value it holds to me.",13500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, Alice, but I'm still looking to save some money. I'm willing to go up to $13000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",13000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $13000, Bob. I can see you're trying to get a good deal, but I'm not ready to give up yet. I'll meet you at $13250. This is my final offer, but I'm willing to consider one more negotiation round if you're willing to meet me at a price that's closer to my minimum value of $12000.",13250.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further, Alice. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13250 and $12000. I'll offer $12625 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12625.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $12625, Bob. I think I've already compromised enough. I'm willing to make one more offer, and I'll meet you at $13000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13000.0,Alice,7,

"I understand you're willing to meet me at $13000, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to go up to $12800 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",12800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $12800, Bob. I've already compromised a lot, and I'm not getting any younger. I'm willing to meet you at $13500, but that's it. If you're not willing to meet me there, I'll have to consider other options.",13500.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm not willing to go back to $13500. I've already gone as high as I'm willing to go. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to an agreement. I'll offer $12900 for the product, and that's my final offer.",12900.0,Bob,10,
