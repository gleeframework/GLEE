"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for both of us to come to a mutually beneficial agreement. My initial offer is $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for the product.  This would still be a significant profit for you, and I believe it's a fair price considering the market value.",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. I'm willing to consider a price of $1,050,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $1,050,000 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to go up to $1,025,000.  This is a good compromise, and it allows us to finalize this deal efficiently.",1025000.0,Bob,4,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I was hoping we could get even closer to the sweet spot. I'm willing to meet you at $1,030,000. This is a very competitive price, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1030000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, we're getting closer! While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,030,000 is still a bit higher than I'm aiming for. Let's split the difference and go with $1,027,500. This would be a mutually beneficial agreement, allowing us to close the deal quickly and efficiently.",1027500.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession to get this deal done. I can meet you at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",1025000.0,Alice,7,
