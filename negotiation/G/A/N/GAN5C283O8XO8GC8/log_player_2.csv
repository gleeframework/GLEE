{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,025,000 is only $25,000 above my last counteroffer and is a very good price considering my goal of saving money.  Accepting this offer allows me to close the deal and avoid the risk of further negotiation, which could lead to a higher price or a failed deal. Additionally, buying from John would cost me $1,200,000, so this offer from Alice is much better."
