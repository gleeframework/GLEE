Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. This price would allow for a good margin for both of us and secure the deal.

(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
