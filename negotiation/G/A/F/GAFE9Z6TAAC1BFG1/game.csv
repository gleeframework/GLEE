"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $750,000 for it. This price would allow for a good margin for both of us and secure the deal.",750000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $750,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $850,000. This price still allows for a good margin for both of us and takes into account the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $850,000 is still above my budget.  I'm happy to compromise and offer $800,000, which is a fair price considering your product value.  This price would allow for a profitable sale for you while still allowing me to stay within my financial constraints.",800000.0,Bob,4,
