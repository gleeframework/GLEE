Alice's offer is higher than her product value, but it's still within the range of what I can afford.  I'm going to try to negotiate a lower price."

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you starting the conversation.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now.
