"Alice, thanks for the offer, but the price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I need it to be within a reasonable budget. Would you consider a lower price, closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm thinking of a price of $1,000,000, but I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $900,000. This is the lowest I can go, but I believe it's still a fair price for this incredible product.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $900,000 is still too high for my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $700,000, but that's my limit.  If that doesn't work for you, I understand, but I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",700000.0,Bob,4,
