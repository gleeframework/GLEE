,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the value. However, $1,300,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm looking for.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,350,000.  This is a good price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in it.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob,  I appreciate your persistence, but $1,325,000 just isn't going to work for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,330,000, but that's my final offer. If you're serious about this deal, I think this is the best we can do. ",1330000.0,Alice,7,
