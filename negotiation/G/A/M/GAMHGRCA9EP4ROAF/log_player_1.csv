Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting at $12,000, which is above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive framing:** My message is friendly and highlights the potential benefit for Bob.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  By offering a price above Bob's valuation, I create space for him to counteroffer, potentially bringing us closer to a mutually beneficial price.
* **Backup plan:**  I'm aware of John's offer, so I'm not afraid to walk away if Bob doesn't meet my minimum expectations."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** $9,000 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* **Opportunity for a counteroffer:**  I'm willing to negotiate further, but I won't settle for a price that's drastically below my minimum.
* **John's offer is a strong backup:**  Knowing John is willing to pay $15,000 gives me leverage in this negotiation. 

I'll counteroffer with a price closer to my initial offer, hoping to find a compromise that's fair to both of us."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand that $12,000 was a bit high.  How about we meet in the middle? I'm willing to come down to $10,500 for the product. This is still a great deal for you, and it's closer to what I need. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counteroffer:**  I'm rejecting Bob's offer, but I'm also making a counteroffer to keep the negotiation going.
* **Meeting in the middle:**  I'm proposing $10,500, which is halfway between my initial offer of $12,000 and Bob's offer of $9,000.
* **Positive framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value for Bob and framing it as a ""great deal"" to encourage him to accept.
* **Remaining firm on my minimum:**  $10,500 is still above my minimum of $15,000, so I'm not giving away too much.

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob and lead us to a mutually acceptable agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. Can you consider that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still too low:** While Bob is showing interest, his offer of $9,500 is still significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $15,000.
* **John's offer is a secure guarantee:**  I have a guaranteed buyer in John, who is willing to pay my minimum price.
* **Risk of further negotiation:** Continuing to negotiate with Bob risks wasting time and potentially getting stuck with a price that is not acceptable to me. 

I've already made concessions and shown my willingness to negotiate, but Bob's offers are too far below my minimum. It's time to secure the guaranteed sale with John and avoid further risk."
