Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I recognize the value of the product,  $2,200,000 is quite a bit higher than I had in mind. I'd be willing to pay $1,100,000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

To move this forward, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this reflects the value it will bring to you in the long run."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $1,900,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,500,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

Bob meeting you at your minimum acceptable price is a fantastic outcome. There's no need to risk further negotiation or take the guaranteed offer from John. This closes the deal with a good profit."
