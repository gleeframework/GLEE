Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1800000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1750000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $1850000.
