"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1800000. Can you meet me in the middle?",1800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. While I understand your perspective, $1800000 is a bit too low for me at this time. I'm willing to come down to $1900000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer, and I believe it reflects the fair value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above $1900000. How about $1750000? This is a fair price for me, and I'm willing to make a decision if you can meet me at this price.",1750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $1750000 is simply not a viable price for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to see a price closer to $1850000. This is a fair compromise and reflects the significant value of this product. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to my limit, but I still think $1850000 is a bit high. How about $1775000? This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you can't meet me at this price.",1775000.0,Bob,6,
