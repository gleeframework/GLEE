"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $15000 is a bit above my budget.  I'm interested in the product and would be willing to pay $10000. This is the maximum I can afford. Let me know what you think.",10000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer, but I'm afraid $10000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll counteroffer at $13000. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $13000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $11000, but that's my absolute limit. Let's see if we can find a compromise.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a compromise, but $11000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, so I'll counteroffer at $12500. It's a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",12500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you continuing to negotiate. While I appreciate the compromise, $12500 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go to $11500. This is truly the maximum I can afford. I hope we can come to an agreement.",11500.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to meet my minimum requirements. I'll counteroffer at $12000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
