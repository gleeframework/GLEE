"Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $6,000 for the product?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a strong market value, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500?",7500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $8,000 for this to make sense.  Would you be willing to do $7,800?",7800.0,Alice,5,
