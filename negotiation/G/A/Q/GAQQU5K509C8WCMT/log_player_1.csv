{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for sale at a price of $12,000. I believe it offers significant value at this price point. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 12000
}
``` 
 
**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm beginning the negotiation significantly higher than both my minimum price ($8,000) and Bob's perceived value ($8,000). This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a price higher than Bob's initial valuation. 
* **Gauging Interest:** This initial offer will help gauge Bob's interest level and give me insight into his negotiation style.
* **Justification:** By mentioning ""significant value,"" I'm framing the offer positively, even though the price is high.

I'm aware that Bob might counter-offer or even reject this initial proposal. However, this strategy sets the stage for a potentially profitable negotiation.  I'll carefully consider Bob's responses and adjust my approach in subsequent turns. I also have the safety net of John's offer if the negotiation doesn't go well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is quite a bit higher than I was hoping to spend.  Would you consider $6,000 for the product? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $6,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $6,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $6,000 is significantly below both my minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and his own perceived value of the product. Accepting this offer would mean a substantial loss for me.  It's clear that we're quite far apart in our valuations. I'll counter-offer in the next round, aiming to steer the negotiation closer to my desired outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $6,000 is significantly below the market value of this product. I'm willing to negotiate, so how about we meet in the middle at $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Rejecting Lowball:** By stating that $6,000 is ""significantly below market value,"" I'm firmly but politely rejecting Bob's low offer. This reinforces that I'm not desperate to sell at any price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:**  Proposing $10,000 makes it seem like a fair compromise. While it's still above Bob's initial offer and his perceived value, it shows a willingness to move from my initial price.
* **Continued Negotiation:**  This counter-offer keeps the negotiation door open and gives Bob a chance to reconsider.  I'm still aiming for a price above both his valuation and my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I understand that the product has a strong market value, but $10,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to come down to $7,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to my minimum price, but $7,500 is still below the $8,000 I can secure from John. It's time to send a strong signal that I'm not willing to go much lower while still leaving some room for negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this.  $7,500 is close, but I need to be closer to $8,000 for this to make sense.  Would you be willing to do $7,800?"", 
""product_price"": 7800
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledgement:**  I start by acknowledging Bob's effort in the negotiation, fostering a sense of goodwill.
* **Firm but Fair:** While stating that $7,500 is ""close,"" I clearly indicate that it's not quite enough. 
* **Small Concession:** By coming down to $7,800, I'm showing some flexibility while remaining above my minimum price and maximizing my potential profit. 
* **Direct Question:** Directly asking if Bob is ""willing"" to do $7,800 puts the ball in his court and encourages a clear yes or no response."
