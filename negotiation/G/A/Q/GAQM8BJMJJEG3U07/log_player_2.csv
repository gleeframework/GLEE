"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product for a special price of $110. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love it! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While you could potentially get the product for cheaper by rejecting Alice's offer and trying to negotiate with John, there's no guarantee that will work.  

* **Accepting Alice's offer:** You get the product for $110, which is within your budget and a better price than John's.
* **Rejecting and buying from John:** You risk having to pay the full $120, which is closer to your maximum budget. 

It's a better strategy to secure the product at a price you're comfortable with, rather than risk a higher price."
