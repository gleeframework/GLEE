"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $12,000 to me, but considering its value to you, I'm willing to negotiate. Let's aim for a fair price. How about we start at $9,500?",9500.0,Alice,1,

"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer! However, I'm on a tight budget, and $9,500 is a bit steep for me. How about we bring it down to $6,500? I believe that's a fair price that considers both of our positions.",6500.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I appreciate your feedback. I understand your position, but I need to maintain a certain profit margin on this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway. My counteroffer is $7,500. I hope this aligns better with your budget while still allowing me to achieve my desired return.",7500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate you meeting me halfway. While $7,500 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm still aiming for a lower price point. Would you consider $7,000? That would be a comfortable price for me.",7000.0,Bob,4,

"I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try to find a common ground here. Considering your budget constraints and the value of the product to you, how about I offer $7,250? This is a bit higher than your last proposal, but it's also closer to my initial offer. I hope this helps us reach an agreement.",7250.0,Alice,5,
