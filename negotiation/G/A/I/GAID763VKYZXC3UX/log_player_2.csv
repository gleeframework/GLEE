# Alice's message: I have a unique opportunity for you to acquire a valuable product that I'm sure you'll find interesting. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000.

Alice's offer is below your maximum budget, but there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to potentially get a better price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're looking to pay $1,000,000, but I have to make a profit on this deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,300,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,300,000 is still below my maximum budget of $1,500,000 and represents a decent compromise.  While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk Alice will reject my counteroffer and I'll be forced to buy from John at a higher price."
