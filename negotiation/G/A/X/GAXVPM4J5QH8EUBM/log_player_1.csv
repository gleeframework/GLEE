{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's above your minimum acceptable price ($8,000) and leaves room for negotiation, appealing to Bob's potential savings while still allowing for a decent profit for you."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the price it's worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, it leaves no room for profit. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $9,000.  This still saves you a significant amount compared to what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you want to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I can go up to $9,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $9,500 is a good deal. It's above your minimum acceptable price and provides a decent profit. While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of losing the deal and having to sell to John for $8,000 isn't worth it."
