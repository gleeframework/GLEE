"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly less than what it's worth to you. What do you think?",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. That's the price it's worth to you, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $8,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can't go lower than $9,000.  This still saves you a significant amount compared to what the product is worth to you, and it allows me to make a fair profit. What do you say?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that you want to make a fair profit, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $9,000, but I can go up to $9,500. That's the maximum I'm willing to pay for the product.",9500.0,Bob,4,
