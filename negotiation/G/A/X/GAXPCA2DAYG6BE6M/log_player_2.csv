"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this unique product. Given its incredible value and potential, I'm confident it will be a worthwhile investment for you. I'm initially proposing a price of $1,600,000.  I believe this reflects the true value of the product, but I'm open to discussing a price that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is significantly higher than Bob's maximum budget of $1,000,000.  It's crucial to negotiate to try and get a better price.  There are still 9 rounds remaining, so rejecting the offer allows for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, your initial offer is a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm only able to offer $1,000,000 at this time. I'm hoping we can find a middle ground to make this deal work."", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. However,  $1,000,000 falls significantly short of the product's true value and potential. To move this forward, I can offer it to you for $1,450,000. This represents a significant reduction on my initial offer and demonstrates my willingness to find a fair agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her offer, it's still above Bob's budget.  There are still 7 rounds remaining, so it's worth continuing to negotiate and try to get a lower price."

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on your price.  While I'm interested, $1,450,000 is still a bit high for me.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to offer $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
