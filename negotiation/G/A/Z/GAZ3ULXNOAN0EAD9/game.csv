"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for you, considering its value to you is $1,000,000. Let's make this happen!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves you with a good margin, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I need to see some more movement. How about $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 simply isn't enough. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. What do you say?",775000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  Let's try $740,000 and see if we can close this out.",740000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $740,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $760,000.  This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account.  Let's finalize this deal now.",760000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice, we're almost there. I can do $750,000 and we can wrap this up today.",750000.0,Bob,8,
