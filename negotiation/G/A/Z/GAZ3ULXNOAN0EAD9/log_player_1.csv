"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, that's a bit steep for me. I'm willing to offer $600,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
Bob's offer is too low, and selling to John would yield a better profit. However, there are still 8 rounds remaining, and I want to see if I can negotiate a better price with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $600,000 is significantly lower than what I'm looking for. I'm willing to come down to $850,000. This still leaves you with a good margin, and it's a fair price for the value this product brings. Let's find common ground."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but I need to see some more movement. How about $700,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is better than Bob's previous offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. There are still 6 rounds left, and I'm hopeful that I can get closer to my desired price by continuing to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you. But $700,000 simply isn't enough. How about we split the difference and settle at $775,000? It's a fair price for both of us, and it ensures a smooth transaction. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, your willingness to compromise is appreciated.  Let's try $740,000 and see if we can close this out. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $740,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $740,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $740,000 is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, I believe I can still get a better deal with Bob. I'm confident that with a little more negotiation, we can reach a price that is mutually beneficial."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm glad we're making progress.  $740,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to go down to $760,000.  This is a fair price that takes both our needs into account.  Let's finalize this deal now."", ""product_price"": 760000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're almost there. I can do $750,000 and we can wrap this up today. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Although Bob is offering $750,000, which is closer to my minimum acceptable price, there are only two rounds remaining.  I don't want to risk getting stuck with a lower price.  Selling to John for $800,000 is a guaranteed profit and a safer option at this point."
