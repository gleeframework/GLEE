"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

I'm starting with a slightly higher price than what I believe the product is worth to Bob. This is a common negotiation tactic to see if he's willing to pay more than his perceived value. It also sets the stage for potential negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $11,000 is closer to my minimum, I believe I can still get a better price. I want to see if I can push him a little further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12000}
```

I'm offering the product at my minimum acceptable price. Since Bob is likely eager to buy the product, I believe he will accept this offer."
