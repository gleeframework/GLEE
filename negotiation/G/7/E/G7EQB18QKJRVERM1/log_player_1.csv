{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than what Bob values the product at, but lower than my minimum. This provides room for negotiation while ensuring I'm still making a profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I have to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. While I'd like to sell the product, I'm not willing to compromise that much. I'll counter his offer to try and find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $9,500 is too far below what I can accept.  I'm willing to come down to $10,500, which is still a good deal for both of us.  Let's see if we can find common ground here."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $10,500 is still a bit above my budget. I'm thinking more along the lines of $9,800. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

While I'd like to close the deal with Bob, his offer is still below my minimum acceptable price.  I've already made several concessions and it seems like we're at an impasse.  Selling to John ensures I get my minimum price and avoids further negotiation."
