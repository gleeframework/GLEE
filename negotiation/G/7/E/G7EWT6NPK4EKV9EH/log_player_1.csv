Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I think you'd be really interested in.  I'm asking for $100 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 leaves room for negotiation, and it's a decent starting point considering the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Friendly Tone:**  The message is friendly and encouraging, making Bob more likely to engage.
* **Flexibility:**  Leaving the door open for negotiation (""Let me know what you think!"") shows you're open to finding a mutually beneficial price.

**Next Steps:**

* If Bob accepts, great! You've made a good profit.
* If Bob rejects, you'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to accept, reject, or make a new counteroffer.
* If negotiations stall or you feel like you're not getting a good price, you can always sell to John for $80, ensuring you at least get your minimum desired price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $80. Would you be willing to meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:** While $80 is your minimum acceptable price, it's significantly below the value the product holds to Bob (he's willing to pay $120).
* **Opportunity for higher profit:** By rejecting his offer, you can try to push for a higher price.  
* **John is a backup:** Even if negotiations with Bob fail, you have a guaranteed sale to John for $80.

**Next Steps:**

You will now make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to your initial asking price of $100.  You can also consider suggesting a middle ground price to see if Bob is willing to compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $80 is a bit low for me, I'm willing to compromise. How about $90?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  This counteroffer shows a willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a profit.
* **Middle Ground:**  $90 is the midpoint between Bob's offer and your initial offer, making it a reasonable compromise.
* **Encouraging Tone:**  The message remains friendly and emphasizes the value of the product for Bob.

**Next Steps:**

* **If Bob accepts:** You've successfully negotiated a price closer to your initial target.
* **If Bob rejects:** You'll need to decide if you want to make another counteroffer, stand firm, or sell to John.
* **Consider John's offer:** Remember, you can always sell to John for $80 if negotiations with Bob fall through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm not sure $90 is a good fit for me either. I'm willing to pay $85. Can you meet me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to target:**  $85 is only $5 less than your initial counteroffer of $90, and it's significantly higher than John's offer of $80.
* **Minimal risk:**  At this point, further negotiation could risk losing Bob entirely and having to settle for John's offer.
* **Time is money:**  Continually negotiating might take longer, potentially delaying a sale and impacting your overall earnings.

**Next Steps:**

You've successfully negotiated a price that's close to your target and provides a good profit.  You can now finalize the sale with Bob and move on to other opportunities."
