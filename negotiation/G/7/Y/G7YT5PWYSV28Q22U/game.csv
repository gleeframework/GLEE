"Hi Bob, I'm offering my product for $120. It's in great condition and I'm sure you'll find it very valuable. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice. However, $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $90.  Let me know what you think.",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $90 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're trying to get a good price, but $110 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $95.  If you're serious about selling, let's meet in the middle.",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $95 is still below my minimum.  How about we split the difference at $102.50?  It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. ",102.5,Alice,5,
