"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. However, I'm interested in purchasing the product, but I think the price is a bit high. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,500,000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the market demand. I'm open to further negotiations, but I'd like to see some flexibility from your side. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,500,000 matches John's guaranteed offer, there's no incentive to engage in further negotiation.  

* **Guaranteed Sale:** John offers a sure $1,500,000. 
* **Negotiation Risk:** Continuing with Bob introduces uncertainty. He might not go higher, and even if he does, it might not be significantly more than John's offer.
* **Time Value:**  Closing the deal quickly with John avoids potentially lengthy negotiations with Bob. 

Therefore, it's strategically optimal to sell the product to John for the guaranteed price."
