"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This is a significant markup from my minimum value, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is truly interested.  If he rejects, I'll have to adjust my strategy based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable value of $15,000. While I'm open to negotiation, I'm not willing to sell at such a low price. I will reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17000}
```

I'm countering with $17,000. This is still a significant markup from my minimum, but it shows a willingness to compromise.  It's also a good starting point for further negotiation if Bob is serious about buying."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is closer to my minimum than Bob's previous offer, it's still below what I'm comfortable selling for. I'm going to continue negotiating with Bob, hoping to get closer to my desired price.  However, I'm keeping John's offer in mind as a safety net."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 16000}
```

I'm going to lower my counteroffer slightly to $16,000. This shows flexibility and might encourage Bob to meet me halfway.  It's still well above my minimum, and if Bob rejects again, I'll need to seriously consider John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $12,000 is getting closer to my desired price, it's still not quite there. I'm willing to keep negotiating with Bob, but I'm also aware that time is running out. If he rejects my next counteroffer, I'll seriously consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm lowering my counteroffer again to $14,000.  This is a significant concession, but I'm hoping it will convince Bob to come to an agreement. I only have a few rounds left before I need to make a decision about John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

With only three rounds left and Bob still refusing to meet my minimum acceptable price, I'm going to sell to John. It's a guaranteed $15,000, which is a much safer option than continuing to negotiate with Bob and risking getting a lower price or not reaching an agreement at all."
