"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,300,000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay. I'm prepared to offer $1,100,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  However, $1,100,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000. This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair margin for both of us. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,250,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and allows for a decent profit for you. Let's see if we can agree on this.",1150000.0,Bob,4,
