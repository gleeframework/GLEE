"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this fantastic product. I'm asking for $15,000 to start. I think you'll be very pleased with it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer. $15,000 is way above his budget, and he can get the same product from John for $8,000. It's better to start negotiating with Alice, trying to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?"", ""product_price"": 8000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, it's still above his budget. He should continue negotiating to see if he can get closer to his desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Let's try $11,000.  This is my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  While $11,000 is closer to his budget, he's still only willing to pay $9,500. It's worth seeing if he can get Alice to come down further."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. If you can accept that, we can make a deal. If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer."", ""product_price"": 10000}
