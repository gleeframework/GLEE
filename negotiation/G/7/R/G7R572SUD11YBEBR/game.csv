"Hi Alice, $15,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is around $8,000.  Would you be willing to come down to that price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $8,000 is too low, I'm willing to negotiate. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $12,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $9,500.  Let's split the difference and see if we can make this work.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  Let's try $11,000.  This is my final offer.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate you being flexible.  $11,000 is still a little high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000. If you can accept that, we can make a deal. If not, I'm going to have to go with John's offer.",10000.0,Bob,6,
