Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll really like. I'm asking for $95 for it. What do you say?"", 
""product_price"": 95
}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximizing Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $80, you can aim for a higher price with Bob. 
* **Reasonable Markup:**  A $15 markup is a common starting point in negotiations, and it doesn't price the product so high that it's immediately unreasonable to Bob.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This offer leaves space for Bob to counter-offer if he wants the product but finds the price a little high."
