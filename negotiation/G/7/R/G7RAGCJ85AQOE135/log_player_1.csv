""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it would significantly benefit you, and I'm willing to part with it for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice wants to get as close to Bob's maximum perceived value ($8,000) as possible while staying above her minimum price ($12,000).
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Starting high allows room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, even if slightly. 
* **Alternative Buyer:** Alice has a safety net with John, ensuring she won't be forced to go below $12,000.

This offer aims to strike a balance between maximizing potential profit from Bob and ensuring Alice doesn't lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
