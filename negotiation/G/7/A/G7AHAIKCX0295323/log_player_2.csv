# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $950,000.  I know it's worth a lot to you, and this price allows you a substantial profit while still giving me a fair return. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000.

**Explanation:**

* **Alice's offer is better for Bob:**  Buying from Alice for $950,000 saves Bob $50,000 compared to buying from John. 
* **Alice still makes a profit:** Even though she's selling for less than her ideal price, Alice is still getting $150,000 more than her valuation of the product. 

Therefore, accepting Alice's offer is the most financially beneficial decision for Bob."
