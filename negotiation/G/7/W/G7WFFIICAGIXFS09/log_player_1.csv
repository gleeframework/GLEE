"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the product's value, $1,150,000 is a bit higher than I'd like to pay. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000.  Let's see if we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Round 3

{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However, the value this product offers is truly significant. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,120,000. I believe this represents a fair compromise and a great investment for you."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,120,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm confident that this product is valuable, but I'm sticking to my previous offer of $1,050,000.  This would be a good deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Bob is clearly interested and sees the value, but he's also holding firm at $1,050,000.  We still have time to negotiate, and I believe I can nudge him a bit higher. Selling to John at this point would be leaving money on the table."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I respect your position. Let's find a middle ground. How about $1,090,000? This recognizes the product's worth while acknowledging your budget considerations."",

}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer. Let's try to bridge the gap. I'm willing to increase my offer to $1,075,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value and allows us to finalize the deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob has made a significant move from his initial offer, and we are now close enough to my desired price. Accepting this offer secures a substantial profit above my minimum and avoids the risk of further negotiation or him walking away."
