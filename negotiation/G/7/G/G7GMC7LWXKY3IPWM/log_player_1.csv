Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's closer to my value than Bob's. This gives me room to negotiate downwards.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm emphasizing a win-win scenario. This could encourage Bob to consider the offer more seriously.
* **Leaving Room for Counteroffers:** $1,000,000 is a reasonable starting point, but it's also above Bob's valuation. This allows for some back-and-forth negotiation. 

**Important Note:**  I'm keeping in mind that I can always sell to John for $1,200,000 if the negotiation with Bob falls through."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. It's a bit more in line with what I'm comfortable paying. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Higher Potential:** While $900,000 is a decent profit, I can likely do better with further negotiation. 
* **My Value:** My product is worth $1,200,000 to me, and I'm not desperate to sell.  
* **Room to Compromise:** There's still a gap between Bob's offer and my desired price. I believe I can push for a price closer to $1,000,000. 

**Next Steps:**

I will counter Bob's offer with a price closer to my initial offer. I will aim for a price that is both attractive to Bob and still profitable for me."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $950,000? That way, we both get a good deal."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm showing flexibility by meeting Bob halfway. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate and could make him more likely to accept.
* **Still Profitable:**  $950,000 is still a good profit for me, especially considering I have the option to sell to John for $1,200,000.
* **Staying Firm:**  I'm not willing to go much lower than $950,000.  This shows I'm confident in the value of the product. 

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response. If he rejects my counteroffer again, I'll need to decide whether to accept his offer or try to negotiate further, keeping in mind my potential sale to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit too high on the price. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:** Bob's offer of $925,000 is only $25,000 away from my counteroffer of $950,000. This is a very small difference.
* **Profitable:** $925,000 is still a very profitable sale for me.
* **Risk of John:** There's a risk that if I reject Bob and continue negotiating, Bob might walk away, leaving me with only the option of selling to John. 

**Conclusion:**

Considering the potential for further negotiations to be unsuccessful, accepting Bob's offer seems like the best strategy. It's a good price, and it avoids the risk of losing out on a sale altogether."
