"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,000,000 is fair. What do you think?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate the product's potential, $1,000,000 is outside my budget.  I'm willing to pay $700,000 for it. Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand your position, but $700,000 is quite a bit below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? This reflects the product's worth while still being a good deal for you.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $900,000 is still a bit too high. Let's meet in the middle at $800,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to reach an agreement quickly.",800000.0,Bob,4,
