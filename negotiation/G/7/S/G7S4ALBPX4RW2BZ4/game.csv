"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1,400,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000 for the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1300000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 just doesn't quite cut it for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle at $1,350,000. This price still gives you a significant advantage, and it allows me to make a fair profit.  Let's make this deal happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,
