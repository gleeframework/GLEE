"Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

You can get the product for $12,000 from John, so you have room to negotiate with Alice.  Rejecting the offer of $10,000 gives you a chance to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice values the product at $8,000, so a price of $9,000 is still a good deal for her. This counteroffer is also significantly lower than the $10,000 Alice initially offered, saving you $1,000. This leaves room for further negotiation if Alice rejects the offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $10,500 is lower than her initial offer, it's still higher than what you're willing to pay.  You can still get the product for less than $10,500 from John, so rejecting this offer gives you another opportunity to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate.  She's already come down from $10,000 to $10,500.  Offering $9,500 is a reasonable compromise that still gives you a good deal, and leaves some room for further negotiation if she rejects.  Remember, you can always get the product for $12,000 from John if things fall apart."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is closer to your maximum price point, you can still get the product for a lower price from John. Rejecting this offer allows you one more chance to negotiate with Alice and try to bring the price down further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been steadily lowering her price. It's likely she's getting closer to her limit as well.  Offering $10,000 is a compromise, only $500 lower than her last offer, but still saves you money compared to buying from John. It's a reasonable offer that could be the final step in reaching a deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has been consistently moving closer to her desired price point. This means she's unlikely to budge much lower.  At this point, buying from John for $12,000 guarantees you the product and saves you the time and effort of further negotiation."
