"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $20,000. This allows for negotiation room while still ensuring I get a price significantly higher than my minimum. I'll need to see how Bob responds to gauge his interest and adjust my strategy accordingly."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to settle just yet. I want to see if I can squeeze a bit more out of him.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm countering with $17,500. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer, showing flexibility while still leaving room for further negotiation. I'm hoping this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $16,000 is a good compromise. It's significantly more than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000 and leaves me a bit of profit. I'm willing to close the deal at this point, as further negotiation might risk losing the sale entirely."
