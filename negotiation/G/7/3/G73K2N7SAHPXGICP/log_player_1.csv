{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting at $1,150,000, which is significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. This gives me room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **Appealing to Bob's Value:** My message explicitly mentions the product's value to Bob, subtly reminding him that he's willing to pay more than my asking price.
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:**  $1,150,000 is still below Bob's maximum willingness to pay, leaving space for a counteroffer that might be more favorable to me.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:**  Great! I've achieved a good price.
* **Bob rejects:**  I'll carefully consider his counteroffer, aiming to get as close to $1,150,000 as possible. 
* **Deadlock:**  If negotiations stall, I'll have the option to sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less. Given the product's value to me, I'm willing to offer $1050000. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Counteroffer:**  Bob's offer of $1,050,000 is significantly lower than my initial offer of $1,150,000, and it's right at my minimum acceptable price. 
* **Negotiation Potential:**  While $1,050,000 is acceptable, I believe there's still room for negotiation to get closer to my desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  Selling to John immediately would guarantee $1,000,000, but there's a potential for a better deal with Bob. The risk is that the negotiation could break down and I might end up selling to John anyway.

**Next Steps:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $1,150,000. I'll consider a counteroffer of $1,100,000, leaving room for further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1,050,000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1,100,000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Splitting the Difference:** By offering $1,100,000, I'm proposing a compromise that's halfway between my initial offer of $1,150,000 and Bob's counteroffer of $1,050,000. This shows that I'm willing to be flexible and reach an agreement.
* **Maintaining Profit:**  $1,100,000 is still significantly above my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000, ensuring a reasonable profit for me. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** My message reiterates that the deal is still a good one for Bob, making him feel like he's getting a fair price.

**Next Steps:**

* **Bob accepts:** I've successfully negotiated a better price than my initial offer. 
* **Bob rejects:**  If Bob rejects this counteroffer, I'll have to decide whether to accept his next counteroffer, or sell to John for $1,000,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. Let's try $1075000. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm getting closer to where I need to be.  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to My Minimum:** Bob's offer of $1,075,000 is only $75,000 below my minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Potential for Further Negotiation:**  While I would prefer a higher price, continuing to negotiate might risk a deadlock and force me to sell to John for $1,000,000. 
* **Minimizing Risk:**  Accepting Bob's offer guarantees me a sale and a profit, even if it's not the maximum I could potentially get. 

**Next Steps:**

* I'll accept Bob's offer and secure the sale of the product."
