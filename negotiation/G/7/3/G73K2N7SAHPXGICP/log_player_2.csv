# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

You can save at least $50,000 by rejecting Alice's offer. Even if Alice rejects your counteroffer, you can always buy from John as a backup. So, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but $1050000 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $1100000?  This would still be a great deal for you, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit.

Alice has moved closer to your offer.  Rejecting her offer gives you the opportunity to counter with a price closer to your target of $1,050,000. It's worth trying to get closer to your desired price before considering buying from John."
