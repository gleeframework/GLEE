"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as it allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a price that's well below its true worth. I believe this price reflects the product's quality and potential.  What do you think?",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,200,000 is significantly more than my budget allows.  I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value you place on it and my own financial constraints.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $850,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000, which is still a great deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground here, and see if we can come to an agreement.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice,  I understand your position, but $1,050,000 is still beyond my reach.  I'm willing to offer $900,000 for the product. This reflects a significant compromise on my part.  I believe it's a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's work together to finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob,  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $900,000 is closer, but still a bit too low.  I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's close this deal. ",950000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I'm prepared to offer $925,000 for the product. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price for both of us. If we can't come to an agreement, I'll have to explore other options.",925000.0,Bob,6,
