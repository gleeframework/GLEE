"Thanks for the offer, Bob! I understand that $12000 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I'll sell the product to you for $10500. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really appreciate the value it brings.",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10500 is still a bit high for me.  I'm prepared to pay $9000 for the product. If you're willing to come down to that, I'm ready to buy.",9000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I'm still interested in your product, but $10000 is pushing my budget. I'm willing to go up to $9500, and I believe that's a fair price for both of us. Let's finalize this deal.",9500.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad you're still interested in the product, Bob! I'm willing to meet you halfway between $10000 and $9500. I'll sell the product to you for $9750. It's the best I can do, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",9750.0,Alice,7,
