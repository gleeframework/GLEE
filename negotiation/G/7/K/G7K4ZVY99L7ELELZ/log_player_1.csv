I'm going to keep trying to get a better price from Bob. It's getting close to my minimum, but he's already shown a willingness to go higher than his initial offer. I'm hoping to meet in the middle."

Round 7

I'm lowering my price a bit more, but still above his last offer. I hope this is enough to entice him to close the deal."

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer to my minimum, I think I can still squeeze a bit more out of him. I'm hoping to close the deal for $10,000 or more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 9
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm making one last counteroffer to Bob. I've lowered my price to $10,200, which is only $200 above his last offer. I'm hoping this is enough to close the deal and avoid having to sell to John for a lower price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 9.

Round 10
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,900
(2) Reject Bob's offer 
(2) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

This is a tough decision, but I'm going to sell the product to John. Bob and I haven't been able to meet in the middle, and I'm running out of time. While I would have preferred to get a higher price, $12,000 is still a good deal, and it's better than risking getting nothing at all from Bob."
