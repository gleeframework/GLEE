"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit too high for my budget. I'd be willing to pay $6,000 for it. What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking to save some money, but I'm not willing to go as low as $6,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000? I think it's a fair price for this amazing product.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you trying to find a middle ground.  However, $9,000 is still a bit too steep for me.  Would you consider $7,000?  That's a firm offer on my end.",7000.0,Bob,4,
