"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. I think it's a fair price considering its value. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You should reject Alice's offer. You are willing to pay up to $10,000 and Alice's offer is higher.  It makes more sense to counter-offer and try to negotiate a better price before buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $11,500 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position. While $10,500 is still a bit low for me, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is my final offer, let me know if you're interested. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

Alice's offer of $11,000 is still higher than your maximum budget of $10,000.  You're better off buying the product from John for $10,000."
