``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still in the early stages of negotiation, and Bob is consistently moving closer to our desired price range. It's worth pushing a bit further to see if we can secure a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that.  How about we split the difference?  I'm willing to come down to $870,000, making this my final offer."",
""product_price"": 870000
}
```

**Reasoning:** We're now getting closer to the later stages of negotiation, so it's strategic to signal some firmness in our position. By stating this is our final offer and offering a smaller concession, we increase the pressure on Bob to accept while still aiming for a price above our fallback option."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence. I am willing to pay $862,500 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $862,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $862,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:** Bob is incrementally increasing his offer, but it's becoming clear he's unlikely to meet our desired price.  Accepting his offer of $862,500 secures a significant profit above our $800,000 alternative and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds."
