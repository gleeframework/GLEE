"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a great deal for you, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you think?",10500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're eager to get this product, but $9,750 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try $10,000. That's a fair price for both of us, and it would allow me to move forward with the sale. What do you say?",10000.0,Alice,5,
