Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **My Minimum:** I value the product at $1,000,000. 
* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $800,000.
* **John's Value:** John values the product at $1,000,000.

By offering the product at $900,000, I'm:

* **Maximizing my profit:** I'm getting closer to my desired price of $1,000,000.
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Bob may be willing to pay a little more, as he values the product at $800,000. 
* **Securing a fallback option:**  If Bob rejects the offer, I can still sell the product to John for $1,000,000.

This offer balances the risk of rejection with the potential for higher profit."
