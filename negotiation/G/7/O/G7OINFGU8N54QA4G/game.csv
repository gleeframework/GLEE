"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product. It's valued at over $1.5 million to me, but I'm willing to start the conversation at $1,450,000.  This price reflects a significant discount and a great opportunity for you. What do you think?",1450000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I recognize the value of the product, that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to consider a price closer to $1,100,000. What do you think?",1100000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective.  $1,100,000 is simply too low for me to consider. However, I'm open to finding a solution that works for both of us.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This price still allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount while giving me a fair return on my investment.",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me. $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $1,175,000?  That's a significant move on my end.",1175000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,175,000 is simply not a feasible number for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,250,000,  which is a significant concession on my end. This price represents a fair compromise and allows you to acquire the product at a substantial discount. Let's make this deal happen.",1250000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, we're getting closer. I appreciate your willingness to work with me. Would you be open to $1,210,000? I'm trying to make this work within my budget.",1210000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I see we're getting closer.  While $1,210,000 is a good offer, I'm still needing a bit more to make this deal work for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $1,230,000. This represents a reasonable compromise and allows both of us to walk away happy.  What do you say?",1230000.0,Alice,7,
