"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,300,000 is fair.  What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Anchor:** I'm starting with a high anchor price significantly above my minimum ($1,500,000) and Bob's perceived value ($800,000). This creates room for negotiation and potentially influences Bob's perception of the product's value.
* **Justification:**  By highlighting the ""unique value and potential,"" I'm subtly justifying the high price without revealing my true bottom line. 
* **Open to Discussion:** I want to understand Bob's perspective and gauge his interest, so I'm phrasing it as a starting point for discussion.

It's important to note that while I have the option to sell to John for my minimum, my goal is to maximize profit. I'll use these initial rounds to assess Bob's willingness to pay a premium before considering that option."

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, but I'm afraid $2,300,000 is above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,800,000 for the product, which I believe is a fair price considering its value. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer of $1,800,000 is significantly closer to my minimum, it's still substantially higher than his perceived value. This indicates there's room for further negotiation. I'm willing to counter in hopes of reaching a price point closer to $2,000,000. 

Selling to John for $1,500,000 guarantees my minimum but would mean leaving potential profit on the table. I'll explore pushing the negotiation with Bob a bit further before making that decision."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer and for engaging in the negotiation. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to be flexible.  To be fair to both of us, I could consider a price of $2,100,000. This reflects the true value and the potential this product holds.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Concession with Justification:** I'm making a significant concession from my initial price but anchoring it to the ""true value"" to justify the price point. 
* **Testing the Waters:**  This counteroffer aims to gauge Bob's flexibility. If he's unwilling to budge much from $1,800,000, it might be time to consider John's offer. However, if he's open to moving closer to $2,000,000, a deal is still within reach. 
* **Positive Tone:** I'm maintaining a positive and collaborative tone to foster a good negotiating environment."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to be flexible, but $2,100,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,600,000 for the product, which I believe is a more reasonable price considering the market value. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's counteroffer of $1,600,000 is too close to John's standing offer of $1,500,000.  While there might be a slight possibility of negotiating Bob a bit higher, it's unlikely to be a significant difference. 

At this point, the risk of continuing the negotiation with Bob outweighs the potential reward:

* **Time:** Further negotiation with Bob will consume more time, with no guarantee of a significantly better offer.
* **Certainty:**  John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, providing immediate closure and minimizing uncertainty.

Therefore, it makes the most strategic sense to accept John's offer and secure the $1,500,000."
