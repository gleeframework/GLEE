"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I'm willing to negotiate further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer Alice.  While I agree it's a great product, $800000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to pay $950000, which is still a great deal for both of us.  Let's find a way to make this work.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your perspective, and I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $900000. This is a significant compromise, but I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. I'm open to further negotiations, but I want to emphasize that I'm not willing to go any lower than this.",900000.0,Alice,3,
