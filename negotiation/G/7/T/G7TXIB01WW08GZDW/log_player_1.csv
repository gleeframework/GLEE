```

This is a tricky situation.  While Bob is offering close to my desired price, this is my last round with him. If I reject his offer, there is no guarantee that he will come back with a better one. Selling to John guarantees me $800,000, which is my minimum acceptable price. It's not ideal, but it's better than risking getting nothing."
