"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. Can you consider that?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and the counteroffer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $900000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm happy to meet you in the middle. How about $1050000? This still leaves a good margin for you and gets us closer to a deal.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to meet me in the middle. However, I'm still a bit above my target price. Would you be willing to go as low as $950000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal possible.  However, $950000 is still quite a bit lower than what I need to make this worthwhile.  I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1000000.  Let's close this deal, as this price still provides you with significant value.",1000000.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and I'm getting closer to a deal that works for both of us. While I'm happy to be flexible, $980000 is still a bit below my minimum. How about $990000? This would be a great price for you and will enable us to finalize the deal.",990000.0,Alice,7,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best price, but $980000 is still a bit too low for me.  We've been going back and forth, and it's time to reach a compromise. Let's agree on $985000. This is a fair price for both of us, and will allow us to finalize the deal.  What do you say?",985000.0,Alice,9,
