Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1200000} 
```

This offer starts the negotiation at a price that's significantly higher than your minimum, but still leaves room for Bob to potentially make a counteroffer that's more favorable to both of us.  I'm confident that Bob will see the value in this product and will be willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json

Bob's offer is getting closer, but it's still below what I believe is fair. I'm going to counter with a price closer to my initial offer and see if we can reach an agreement."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

I'm willing to come down a bit, but I still need to make sure I get a fair price for the product.  I believe $1,150,000 is a fair compromise, and I hope Bob sees it the same way."

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price yet.  I'm going to counter with a price slightly higher and see if we can reach an agreement."

I'm willing to meet Bob halfway at $1,100,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and I hope we can reach a deal."

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,020,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,020,000

Bob's offer is still too low, and I'm getting tired of this back and forth.  I'm going to take John's offer and move on.  It's not my ideal price, but it's better than continuing to negotiate with Bob."
