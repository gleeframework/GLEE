"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but unfortunately, $1,400,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit from my initial offer, though. How about $1,600,000? I believe this is a fair price that still allows for a good deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I am still seeking to keep the cost lower. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,550,000.
