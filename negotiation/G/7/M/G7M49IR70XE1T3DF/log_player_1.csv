Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value, and I'm confident it will be highly beneficial for you. I'm asking for $15,000. What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 15000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always best to start negotiations higher than your minimum acceptable price. This gives you room to negotiate and still reach a price you're happy with. 
* **Gauging Interest:**  By offering a price significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, we can gauge his level of interest and potential to negotiate. 
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $12,000 with John, so there's no risk in aiming higher with Bob.

**Possible Outcomes:**

* **Bob accepts:** We get a great deal at $15,000.
* **Bob negotiates:** We have room to lower the price and still make a profit above our minimum.
* **Bob rejects:** We proceed with selling to John for our guaranteed $12,000."
