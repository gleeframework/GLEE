"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm interested in the product, but $1,200,000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $900,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and your counteroffer. However, $900,000 is a bit too low for me. Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,050,000. This price still offers you a good deal, considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you need to make a profit, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $950,000.  This is a fair price for both of us and would allow us to close this deal. What do you say?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $950,000 is still below what I need.  Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product for you, and it allows me to achieve my desired profit margin.  What do you say?",1000000.0,Alice,5,
