"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire something that will bring you significant value. I'm willing to start with an offer of $12,000 for the product. Let me know if you're interested!",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I think that's as low as I can go.",9000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm afraid $9,000 is still a bit lower than I was hoping for. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. I'm going to counter with $11,000. Let me know if that's something you'd be interested in.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand where you're coming from, Alice, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go above $9,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider $9,750?",9750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway again, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $9,750 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm willing to consider your offer, but I need to think about it. Let me make a counteroffer of $11,250. I'm trying to find a sweet spot that works for both of us. What do you think?",11250.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, but I'm still not comfortable going above $9,750. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I think that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to consider $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to make another concession, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $10,000 is enough to justify the value of the product. I'm starting to think that we might be getting close to a deal, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. Let me make a counteroffer of $12,000. I'm trying to find a price that works for both of us. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit frustrated, Alice. I've made several concessions and I'm not willing to go above $10,000. I think we're getting close to the limit of what I'm willing to pay. Would you be willing to meet me at $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're getting frustrated, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to continue negotiating. However, I'm still not willing to meet you at $10,500. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a price that reflects the value of the product. Let me make a counteroffer of $12,500. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I hope we can finally reach a deal.",12500.0,Alice,9,
