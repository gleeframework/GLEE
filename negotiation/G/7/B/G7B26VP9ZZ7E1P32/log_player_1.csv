"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""product_price"": 1750000} 

I'm starting high, aiming for a good deal. I know Bob values the product, but I'm also aware of John's offer, so I need to make sure I get a price that's closer to my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is way too low.  I need to get closer to my minimum of $1,500,000. I'll counteroffer and see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000}
```

I'm lowering my price a bit, but still aiming for a price that's closer to my minimum.  This should hopefully encourage Bob to come up with a better offer in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is a bit closer, it's still not acceptable.  I'm willing to keep negotiating, as I believe I can secure a better price.  I'm also aware of John's offer, but I'm not ready to sell to him just yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm offering my minimum price. If Bob doesn't accept, I'm confident that John will, so I'm not willing to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and we're already at round 6.  It's risky to keep negotiating, as we only have a few rounds left and John is always a possibility. $1,400,000 is a good compromise, and I can still make a decent profit."
