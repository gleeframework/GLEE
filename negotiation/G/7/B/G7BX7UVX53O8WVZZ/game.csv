"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. I'd be willing to purchase it for $600,000. Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?",900000.0,Alice,3,
