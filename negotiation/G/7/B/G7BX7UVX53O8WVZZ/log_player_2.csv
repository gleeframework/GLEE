# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a valuable asset. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $800,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your interest in the product. However, I'm afraid I can't accept your offer of $600,000. Considering the product's value to you is $800,000, I'm willing to make a counteroffer. I'm thinking of a price of $900,000. This is a compromise that still reflects the product's value to you, while also being more reasonable than my initial offer. What do you think?

Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and it's not worth risking a higher counteroffer.  Buying from John at $800,000 ensures you get the product at your maximum price."
