"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product. I think it would be perfect for you and I'm willing to part with it for $15,000. What do you think?",15000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit too steep for me.  I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $6,000 for it.  What do you think?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $6,000 is too low, I'm willing to be flexible to make a deal. How about we meet in the middle at $10,500?",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. However, $10,500 is still a bit high for my budget.  Could we possibly settle on $7,000? That would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",7000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I need to get a fair price for this product.  $9,000 is my final offer - it's a significant discount and a great deal for you.",9000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for sticking with this. I know we both want to reach a deal here.  $9,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $7,500. Would you be willing to meet me there?",7500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, this is really my bottom line.  I can do $8,500, but that's the absolute lowest I can go. It's a fantastic price for what you're getting.",8500.0,Alice,7,
