"Hi Alice, I appreciate you offering this product to me. While I recognize its value, $16000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $14500 for it.  Let me know if that's something you're open to discussing.",14500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm happy to work with you.  $14500 is a bit low for me though, considering what this product is worth.  How about we split the difference and I offer it to you for $15250?  Let's see if we can make this work.",15250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $15250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $14750. It's closer to your price, and I hope we can find a solution that works for both of us.",14750.0,Bob,4,
