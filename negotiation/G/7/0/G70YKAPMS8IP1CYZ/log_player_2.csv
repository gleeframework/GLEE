# Alice's message: Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. Given its value and potential, I believe a starting price of $2,000,000 is fair. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $2,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $2,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $1,000,000. There's no point in accepting it.  You should reject her offer and see if you can negotiate a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective, but the product's inherent value and potential warrant a higher price. I'm willing to come down to $1,800,000. This offer reflects the true worth of what's being offered.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still too high.  While it's lower than her initial offer, it's still beyond your budget.  Rejecting her offer and making a counteroffer is the best course of action to try and drive the price down further."
