"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate the opportunity to consider this product.  While I'm interested, $90 is a bit higher than my budget.  I'd be happy to pay $85 for it. What do you think?",85.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your honesty about your budget. I'm willing to consider a lower price, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair value for my product. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $90 and $85. How about $87.50?",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks again for being flexible.  $87.50 is still a little more than I was hoping for. I'm willing to go up to $86.  Let's see if we can close the deal at that price.",86.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. I'm still not willing to go as low as $86, but I'm willing to consider another compromise. How about $88? It's still a bit higher than your original offer, but I think it's a fair price for the value my product brings.",88.0,Alice,5,
