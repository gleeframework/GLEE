"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this incredible opportunity to acquire a unique product. I believe it has the potential to bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $950,000. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob should reject the offer.  $950,000 is still above his maximum budget. He can try to negotiate a better price with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I recognize the potential value of this product, $950,000 is unfortunately beyond my budget. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it.  This reflects the value I see in the product while remaining within my financial limits."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your budget constraints, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I'm now offering the product to you for $900,000. This is a significant concession on my part, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it is a concession from her previous offer, $900,000 is still above his budget. He should continue to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $900,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm prepared to pay $875,000 for the product, which represents a fair compromise between our positions.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close to a deal, Bob. However, $875,000 is still a bit below my target. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm now offering the product to you for $925,000. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

Bob should choose to buy from John.  While Alice has come down in price, she's still above Bob's maximum budget. At this point, it's unlikely that Alice will go lower, and Bob has already had several rounds of negotiations. Buying from John is the most logical choice to ensure he gets the product within his budget."
