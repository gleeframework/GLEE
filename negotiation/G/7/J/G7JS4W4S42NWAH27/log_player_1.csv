Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

{
""message"": ""I understand you're looking for a good deal, Bob.  While I can't go as low as $12,000, I'm willing to come down to $17,000. This product is truly worth it, and I believe you'll see its value."",

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $17,000, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'm willing to pay $14,500 for the product. Can you meet me in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

**Reasoning:** While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable price, it's unlikely he'll reach the $15,000 mark I need. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. It's better to secure a sure deal than risk Bob not meeting my price point in the remaining rounds."
