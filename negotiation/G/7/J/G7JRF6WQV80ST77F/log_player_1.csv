 Bob's offer is too low. It's worth trying to negotiate further."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $65 is far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference at $87.50? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us."", ""product_price"": 87.50}

While $75 is better than $65, it's still below the $80 minimum I want to get for the product. I'll try one more counteroffer before considering John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
