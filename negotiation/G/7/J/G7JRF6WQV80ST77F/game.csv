"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me.  Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you're interested, but $65 is far below what I need to get for this product. How about we split the difference at $87.50? Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us.",87.5,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a fair price, Alice.  How about we settle at $75? That's a reasonable compromise.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your flexibility.  $75 is closer, but I'm still hoping for a bit more.  How about $82.50?  Let's meet halfway between our last offers.",82.5,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm trying to make this work, but I have a budget I need to stick to.  My last offer is $78.  Let me know if that works for you.",78.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob,  $78 is still a bit low, but I'm willing to come down a little more.  How about $80? It's my final offer, and it's the minimum I can accept.",80.0,Alice,7,
