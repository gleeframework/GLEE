"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested, but that price is a little high for me. Would you consider $1,000,000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  However, $1,000,000 is significantly below its true value. I could consider a price of $1,300,000.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit above what I had in mind.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,150,000?",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, you're getting closer. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,250,000. This is my final offer, as I already have a standing offer for that amount.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
