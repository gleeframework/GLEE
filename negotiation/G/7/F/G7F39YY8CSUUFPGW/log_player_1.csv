Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a fantastic opportunity, and I believe it will be extremely valuable to you. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. This reflects my current budget and the value I see in this item. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $750,000 is a decent amount, I believe I can get closer to my desired price point.  I'll try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $750,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my asking price. How about $900,000? This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my offer, but $900000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $800000. This is a fair price considering the potential value of the product and our negotiation process. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer of $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price. It's a good deal for me, and it avoids any further risk of him rejecting my offers or potentially losing the deal altogether."
