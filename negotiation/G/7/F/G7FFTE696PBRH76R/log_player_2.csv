"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this valuable product from me. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As such, I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a one-time offer, and I'm not sure I'll be able to match this price in the future. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

It's worth trying to negotiate a lower price with Alice.  You can save $50,000 by doing so."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand you're looking for a better price, but I'm still very confident in the value of this product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price considering the product's worth to you, and I'm not sure I can go any lower. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.

``` 

Alice's offer of $900,000 is a good deal. It's $100,000 less than what John is selling it for, and it's within your budget.  There's no need to risk a further negotiation that might lead to her rejecting your offer and leaving you with no choice but to buy from John at the full price."
