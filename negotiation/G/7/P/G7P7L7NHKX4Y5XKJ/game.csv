"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we discuss the price, I want to start with a competitive offer of $800,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is much higher. What do you think?",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your enthusiasm and the potential of this product, $800,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage. I'm willing to offer $650,000 for it. This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. Let's see if we can find common ground.",650000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. Considering the product's true value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,100,000. This is a fair compromise, taking into account your budget and the product's worth. What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $1,100,000 is closer, it's still above my target.  Let's split the difference. I'm offering $900,000 for the product. This price is fair, considering both our positions. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your desire to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $900,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. I'm proposing a counteroffer of $1,050,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the product's worth and our previous discussions. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,5,
