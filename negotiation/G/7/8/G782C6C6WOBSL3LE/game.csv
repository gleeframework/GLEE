"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! While I appreciate the product, $9,500 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. I'd be happy to pay $8,500 for it. What do you think?",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for the counteroffer. I appreciate your interest!  I'm willing to come down a bit, but $8,500 is still a little too low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $9,000?  Let me know what you think.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $9,000 is still a little higher than my budget. I'm sticking with my previous offer of $8,500.  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can come to an agreement.",8500.0,Bob,4,
