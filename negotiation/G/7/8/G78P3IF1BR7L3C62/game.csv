"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose we start with a price of $1,300,000. This is a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth to us and your perceived value, aiming for mutual satisfaction. Let me know what you think.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1,150,000 at this time. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us.",1150000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While it's challenging to meet exactly in the middle, I'd like to offer a compromise. How about we consider a price of $1,200,000? This proposal aims to be closer to the value you see in the product while still reflecting its worth to us. I hope this suggestion will be more favorable to you.",1200000.0,Alice,3,
