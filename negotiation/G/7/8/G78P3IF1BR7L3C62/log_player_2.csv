"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to present our product to you. It's an exceptional opportunity that could significantly benefit your business. Given its value to you, I propose we start with a price of $1,300,000. This is a strategic midpoint between its intrinsic worth to us and your perceived value, aiming for mutual satisfaction. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is above your budget:**  You're aiming to spend no more than $1,200,000.
* **Negotiation potential:** There's room for negotiation since Alice values the product at $1,500,000 and you're willing to pay up to $1,200,000. 
* **Potential to save money:** Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to counter-offer and potentially get a better price.

**Next Steps:**  You will need to make a counteroffer to Alice.  A good starting point might be around $1,100,000 to $1,150,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer. However,  $1,300,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in your product, but I'm only able to offer $1,150,000 at this time. This reflects the value I place on the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 1150000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your position and appreciate your interest in our product. While it's challenging to meet exactly in the middle, I'd like to offer a compromise. How about we consider a price of $1,200,000? This proposal aims to be closer to the value you see in the product while still reflecting its worth to us. I hope this suggestion will be more favorable to you.

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer meets your budget:**  Alice has now offered $1,200,000, which is your maximum price.
* **No further savings:** There's no potential to save more money by continuing to negotiate.  John is offering the same price. 
* **Efficient choice:** Accepting Alice's offer avoids the further negotiation and time involved in counteroffers. 

You are getting the product at your maximum price, so it's a good outcome."
