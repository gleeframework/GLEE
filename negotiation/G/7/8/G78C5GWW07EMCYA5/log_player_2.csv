Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I understand that $1,000,000 is a significant concession, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price.

It's clear Alice is unlikely to go below $1,075,000. Since you have the option to buy from John for $1,000,000, it makes more sense to take that guaranteed deal."
