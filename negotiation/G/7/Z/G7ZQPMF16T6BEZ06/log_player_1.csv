Send your offer to Bob.,"I'll make an offer to Bob. Since the product is worth $15,000 to him, I'll try to get as close to that as possible. Here's my initial offer:

{""product_price"": 14000}

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. Let's see if he accepts or makes a counteroffer!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","Bob rejected my initial offer, and now he's made a counteroffer of $12,500. Since this is lower than my initial offer, I'll decide to reject his offer and proceed to the next round. I'll make a new counteroffer to try to get closer to the product's true value to Bob.
