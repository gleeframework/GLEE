"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it. As we're just starting our conversation, I'd like to make an opening offer of $1,100,000. This is a competitive price considering the product's value to you.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. While I agree your product is valuable, that price is a bit high for me. I would be willing to purchase the product for $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we settle at $900,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",925000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, and I respect that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $912,500?  This is a fair compromise for both of us.",912500.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that $912,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to be careful. I'm willing to sell the product for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",915000.0,Alice,7,
