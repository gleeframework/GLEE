# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer and I'm confident you'll love it.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to part with the product at that price. Considering our conversation, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a compromise that works for both of us.

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $900,000 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already compromised by meeting you halfway in the previous round. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to sell the product for $925,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $925,000

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I understand this is your lowest price, and I respect that.  However, I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you be willing to meet me in the middle at $912,500?  This is a fair compromise for both of us."", ""product_price"": 912500}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $912,500 is a good offer, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I've already made significant concessions, and I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. I'm willing to make another small concession, but I need to be careful. I'm willing to sell the product for $915,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $915,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $915,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower.  Continuing to negotiate might push her away or run out the clock, forcing you to buy from John at full price.  $915,000 is a decent price, even if it's not the absolute lowest you could theoretically get."
