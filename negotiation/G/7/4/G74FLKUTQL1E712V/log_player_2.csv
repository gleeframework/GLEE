"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this item for sale at $130. I believe it offers excellent value at this price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

You can get a better price than $130, so rejecting Alice's offer is the best choice. You can counteroffer and potentially save even more money."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Alice, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $115? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 115}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $115 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $122? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $122. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $122
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice's offer of $122 is a good deal for you. It's within your budget and lower than what John is selling it for. Accepting her offer is the best choice in this situation."
