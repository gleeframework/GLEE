,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $90 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $70. Is that something you'd be willing to consider?",70.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $90 might be a bit too high for you, Bob. However, I'm still willing to negotiate. I can meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm still willing to work with you, Bob. However, I need to make a profit, so I can't go as low as $75. I can offer you the product for $80.50. That's my final offer. What do you think?",80.5,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer

,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I'm getting a bit frustrated with the back-and-forth, but I'm still willing to negotiate. I'll meet you at $79.50, but I need you to come down to $77.50 for me to accept. Can you meet me at this price?",77.5,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
