"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $120 is better than Alice's initial value of $150, it's still above Bob's maximum of $80.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming for his maximum price point of $80. This counteroffer establishes his limit and sets the stage for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $110 is closer to Bob's goal, it's still above his maximum. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target. There's still room for Alice to come down further, and Bob can maintain the pressure by rejecting this offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 90} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a middle ground.  $90 is a compromise between his target of $80 and Alice's last offer of $110. This demonstrates a willingness to negotiate while still staying within a range Bob is comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $105
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $105 is closer to Bob's target than previous offers, it's still above his limit.  There are still rounds left, so rejecting the offer allows Bob to continue negotiating and potentially reach a price closer to his target of $80."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 95} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is inching closer to his target while staying within a reasonable negotiation range.  $95 is a compromise between his previous offer of $90 and Alice's last offer of $105. This continues to demonstrate Bob's willingness to negotiate while maintaining his commitment to a price closer to his target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still committed to getting the best possible price. While $100 is tempting, it's still above his target of $80. With several rounds left, it's worth continuing to negotiate to see if he can push Alice lower. There's a good chance she might be willing to come down further to avoid losing the sale."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 98} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push, aiming for a price just below Alice's last offer. $98 shows a willingness to compromise but also highlights Bob's firm stance on his budget. This approach might encourage Alice to accept, rather than risk losing the deal altogether. If Alice rejects, Bob might have to consider buying from John in the next round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 8.

Round 9
Alice's offer: The product price will be $102. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $102
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is running out of time.  While $102 is closer to his target than previous offers, there's only one round left.  He's unlikely to get Alice to drop to his target price of $80 within that single round. Therefore, it's more advantageous for Bob to buy the product from John for $80, ensuring he gets the product at his desired price point."
