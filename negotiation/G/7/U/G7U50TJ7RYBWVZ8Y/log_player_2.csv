"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hey Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth a lot to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $120.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's price is better than John's:**  $120 is significantly lower than $150.
* **You're still getting a good deal:** Even at $120, you're saving $30 compared to John's price, and you're still getting the product for less than your maximum value of $150."
