"I'm excited to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase this high-quality product. I believe it's a great fit for you, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to start with a price of $12,000, which is a fair value considering the product's worth to you is $8,000.",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. However, $12,000 is above my budget. I'm very interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $8,500 at this time. This reflects the value I place on the product and is a fair starting point for negotiation. Let's see if we can find common ground.",8500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your offer, Bob, and I'm glad you're interested in the product. However, I was hoping we could meet in the middle. Considering the product's value to you is $8,000, I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I believe it's a good compromise.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $11,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $9,000,  which represents a significant compromise on my part. I'm confident this is a fair offer that reflects the value of the product and allows us both to reach an agreement.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $9,000. Considering the value you place on the product, I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price that still reflects the product's worth to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",10500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $10,500 is still above what I can comfortably afford. I'm sticking to my offer of $9,000.  It's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product.  Let's make a deal and avoid wasting any more time.",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand you're firm on $9,000, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable with that price. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $10,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is a fair price considering the product's value to me, and I'm hoping we can finalize the deal at this point.",10000.0,Alice,7,
