"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you this product for $18,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 18000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $14,000. I believe it's a fair price considering the market value. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum value, I believe I can still negotiate a higher price.  I'm willing to risk a few more rounds to see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but $14,000 doesn't quite cover my costs. How about we split the difference and settle on $16,000?  It's a fair price that reflects the value of the product."", ""product_price"": 16000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that you have costs to consider, but I'm still not comfortable with $16,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so how about we discuss $15,500? I think that's a fair price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $15,500 is only $500 less than what I would get from John. It's a fair compromise, and I don't want to risk losing the deal with Bob and ending up with John's lower price. It's better to secure a deal that's close to my desired price than to gamble with further negotiation."
