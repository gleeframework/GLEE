"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",11000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us.",12000.0,Alice,3,
