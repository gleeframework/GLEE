Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product that I believe will be very valuable to you. I'm offering it to you for $13,000, which is a fair price considering its worth.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is a good starting point that leaves room for negotiation.
* **Fairness:**  I'm emphasizing that the price is ""fair"" to encourage Bob to seriously consider the offer.
* **Value to Bob:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value to him, implicitly implying he'd be getting a good deal.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully evaluate Bob's response:

* **If he accepts:**  Great!  I've achieved a good outcome.
* **If he rejects:** I'll analyze his counteroffer and see if it's worth negotiating further.  I'll also consider how far I'm willing to go before accepting John's offer of $10,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  $13,000 is a bit more than I'd like to spend right now.  I'd be willing to pay $11,000 for the product.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is below my minimum:**  $11,000 is below my minimum acceptable price of $10,000. 
* **Negotiation potential:**  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, but I'll need to make a counteroffer that is more favorable to me. 
* **John's offer as a safety net:**  I have John's offer of $10,000 as a fallback option.

**Next Steps:**

I'll make a counteroffer to Bob, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer of $13,000.  I'll consider the following factors:

* **Bob's willingness to negotiate:**  How much bargaining room does Bob have?
* **My risk tolerance:**  How comfortable am I with the possibility that Bob might reject my counteroffer, leading me to have to accept John's offer?"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is a little too low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $12,000?  It's a fair price considering the product's value to you, and it's still a good deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 12000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference:**  Offering $12,000 is a compromise that shows I'm willing to be flexible.
* **Focus on Mutual Benefit:**  I emphasize the ""fairness"" of the price and the ""good deal"" for both parties to appeal to Bob's sense of reason.
* **Maintaining a Strong Position:** While lower than my initial offer, $12,000 is still above my minimum acceptable price, so I'm not giving away too much.

**Next Steps:**

I'll carefully consider Bob's response to this counteroffer:

* **Acceptance:** Great!  We have a deal.
* **Rejection:** I'll assess Bob's counteroffer and decide whether to accept or continue negotiating.
* **John's Offer:**  I'll keep John's offer in mind as a backup option if the negotiation with Bob breaks down."
