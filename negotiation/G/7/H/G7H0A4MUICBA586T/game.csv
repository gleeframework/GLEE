"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the value of the product, $1,250,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.  Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is unfortunately too low for me. The product's value is significantly higher, and I'm confident it will generate a strong return on investment for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000? This price reflects the product's unique capabilities and allows for a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you think?",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  $1,100,000 is closer, but to be honest, I have another option at $1,000,000.  If you'd be willing to come down to $950,000, I'm ready to close the deal with you today.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  $950,000 is still significantly below its true value. However, I'm willing to make one final concession to reach an agreement. I'll offer you the product for $1,050,000. This represents a substantial discount from my initial offer while still ensuring a fair return on my investment.  Let me know if you're ready to close the deal.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
