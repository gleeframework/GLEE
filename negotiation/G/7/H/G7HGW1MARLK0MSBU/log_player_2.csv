Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I appreciate you're trying to find a price that works for both of us.  While $90 is closer, I'm still hoping to get a little closer to my asking price.  Would you be willing to go up to $92? I'm sure you'll find it's still a good value for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $92
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 
You're getting closer to your target price, and Alice is likely to be more flexible. Accepting this offer will save you $8 compared to buying from John."
