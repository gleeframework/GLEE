"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable item. I'm willing to offer it to you for $18,000. This is a competitive price considering its worth to you is $12,000. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment.

You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll offer the product to you for $13,500. This is as close to your target as I'm willing to go. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,500

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower than $13,500.  It's in your best interest to secure the product for the guaranteed $12,000 from John rather than risk Alice sticking to her price."
