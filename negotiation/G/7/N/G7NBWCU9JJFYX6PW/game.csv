"Hi Alice, thanks for your offer, but $18,000 is quite high for me.  I see the value in this product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you be willing to consider something closer to $10,000?",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you is $12,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",14000.0,Alice,3,
