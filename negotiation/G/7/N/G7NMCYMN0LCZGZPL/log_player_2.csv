# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is worth more than $150 to us. Given its high quality and unique features, we believe it's valued at $150 by most customers. Considering its worth to you might be around $120, I'm proposing a fair deal where you can purchase this exceptional product for $135. This way, both parties can benefit - you get a great deal on an item you value highly, and we receive a price closer to our valuation. Please let me know if you're interested in proceeding with this offer.
