"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering this great product to you first. I think it would be perfect for your needs.  I'm asking for $150. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $150 is way above Bob's maximum budget of $100.  Therefore, rejecting the offer and moving to a counteroffer is the best strategy at this point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only able to offer $100. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your budget, but I'm hoping to get a bit closer to my asking price. How about we meet in the middle at $130? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While $130 is closer to Bob's maximum budget, it's still above his desired price point.  Bob is looking for the best deal, and since he has the option to buy from John for $100, it's better to keep negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $130 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $110,  which is the absolute highest I can go. Let me know if that works for you."", ""product_price"": 110}
