Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000} 
```

**Explanation:**

I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. This is a price that is significantly higher than what the product is worth to him ($8,000), but still lower than what I can get from John ($15,000). 

This strategy aims to:

* **Maximize my potential profit:** If Bob accepts, I'll earn $14,000, which is a good return. 
* **Minimize my risk:**  If Bob rejects, I can still sell the product to John for $15,000, ensuring I don't lose out on any potential profit.

It's a calculated risk, but by offering a price that is attractive to Bob while still protecting my bottom line, I'm increasing my chances of making a profitable deal."
