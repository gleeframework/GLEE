Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $2,250,000.  I believe this reflects its true worth and potential. What are your thoughts?"",
""product_price"": 2250000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $1,500,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start negotiations significantly higher. This leaves room for negotiation while ensuring we don't settle for less than our minimum.
* **Justification:**  Phrases like ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""true worth and potential"" aim to increase the perceived value of the product in Bob's mind.
* **Open for negotiation:** We end with an open question to encourage a counter-offer from Bob and initiate the negotiation process. 

By setting a high initial price and engaging Bob in a dialogue, we maximize our chances of securing a deal significantly above our minimum selling point."
