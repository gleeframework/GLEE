{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,400,000. It's a steal considering its true value to you. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer starts high, but still leaves room for negotiation.  I'm aiming to maximize my profits while still being attractive to Bob.  It also sets a clear expectation that I'm open to negotiation but not desperate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my initial offer, but still higher than John's offer.  It's worth exploring a counteroffer to try to bridge the gap and get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial gain, and it's fair for me considering the value of the product.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 1300000}
