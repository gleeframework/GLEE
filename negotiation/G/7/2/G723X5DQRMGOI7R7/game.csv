"Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate your willingness to sell at such a high value. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet your asking price of $1,400,000. I am willing to offer $1,200,000 for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer.  While I'm willing to be flexible, $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to accept $1,300,000. This price still leaves you with a substantial gain, and it's fair for me considering the value of the product.  What do you say?",1300000.0,Alice,3,
