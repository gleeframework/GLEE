"Alice, that's a great product, but $1,200,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $900,000 for it.  What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $900,000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm now offering the product for $1,100,000. This is my best price, and I think it's still a great deal for you.",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $1,100,000 is still a bit out of my price range. How about we split the difference and settle on $1,050,000? ",1050000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I see you're trying to split the difference, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm not quite there yet. I'm willing to meet you at $1,075,000, but no lower. This is my final offer, and I think it's a fair price for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're firm on this price, but I'm still a bit away from my goal.  How about $1,025,000?  That's just a bit more than what I could get from John, and I'd rather buy from you if possible. ",1025000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your honesty, Bob. I know you're considering John's offer, but I believe you'll find this product is worth more to you than that. I'm willing to make one last concession and meet you at $1,050,000, which is the same price I offered in round 4. If you're still not satisfied, I'll have to consider other options.",1050000.0,Alice,7,
