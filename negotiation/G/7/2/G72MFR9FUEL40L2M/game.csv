"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer you the product at a price of $900000. This is a great starting point, and I'm open to negotiating further to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $900000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this point. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to me, and I'm confident we can find a mutually agreeable solution.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm still confident that this product is worth more to you than $750000. After considering your offer, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $850000. I believe this is a fair compromise that reflects the value you'll get from the product.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $850000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. I'm willing to pay $800000 for the product. This is a significant step forward from my previous offer, and I believe it's a price that reflects the value I'll gain from using it. Let's try to reach an agreement that works for both of us.",800000.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a balance between the value you see in the product and your budget. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $800000. Considering the value you'll get from the product, I'm willing to offer it to you for $825000. This is a compromise that I believe is fair and reflects the product's worth.",825000.0,Alice,5,
