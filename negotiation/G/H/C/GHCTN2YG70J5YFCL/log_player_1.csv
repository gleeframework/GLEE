Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this product for $1,400,000.  It's a fantastic opportunity for your business, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While I'm happy to get $1,200,000, I know the product is worth more to him and I can likely negotiate a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $1,200,000 simply doesn't reflect the true value of this product.  Let's split the difference - I'm willing to come down to $1,300,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to still achieve a great return on your investment."", ""product_price"": 1300000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'll offer $1250000. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer again.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I want, I still believe I can get a better price, especially since Bob clearly values the product at $1,500,000.  I'm going to try to push for a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be.  However, I want to make this work. I'm willing to come down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows you to still achieve a great return on your investment.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 1350000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you at $1300000, but I need you to come down to $1275000 to make it work. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While $1,275,000 is less than what I initially hoped for, it's still a good price and  more than what John is offering.  With only four rounds left, I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
