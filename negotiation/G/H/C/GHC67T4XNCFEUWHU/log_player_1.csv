"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm really interested in the product, but $15,000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $10,000. Can you meet me in the middle at $12,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
