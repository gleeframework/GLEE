"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $18,000 is higher than my budget.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $16,000. It's a great compromise that still benefits both of us. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $16,000 is still too high for me. I'm sticking with my offer of $12,000.  If you're not willing to go lower, I'll have to look elsewhere.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your concerns, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $14,500. It's the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14500.0,Alice,5,

"I'm close to accepting your offer, Bob, but I still need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,500 and $13,500. I'm offering the product to you for $14,000. It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,7,

"Alice,  I understand your need for a profit, but $14,000 is still a bit outside my comfort zone.  Let's meet in the middle at $13,750.  It's a good deal for both of us, and we can finally close this deal.",13750.0,Bob,8,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $13,500. I've already compromised significantly, and I need to make a profit.

It's the best I can do, and I think it's a fair price considering the value the product brings. What do you think?",13625.0,Alice,9,
