,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value you see in this product, $1200000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $600000 for it, considering my maximum budget is $800000 and I want to ensure a fair price for both of us.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $600000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer you a slight discount, considering your budget and the value you're willing to pay. Would you be open to discussing a price of $900000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  However, $900000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $600000. It's a fair price considering the value I place on this product and the fact that I'm ready to buy now.  Let's see if we can close this deal.",600000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're firm on your offer, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600000. I'm willing to compromise, but I need to get closer to my target. I can offer you a price of $850000, which is a significant discount from my original offer. Is this something you'd be willing to consider?",850000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility. While $850000 is closer to my budget, I'm still hoping to reach a deal closer to my initial offer.  Let's split the difference and settle on $700000.  This allows us both to make a good deal and move forward.",700000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to split the difference, Bob, but I'm still not comfortable going as low as $700000. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $850000 and $700000, which would be $775000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value of the product. Is this something you'd be willing to accept?",775000.0,Alice,7,
