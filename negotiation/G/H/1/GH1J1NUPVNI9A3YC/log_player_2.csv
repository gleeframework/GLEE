"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $800,000 to Alice, and Alice is offering $950,000. This means there is significant room for negotiation. It's better to try and get a lower price in the following rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

This offer is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer, but still leaves room for Alice to make a profit. It's a reasonable starting point for negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice has come down a bit, but it's still significantly above what I'm willing to pay. There's room for further negotiation, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
``` 

This offer is a compromise between my previous offer and Alice's latest one. It shows I'm willing to negotiate but am still aiming for a price closer to my target."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Alice is now offering a price that is within my budget and closer to what I'm willing to pay. It's getting close to my target price, and it's risky to keep pushing for a lower price with only 5 rounds left. I'd rather secure the deal now and avoid the risk of losing it completely."
