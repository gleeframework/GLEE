"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,200,000 is significantly higher than my budget. Given my understanding of the product's value, I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product. I'm open to discussing further, but I can't go higher than this.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your response. I understand your perspective on the price. While $1,200,000 represents what I believe the product is truly worth, I'm willing to negotiate.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,025,000? This price reflects its value while acknowledging your initial offer.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,025,000 is still above my budget.  Let's split the difference. I'm prepared to offer $937,500. This is a fair compromise that recognizes the value of the product while staying within my financial constraints. I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price.",937500.0,Bob,4,
