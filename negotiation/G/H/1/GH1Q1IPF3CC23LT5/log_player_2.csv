You can likely get a better price than $120. It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice first."

Alice's offer:

$110 is still a little more than I'd like to pay. I'll try to get Alice down a bit further before going to John."

While I'd prefer to pay $105, $108 is still a good deal compared to John's price of $150 and gets me the product I want."
