"Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer of $700,000. I appreciate your interest in the product, and I'm willing to consider a revised price. After careful thought, I'm proposing a counter-counteroffer of $850,000. I believe this price still reflects the product's value to you, and I'm open to further negotiation if needed.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the counter offer. I'm still quite interested but $850,000 is a little too high for me. How about we meet in the middle at $775,000?",775000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your latest offer. I understand that you're trying to find a mutually beneficial price, and I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle. However, I'm still not quite ready to accept $775,000. After reconsidering, I'm proposing a revised counteroffer of $825,000. I believe this price is still a good compromise, and I'm open to further discussion if needed.",825000.0,Alice,5,
