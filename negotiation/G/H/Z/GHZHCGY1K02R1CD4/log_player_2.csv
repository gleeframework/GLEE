"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which has been highly valued by its previous owners. Given its quality and features, it's worth significantly more than $100 to me. Considering its true value and the benefits it offers, I am willing to extend this opportunity to you at an exclusive price of $120. This offer allows you to acquire a valuable asset at a reasonable premium compared to its worth to you. I believe this is a fair deal that would benefit both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120.
