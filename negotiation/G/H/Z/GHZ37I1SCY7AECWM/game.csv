"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a budget constraint and need to make a smart financial decision.",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $12,000 is a significant drop from my initial offer.  How about we meet in the middle at $13,000?  This product is truly worth it, and I want to see you benefit from it.",13000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $13,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $12,500. I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",12500.0,Bob,4,
