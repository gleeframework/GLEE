"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested but that price is a little high for me. Could you consider $850,000?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. What do you think?",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you moving on the price. I'm getting closer, but $1,050,000 is still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle at $950,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",1025000.0,Alice,5,
