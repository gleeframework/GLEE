Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that $1,200,000 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $850,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,050,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you and its worth to me. What do you think?

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to find a sweet spot, but I'm still not comfortable going below $1,050,000. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'll meet you at $1,025,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I believe it's still a great deal for you. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,025,000.

At this point, Alice is unlikely to go much lower, and the savings of $25,000 may not be worth the risk of further negotiation.  It's time to take John's offer."
