{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $850,000. I believe this is a fair price considering its value to you. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob ($800,000). This leaves room for negotiation and also ensures I get a profit.  I'm also being upfront about the value of the product to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer but $850000 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay at the moment.  I'm happy to purchase your product for $750000.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $750,000 is a decent offer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $800,000. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to negotiate a higher price."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for coming down a bit, but $825000 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to offer you $800000 for the product, which is right at my budget. Let's see if we can close this deal.
