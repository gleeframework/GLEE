""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this valuable product. Given its potential, I believe a starting price of $1,400,000 is fair. What are your thoughts?"",

"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of the product, but I am only willing to pay up to $1,300,000 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

Bob's offer is still significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I believe there is room for negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I understand your position,  $1,300,000 is a bit too low for me to consider.  Would you be willing to meet me halfway at $1,350,000?"",

While Bob is moving closer to my acceptable range, I believe I can still negotiate a slightly better price. We're not too far apart now."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,335,000
