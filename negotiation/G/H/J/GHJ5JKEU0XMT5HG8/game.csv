,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counter-offer. I understand your perspective on the price.  While $600,000 is too low, I'm willing to move significantly from my initial offer. Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. While $725,000 is still below what I'd hoped for, I'm willing to accept $850,000 as my final offer.  This represents a significant compromise on my part to reach a deal.  Let me know what you think.",850000.0,Alice,5,
