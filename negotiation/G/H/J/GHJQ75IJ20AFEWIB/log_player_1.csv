"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential, but I'm open to discussing it further."", 
""product_price"": 2200000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** We start significantly higher than both Bob's perceived value and our minimum acceptable price. This provides room for negotiation and allows us to gauge Bob's interest level. 
* **Justification:** By highlighting the ""true worth and potential,"" we create a narrative that justifies the high initial price.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** We signal to Bob that we are willing to negotiate, which encourages him to engage in the discussion. 
* **Strategic Positioning:**  While we have John as a backup, our goal is to maximize profit. This first offer is a strategic move to see if we can secure a deal significantly above John's offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $600,000 is significantly below both our minimum acceptable price ($1,500,000) and his own perceived value of the product ($800,000). This suggests there's still room for negotiation. We'll reject this offer to signal that we're serious about a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings."",
""product_price"": 1900000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge and Validate:** We acknowledge Bob's counteroffer and recognize his perspective, showing we're listening and open to negotiation.
* **Reinforce Value:** We reiterate the product's value proposition to justify a higher price, subtly reminding Bob of what's at stake.
* **Significant but Gradual Concession:**  We make a substantial drop from our initial price ($300,000) to demonstrate willingness to negotiate. However, we maintain a price significantly above both Bob's offer and our minimum. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** We're still aiming high, leaving room for further negotiation while moving closer to a potentially acceptable range."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer has increased, it's still significantly below our minimum acceptable price and our target selling price.  We need to signal that we're serious about a much higher valuation. We'll reject this offer and propose a counteroffer that brings us closer to a potential compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down significantly to $1,600,000.  This is my absolute best price and reflects the immense value this product brings."",
""product_price"": 1600000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Building Rapport:** We continue to emphasize collaboration and finding a mutually beneficial agreement.
* **Transparency and Anchoring:**  We introduce the concept of a ""hard minimum"" without explicitly stating the amount. This anchors Bob's perception around a higher price point while implying a limit to our flexibility.
* **Significant Concession:** We make a substantial drop of $300,000, signaling our commitment to the negotiation and putting pressure on Bob to reciprocate.
* **Finality:** By stating ""absolute best price,"" we signal that this is a final offer, prompting a decisive response from Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  However,  $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's the absolute limit of what I can justify.  It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll reconsider. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""SellToJhon""
}
```

**Reasoning:**

It's time to walk away from the negotiation with Bob and accept John's offer. Here's why:

* **Unrealistic Expectations:** Bob's offer of $750,000, even with his ""absolute limit"" statement, is still significantly below our $1,500,000 minimum.  The gap is too large to bridge in the remaining rounds.
* **Slow Progress:** Bob's incremental increases suggest a reluctance to meet our valuation.  Continuing would likely involve significant concessions from us for minimal gains.
* **Opportunity Cost:**  Every round spent on Bob is a round lost in potentially finding a better deal elsewhere.  We have a guaranteed offer from John that meets our minimum price.
* **Strong Alternative:** John's offer of $1,500,000 provides a secure and immediate return. It eliminates the risk of further negotiation and potential failure to reach an agreement with Bob.

While we aimed for a higher price, accepting John's offer ensures we get a fair value for the product without jeopardizing the deal."
