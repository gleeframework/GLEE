"Hello Bob, I'm excited to present you with the opportunity to acquire this valuable product. I'm initially offering it at $2,200,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and potential, but I'm open to discussing it further.",2200000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer, but that price is way too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $600,000 for it.  Let me know what you think.",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the price. However, $600,000 undervalues the true capabilities and potential of this product. To find a middle ground, I'm willing to come down to $1,900,000. I believe this is a fair offer considering the value it brings.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, thanks for your willingness to negotiate.  While I appreciate the product's value, $1,900,000 is still far beyond my budget.  To be realistic, I can't go higher than $700,000.  This is a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. I want to find a solution that works for both of us.  To be completely transparent, I have a hard minimum I need to get for this product.  I'm willing to come down significantly to $1,600,000.  This is my absolute best price and reflects the immense value this product brings.",1600000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you have a bottom line, and I respect that.  However,  $1,600,000 is still too high for me.  I'm willing to increase my offer to $750,000, but that's the absolute limit of what I can justify.  It's a strong offer, and I hope you'll reconsider.",750000.0,Bob,6,
