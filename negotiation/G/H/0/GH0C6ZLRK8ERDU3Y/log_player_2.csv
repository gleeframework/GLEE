"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. Alice's offer is $1,000 above Bob's maximum price. It's worth negotiating with Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7500}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to be aggressive in the first counteroffer.  He's offering $500 less than his maximum price, hoping to get Alice to budge. He's also signaling that he's serious about getting a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept since it's closer to his target, Bob still has some room for negotiation and doesn't want to settle for a worse deal if he can avoid it. There are still 7 rounds remaining, so there is potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 7800}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is increasing his offer slightly from the previous round.  He's showing Alice that he's willing to compromise, but still wants to get a better price than her last offer.  He's also trying to find a middle ground that both parties might be happy with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still higher than Bob's maximum price of $8,000. While it's tempting to accept given the progress in the negotiation, Bob still has some room for negotiation and doesn't want to settle for a worse deal if he can avoid it.  There are still 5 rounds remaining, so there is potential to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is making a final push. He's offering his maximum price, signaling that he's serious about buying the product but won't go any higher. With only 4 rounds remaining, it's a high-risk, high-reward move. If Alice accepts, Bob gets the product at his target price. If she rejects, he can still buy from John, but it's a gamble that could cost him valuable time."
