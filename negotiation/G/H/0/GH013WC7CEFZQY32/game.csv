"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Would you consider a lower price, say around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand you're on a tight budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $850,000. This is a fair compromise considering its value to you and the market price.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  However, $850,000 is still a bit high for my budget.  How about we settle somewhere around $775,000? That feels like a fair compromise to me.",775000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're still interested in the product, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $775,000. I can offer it to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you and the market price. Let's meet in the middle, but not quite at the lowest point.",825000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're firm on the price, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $800,000?  That's a significant investment for me, and I believe it's a fair offer considering your valuation.",800000.0,Bob,6,
