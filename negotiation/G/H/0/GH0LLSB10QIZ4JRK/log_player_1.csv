Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $12,000. 
* **My Minimum:** I need at least $10,000 for the product. 
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed backup offer of $10,000 from John.

By offering $11,500, I'm:

* **Maximizing Profit:**  I'm aiming for a higher profit than John's offer.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  I'm leaving some room for Bob to negotiate, as he has a higher perceived value for the product.

This strategy balances maximizing profit while also acknowledging the risk of Bob rejecting the offer."
