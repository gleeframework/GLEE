"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in this product, but that price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to start the negotiation at $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your counter-offer, but $900,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. To find a middle ground, I'm proposing $1,075,000. This reflects my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1075000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this.  While I understand the value you place on the product, $1,075,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. Would you be willing to consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
