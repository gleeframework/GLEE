"Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. It's a one-of-a-kind item that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to sell it to you for $150. It's a great deal, and I think you won't find a better price anywhere else.",150.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you offering me this unique product. However, $150 is a bit more than I'm comfortable spending at this time. I'm willing to pay $100 for it. Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob! I understand that $150 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $130. It's still a great deal, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. $130 is still a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to go up to $115. This would be a fair price for both of us and would allow me to purchase the product without breaking the bank. Let me know what you think.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob! I'm glad we're getting closer to a deal. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $115. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, and I'm offering the product to you for $125. It's a fair price, and I think you'll be happy with the product.",125.0,Alice,5,
