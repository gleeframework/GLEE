Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone like you, and I'm confident you'll find it to be worth the investment. I'm asking for $1,500,000.  Let me know your decision."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,200,000, you have a strong position. Starting with a higher offer of $1,500,000 allows room for negotiation while ensuring you don't sell below your minimum.
* **Value Emphasis:** The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to justify the high price.
* **Clear Call to Action:** The message ends with a clear call to action, prompting Bob to make a decision. 

**It's important to note:** This is just one strategy. You could start with a lower price to appear more flexible or employ other negotiation tactics depending on your understanding of Bob's personality and business style."
