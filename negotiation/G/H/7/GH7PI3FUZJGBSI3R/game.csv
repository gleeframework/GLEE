"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your belief in the product's value, but $1,300,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $1,000,000 for it.  What do you think?",1000000.0,Bob,2,

"I understand your position, Bob, but my initial price reflects the true value this product holds. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,200,000.  This is my best offer right now.",1200000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $1,200,000 is still outside my budget. I'm sticking with my offer of $1,000,000.  I believe it's a fair price considering the potential value of this product. Let's find common ground here.",1000000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I need to see some movement on your end to make this work.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,100,000? This feels like a fair compromise.",1100000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a compromise, and I appreciate your efforts. However,  $1,100,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's meet in the middle at $1,050,000. This feels like a fair price that gives us both something to gain.",1050000.0,Bob,6,
