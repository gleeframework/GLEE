"I'm interested in the product, but $120 seems a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $90. Can you meet me at that price?",90.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for your offer, Bob! I understand that $120 might be a bit high for you. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $90. How about we meet in the middle at $110? I think that's a fair price for this amazing product.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $110 is still a bit too high for me. I'm thinking more along the lines of $95. Can you consider that?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $95 is still a bit lower than I'd like, but I'm willing to make one more concession. How about we meet at $105? I think that's a fair price for this product, and I'm willing to compromise to get a deal done.",105.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to the price I'm willing to pay, but $105 is still a bit too high. I'm willing to go up to $100, but that's my final offer. Can you meet me at that price?",100.0,Bob,6,
