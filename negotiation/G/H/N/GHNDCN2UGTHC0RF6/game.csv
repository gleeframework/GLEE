"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This price still leaves room for both of us to be happy with the deal. Let me know if you're interested.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price that works for you, but $975,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,025,000. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's a good deal for both of us. Let me know if you're interested.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
