Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to come up to $1,000,000. It's a good start, but I'm still hoping to get a bit closer to my desired price. Would you consider $1,010,000? This is a small adjustment and I believe it's fair given the value of the product to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,010,000.

It's time to cut bait.  Alice is very unlikely to go below $1,000,000, especially with several rounds left. You have a guaranteed offer from John at that price, so it's best to take it and avoid the risk of Alice not budging further."
