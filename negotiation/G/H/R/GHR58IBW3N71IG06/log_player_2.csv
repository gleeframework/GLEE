"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to discuss the details with you. As we start the negotiation, I'd like to make an initial offer of $1,200,001 for the product. This is a great starting point, and I'm confident we can work together to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,001. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,001
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:** 

While Alice's offer is close to your maximum, it's still slightly above your target. Since you have more rounds, it's worth trying to negotiate a lower price. You can always fall back to John's offer if the negotiation fails."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but I'm hoping to get the product for a bit less. I'm happy to pay $1,100,000 for it.  I'm confident this is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal quickly."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, showcasing your willingness to negotiate.  It's important to set a lower price to see if she's willing to come down. If she's not, you can then gradually increase your offer in subsequent rounds, getting closer to your target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not quite comfortable with the price of $1,100,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $1,300,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still higher than your maximum price. While it's a slight improvement from her initial offer, it's not enough to make it a worthwhile purchase.  You're better off trying to negotiate further and see if you can get a lower price, especially since you still have rounds left."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,300,000 is still a bit too high for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground. I'm willing to pay $1,150,000 for the product. This offer is closer to what I can afford, and I believe it's a reasonable compromise.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement in this round."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant step closer to Alice's last offer, demonstrating your willingness to compromise while still keeping your goal of a lower price in mind. This shows that you are taking her counteroffer seriously while still advocating for a price you're comfortable with."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price of $1,150,000. I'm willing to make another concession and offer the product to you for $1,250,000. This is as low as I can go, and I believe it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,250,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,250,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. While it's a significant reduction from her initial offer, you're still within your negotiation window and can potentially get a better price.  It's worth trying one more counteroffer before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further. I'm still not quite there with $1,250,000.  How about we settle on $1,200,000? This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to finalize this deal. I'm confident we can agree on this price."", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is your final attempt to reach a price you are comfortable with.  You are proposing the price John is offering, so it's a win-win scenario if Alice accepts. If she rejects, you can proceed to buy from John, which is still a successful outcome."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a compromise, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to make a small concession to move closer to your desired price. I'll offer the product to you for $1,225,000. This is the lowest price I can accept, and I hope we can finally reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,225,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,225,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is still above your maximum price. You have only a few rounds left and you don't want to risk getting stuck with a price higher than your budget.  Even though you have one more round, it's best to take John's offer, which is your maximum price and ensures a successful outcome."
