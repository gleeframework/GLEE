"Hi Bob, I understand you're still looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $11,000. However, I'm willing to throw in some extras to sweeten the deal. I'll include a premium warranty and dedicated support for the product. I think this is a great value for $11,000. What do you think?",11000.0,Alice,5,
