"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic opportunity to purchase a unique product. Given its immense value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,150,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for us to negotiate a mutually beneficial deal.",1150000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $900,000 is significantly below my bottom line.  This product holds substantial value, and I'm confident it will yield significant returns for you. How about we meet in the middle at $1,050,000? This demonstrates my willingness to negotiate while ensuring a fair deal for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my previous offer, so how about we try $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your position, but I need to be realistic about the value of this product. I'm willing to come down slightly to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to benefit from this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1,025,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $975,000, which I think is a fair price considering the product's value to me.",975000.0,Bob,6,
