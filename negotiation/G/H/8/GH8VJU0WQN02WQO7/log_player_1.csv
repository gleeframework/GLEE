"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($80) but still leaves room for negotiation. I believe Bob will be motivated to negotiate as he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my initial offer and what I believe the product is worth. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to find a price closer to my desired $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm countering with $105. This is a compromise from my initial offer but still allows for a good profit. I hope this offer will be enticing enough for Bob to accept, considering his previous offer and the fact that he values the product at $150."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $92.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92.5
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my desired price, I believe we can still reach a better agreement. I'm willing to negotiate further, hoping to get closer to my target price of $105."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $100. This is a slight concession but still ensures a good profit for me. I'm hoping that this time, Bob will accept, as the offer is closer to his previous offer, and the deal will be made."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $96. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $96
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $96 is closer to my target price of $100 and represents a significant profit compared to selling to John.  Given that we've reached round 6, there's a risk that further negotiation might lead to a lower offer or even a stalemate.  It's better to secure the deal now and avoid potential losses."
