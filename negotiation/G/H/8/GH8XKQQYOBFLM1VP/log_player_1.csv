Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I believe this product would be incredibly beneficial for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $950,000. This is a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable."", 
""product_price"": 950000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **Understanding Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $800,000, so any offer below this will likely be accepted but leaves money on the table.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering it at $950,000 creates a strong incentive for Bob. He gains $150,000 in value ($800,000 his value - $950,000 price = -$150,000, meaning he ""saves"" $150,000).
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the initial offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to counter-offer if he's very price-sensitive. This still allows you to potentially secure a deal above your guaranteed $1,000,000."
