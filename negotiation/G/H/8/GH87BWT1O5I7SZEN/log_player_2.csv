"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. Given its value to you, I believe it's worth more than $8,000. Considering its true worth, would you be interested in discussing a price closer to $12,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should try to get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you acknowledging the product's value to me. However, $12,000 is a bit steep for my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 9000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your response, Bob. I understand your budget constraints. Considering the value of the product to both of us, I propose we aim for a price closer to $10,500. Would you find this offer acceptable? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $10,500 is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer and getting closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob should aim for a price closer to his initial counteroffer of $9,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $10,500 is still a bit out of my range. Let's meet in the middle at $9,500.  This would be a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 9500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I see where you're coming from, Bob. Let's try $10,000 as a compromise. It's higher than your last offer but lower than mine. Is this a price that could work for you? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

At this point, Bob has gone through several rounds of negotiation and is getting closer to his desired price.  While $10,000 is slightly above his last counteroffer of $9,500, it's a reasonable compromise and a significant savings compared to John's offer of $15,000. It's likely that further negotiation will only yield small incremental decreases in price, and it's not worth risking losing the deal with Alice altogether."
