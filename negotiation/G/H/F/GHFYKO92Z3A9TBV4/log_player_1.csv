Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $175. It's a great deal! Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 
 
I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what I believe the product is worth to me ($150).  This gives me room to negotiate if Bob counters.  However, I'm not going to start too high, as I don't want to scare him away immediately."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, $175 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I'm only willing to pay $125.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is too low.  It's below my minimum price of $150. I will counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest but $125 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $140. This is still a fair price for the product and gives us both a good deal."", ""product_price"": 140}
```

I'm trying to find a middle ground. My counteroffer is still higher than my minimum price, but it's a significant reduction from my initial offer. This should make Bob feel like we are making progress, encouraging him to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  $140 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. How about $130?  I'm sure we can find a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $130
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is still below my minimum price of $150, even after my counteroffer.  At this point, it's better to sell to John for $150 and avoid further negotiations.  I can always try to negotiate with Bob again later, but there's no guarantee he will change his mind."
