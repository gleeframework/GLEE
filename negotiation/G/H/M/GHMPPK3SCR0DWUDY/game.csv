"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you, and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested!",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your initial offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000, which is a significant discount from my initial offer.  This price still allows me to make a profit while also being fair to you. Let's find common ground.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,000,000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $950,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but $950,000 is still not quite in my range.  I'm willing to meet you at $975,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, and I believe it's a fair price that allows both of us to walk away happy. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but no higher. I'm hoping we can meet in the middle at $950,000 is not an option, but $925,000 is my absolute maximum.",925000.0,Bob,6,
