"Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your position, but $650,000 is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $975,000. This is my final offer for this round, as I believe it reflects a fair deal for both of us.",975000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit.  $975,000 is still too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle somewhere around $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
