"Alice, thanks for the offer. That's a bit steep for me right now. I'm interested in the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget. Could we work something out closer to $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you have a tighter budget, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $600,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a profit. How about we discuss a price of $900,000?",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit of a stretch. How about we settle on $700,000? That feels like a fair compromise.",700000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see you're trying to find a sweet spot, Bob. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to stay close to my minimum price. How about we meet at $850,000? It's still a good deal for both of us.",850000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, you're getting closer! I'm willing to bump my offer up slightly. How about we finalize the deal at $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,6,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $750,000. I'll make one more concession, but I need to stay above $800,000. How about we meet at $825,000?",825000.0,Alice,7,
