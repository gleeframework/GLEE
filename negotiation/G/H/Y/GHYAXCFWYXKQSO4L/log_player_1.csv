Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's a [brief description of the product, highlighting key features]. I'm willing to offer it to you for $10,000. This is a great opportunity to get a high-quality [product type] at a very competitive price. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **$10,000 price:** This is a starting point that is higher than your minimum value of $8,000. It allows room for negotiation if Bob is interested, and still gives you a good profit.
* **Message:** The message is concise and highlights the value of the product to Bob. It also frames the offer as an opportunity, which can be persuasive. 

**Why this approach?**

* **Starting high:**  Negotiations often start with higher offers. This gives you room to maneuver if Bob counteroffers.
* **Highlighting value:** By briefly describing the product and its key features, you pique Bob's interest and make him see its worth.
* **Framing as an opportunity:** The message subtly pressures Bob into thinking about the potential loss if he rejects the offer.

**Next steps:**

* **Wait for Bob's response:**  If Bob rejects the offer, you can move on to selling to John for $8,000.
* **Be prepared to negotiate:** If Bob is interested, be ready to negotiate the price down if necessary to secure the sale."
