"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,400,000. This is a great deal for both of us, as you can see the value it holds for you.  Let me know if you're interested!  If not, I have another buyer lined up, so I won't be able to hold this offer for long. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","I will reject Alice's offer. The product is worth no more than $800,000 to me, and Alice is offering it to me for $1,400,000. That's too expensive. I'll look for a better deal.
