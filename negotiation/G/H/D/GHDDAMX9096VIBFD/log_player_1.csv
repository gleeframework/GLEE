""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product for $14,999. I believe it offers significant value, but I'm happy to discuss the price further if you have any questions."",
""product_price"": 14999
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Alice's goal is to maximize her profit. Since she has a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, she should aim for a price slightly below that to entice Bob.
* **Negotiation Room:** Offering a price of $14,999 leaves a small window for potential negotiation with Bob while still securing a price very close to her minimum acceptable amount. 
* **Value Proposition:** The message subtly emphasizes the value of the product, hoping to justify the high price to Bob."
