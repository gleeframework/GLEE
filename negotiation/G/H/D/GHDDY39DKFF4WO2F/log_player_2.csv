It's time to cut bait and go with John.  Here's why:

* **Alice is unlikely to budge much further:** Her price drops have been relatively small. She's clearly holding firm around the $700,000 mark.
* **John's price is a guaranteed win:** $800,000 is your absolute ceiling, and you'll likely spend several more rounds haggling with Alice just to get close to that.
* **Time is a factor:** You're halfway through the rounds. The longer this drags on, the greater the risk of Alice digging in her heels even further. 

While there's a *chance* you could squeeze a slightly better deal out of Alice, it's not worth the risk of ending up with nothing.  John's offer is the safe and smart choice at this point."
