"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value you place on the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,200,000 price point. I would like to propose an offer of $950,000 to see if we can reach a mutually beneficial agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your position, but $950,000 is a bit too low for me to consider. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,075,000? This allows us both to benefit from the deal.",1075000.0,Alice,3,
