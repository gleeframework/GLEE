Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product I think you'd be interested in. It's worth at least $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $115. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 115}
``` 

This offer starts the negotiation at a price higher than your minimum but leaves room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a raw deal. It also explicitly states the value to Bob, making the offer more attractive."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $110. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, there's still room for negotiation. I'll reject his offer and try to get a slightly higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest. $110 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $112. That's a fair compromise, considering the value of the product to you."", ""product_price"": 112}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $112. Can you meet me at $110 again? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to stay within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While I'd prefer to get closer to $112, Bob's offer is very close to my minimum and it's clear he's not going to budge much further. Accepting his offer is the best option to secure a sale and maximize my earnings at this point."
