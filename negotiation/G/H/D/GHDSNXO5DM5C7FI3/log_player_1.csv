Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,050,000 for your product. This price is closer to what I am willing to pay, and I hope we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,050,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,050,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob, and he offered $1,050,000. I'm still aiming for a higher price and want to see if I can get closer to my desired amount.  Rejecting his offer allows me to make a counteroffer in the next round."

I'm still aiming for a higher price.  Bob is getting closer to my desired price point, but I'm not yet ready to settle for that amount. I will counter again in the next round."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I see that we're getting closer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $1,080,000 for your product. I believe this is a fair compromise, considering the value you're offering. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,080,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,080,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob has offered $1,080,000, which is very close to my last counteroffer of $1,087,500.  Considering that I only have 4 rounds left, it's a good idea to accept this offer to avoid risking getting a lower price or having to sell to John for $1,000,000."
