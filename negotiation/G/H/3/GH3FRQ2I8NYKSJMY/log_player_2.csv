# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal, considering its value to you. Let me know what you think!

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. How about we settle at $11,000?"",

This counteroffer aims to significantly lower the price, starting the negotiation closer to my desired range. It also acknowledges Alice's offer while expressing my price limit."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $11,000 is unfortunately too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need at least $13,000 to make this worthwhile.  Let's find a middle ground that works for both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Alice is willing to negotiate, $13,000 is still above my target price. I'll try to meet her halfway with my next counteroffer."

``` 

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground between Alice's latest offer and my previous counteroffer. It emphasizes fairness and presents $12,000 as a mutually beneficial solution."
