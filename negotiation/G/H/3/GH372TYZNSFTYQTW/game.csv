"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $17,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying right now. I'd be willing to pay $14,500 for it.  What do you think?",14500.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, though. How about $16,000?  It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but $16,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to go up to $15,500 for the product.  Let me know if that works for you.",15500.0,Bob,4,
