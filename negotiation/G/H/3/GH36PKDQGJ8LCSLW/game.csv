"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $9,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider lowering the price to $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $7,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $8,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
