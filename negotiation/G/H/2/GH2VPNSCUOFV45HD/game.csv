"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down a little further, but how about $105?  That's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $105 is still a bit higher than I'd like to pay. How about $95? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really think that's the most I can afford.",95.0,Bob,4,
