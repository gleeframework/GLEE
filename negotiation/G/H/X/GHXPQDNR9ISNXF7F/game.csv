"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  To be totally transparent, I can get the product elsewhere for $1,000,000.  To make this work for me, I'd need you to come down a bit more. Would you consider $925,000?",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you've found a competitor offering the product for $1,000,000, but I'm not willing to go that low. However, I'm willing to make one more concession to meet you in the middle. I'll offer you the product for $975,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, considering the product's value to me is $1,500,000. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.",975000.0,Alice,5,
