"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you this incredible product for $1,000,000. It's a steal considering its true value. I'm confident you'll find it a worthwhile investment."", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting price:**  I'm starting high to leave room for negotiation and to gauge Bob's interest.
* **Emphasis on value:**  Mentioning the product's ""true value""  subtly hints at a higher worth while not revealing my minimum.
* **Positive framing:**  ""Steal"" and ""worthwhile investment"" create a positive perception in Bob's mind. 

This strategy aims to set a strong initial price and start the negotiation from a position of strength."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thank you for your offer. I appreciate the value you're placing on the product. However, I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $850000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $850,000 is a decent offer, I'm aiming for a higher price. I have 9 rounds left, so rejecting this offer and making a counteroffer gives me more room to negotiate.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired price range by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $850,000 is a good starting point, I'm still aiming for a price that reflects the product's true value. I'm willing to come down to $950,000. Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 950000}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Acknowledge Bob's offer:** Show appreciation for his counteroffer, building rapport.
* **Reaffirm value:**  Reiterate the product's value to justify my price.
* **Compromise:**  Lower my price, but not drastically, to signal I'm willing to negotiate but still value the product highly.
* **Call to action:**  Invite Bob to find ""common ground"" to encourage further negotiation.

This counteroffer keeps the negotiation moving while pushing for a more favorable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position and respect the value you place on the product. Based on my research and considerations, I would like to propose a price of $900000. This is my best offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob has come up to $900,000, which is within a reasonable range of my desired price.  While I'd ideally like more, accepting his offer in this round avoids the risk of further negotiation going south and secures a price well above my minimum of $800,000. 

It's important to consider that we're only on round 4, and I have a good chance of pushing for a higher price later.  However,  the risk of Bob walking away or further rounds failing to yield a better price makes accepting his current offer the most strategic choice."
