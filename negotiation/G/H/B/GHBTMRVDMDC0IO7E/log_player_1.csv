I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,500. This is a price that is higher than my minimum value of $10,000 but leaves some room for negotiation.  I believe this is a fair starting point, considering Bob values the product at $12,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

While Bob's offer is better than selling to John, I believe I can get closer to my target price. I will reject his offer and try to negotiate a higher price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11200}
``` 

I'm offering the product to Bob for $11,200. This is a compromise from my initial offer, but still above Bob's counteroffer and closer to my target price.  I believe this is a fair offer considering the value of the product to both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer is getting too close to my minimum acceptable price, and I'm worried that if I continue negotiating, we might not be able to reach a mutually agreeable price. Therefore, I will sell the product to John for $10,000 to guarantee a sale and avoid further negotiations."
