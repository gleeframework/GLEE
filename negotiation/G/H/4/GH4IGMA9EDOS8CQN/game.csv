"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?",20000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider a lower price?",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us.",17000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider meeting me at that price?",14000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I can come down to $15,500, my final offer.",15500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $14,000, which would be $14,750. Can you consider that?",14750.0,Bob,6,
