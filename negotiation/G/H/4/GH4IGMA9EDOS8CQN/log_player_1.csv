Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but $20,000 is a bit high for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $12,000. Can you consider a lower price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""I understand your position, Bob, but $12,000 is significantly less than what I'm willing to accept. How about we meet in the middle at $17,000? I believe that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 17000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but $17,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,000, but that's my maximum. Can you consider meeting me at that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
This is a tricky one. I'm tempted to take $14,000, but there's still room for negotiation.  Let's see if we can push a bit further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  Let's make this happen - I can come down to $15,500, my final offer."", ""product_price"": 15500}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm getting close to accepting, Alice, but I still think we can do better. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $15,500 and $14,000, which would be $14,750. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}

It's not worth the risk of Bob going even lower. It's time to take the guaranteed $15,000 from John."
