"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's initial offer is too high. There's room for negotiation, and it's worth seeing if you can get a better price from Alice before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?"",
""product_price"": 65
}
```

This counter-offer does a few things:

* **Polite and Engaged:** It acknowledges Alice's offer and expresses continued interest.
* **Signals Budget:** Offering $65 is a significant jump down from $100, but it leaves room for negotiation while staying under your $80 maximum.
* **Anchoring:**  By starting low, you're setting an anchor point for the negotiation. Alice is now more likely to counter with a price closer to your offer than if you had started higher."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Alice is getting closer to your budget, but you're still above what John offers. There's a small chance Alice might be willing to go even lower, so it's worth one more try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 75
}
```

Here's the strategy behind this counteroffer:

* **Compromise:**  By suggesting $75, you're demonstrating a willingness to compromise and move closer to Alice's price. 
* **""Fair Deal"" Framing:** This positions the offer as mutually beneficial, not just a win for you.
* **Final Push:**  This is likely your last offer before considering John's deal seriously. It keeps you below your $80 limit while still giving Alice a chance to make a sale."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your perspective. While $75 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $90. This would be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

It's time to cut your losses. Alice is unlikely to go below $90, and you've already gotten her to come down significantly. Buying from John for $80 is the best option now to ensure you stay within your budget."
