"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65?",65.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be.",85.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us.",75.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective. While $75 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $90. This would be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point.  Let me know what you think!",90.0,Alice,5,
