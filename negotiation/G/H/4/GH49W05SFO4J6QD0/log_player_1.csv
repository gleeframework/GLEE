Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product and I think you'd really appreciate it.  I'm offering it to you for $100, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  Offering $100 is a good starting point, as it's above Bob's perceived value but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Positive Tone:**  The message is friendly and emphasizes the value of the product, making Bob more likely to consider the offer.
* **Open to Negotiation:** The message clearly indicates that you're open to negotiating, making Bob feel more comfortable counter-offering.

This strategy aims to secure a price closer to your minimum while keeping the negotiation process open and amicable."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $100 is a bit too steep for me. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $65 is significantly below my minimum value of $120 and even below Bob's perceived value of $80. Accepting would result in a substantial loss for me.
* **Opportunity for a better deal:**  Rejecting Bob's offer keeps the negotiation open. I can counteroffer with a price closer to my minimum value. 
* **John's offer is secure:**  While I'm willing to negotiate with Bob, I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, so I'm not desperate to accept a low price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest!  While $65 is a bit low for me, I'm open to finding a price that works for both of us.  How about $85?  It's still a good deal for you, and it gets us closer to where I need to be."", ""product_price"": 85}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the middle:**  $85 is a compromise between Bob's offer of $65 and my minimum value of $120. 
* **Highlighting value:**  The message emphasizes that $85 is still a good deal for Bob,  making the counteroffer more appealing. 
* **Openness to negotiation:**  The message  indicates  I'm  still  willing  to  negotiate,  keeping  the  door  open  for  further  discussion. 

This strategy aims to reach a mutually acceptable price while still protecting my minimum profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me on the price, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $75? That's a fair deal for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Still below minimum:** While $75 is closer to my minimum value of $120, it's still below it. Accepting would mean a significant loss.
* **Potential for a better deal:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to continue negotiating and potentially get a price closer to my desired outcome. 
* **John's offer remains secure:**  I have a guaranteed sale with John at $120, which gives me a safety net and allows me to be more firm in negotiations with Bob.

By rejecting Bob's offer, I can maintain my position and continue pushing for a price that is more favorable."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective. While $75 is closer, I'm still not quite there yet. I'm willing to go down to $90. This would be a great deal for you, and it's the best I can offer at this point.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 90}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Moving closer to Bob's offer:**  $90 is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer of $75 while still staying above my minimum value of $120. 
* **Framing it as a win for Bob:** The message emphasizes that $90 is a great deal for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Setting a firm limit:**  The message indicates that this is my best offer, signaling to Bob that further concessions are unlikely. 

This strategy aims to secure a price that is both acceptable to me and potentially appealing to Bob, without jeopardizing my minimum profit."
