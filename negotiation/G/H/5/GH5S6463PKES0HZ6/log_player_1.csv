"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting with a high price of $1,000,000. This is a bold move, but I believe it's important to establish a high baseline and see where Bob stands. If he's truly interested, he'll likely counter with a lower offer, allowing us to negotiate from there."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $750,000 is a decent offer, I believe I can do better.  I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can push for a price closer to my initial asking price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a significant reduction from my initial offer, but it's still a respectable price. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to meet me halfway and close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $700,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $700,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $700,000 is getting closer to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a better price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my goal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm offering $850,000 as a counteroffer. This is a significant compromise on my part, but I believe it's a fair price considering Bob's repeated attempts to negotiate.  It's also a safer bet than selling to John for $800,000, as I'm still leaving room for some wiggle room in case Bob is willing to pay a bit more."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $650,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $650,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob's offer of $650,000 is getting too low for me. I'm not comfortable going lower than $800,000 for the product.  It's time to cut my losses and sell to John.  While I'd prefer to get a higher price, I don't want to risk getting stuck with a deal that is too low."
