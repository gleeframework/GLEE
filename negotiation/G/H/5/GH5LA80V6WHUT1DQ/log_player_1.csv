Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a fantastic product for you that I'm sure you'll love.  I'm asking $150 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Offering $150 initially allows room for negotiation while still being above my minimum acceptable value ($100).
* **Open to Negotiation:**  This phrase conveys flexibility and makes Bob feel like he has some control, which can lead to a smoother negotiation. 
* **Positive Framing:** Highlighting the product's value and suggesting Bob will love it encourages him to consider the offer.

This is a good starting point, but I'll need to adapt my strategy based on Bob's response and my assessment of his interest level."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I'm really interested in the product, but $150 is a bit more than I'm willing to spend right now.  How about $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is my minimum:** While $100 is my minimum acceptable price, I don't want to settle for it right away. There's potential to get more. 
* **Further Negotiation:** Rejecting Bob's offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a price closer to my initial asking price of $150.
* **Testing Bob's Interest:**  Seeing if Bob is willing to increase his offer will give me a better understanding of his true value for the product."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest! $100 is a bit lower than what I'm looking for, but I'm willing to be flexible. How about $120?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and you'd still be getting a great deal on this awesome product."", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:**  I'm offering a middle ground between my initial price and Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate.
* **Positive Framing:**  I'm emphasizing the value of the product and the benefits of the deal for Bob.
* **Fairness:**  I'm framing $120 as a ""fair price,"" which can make Bob feel more comfortable agreeing to it. 

I'm hoping this counteroffer will be more appealing to Bob, but I'm ready to adjust my strategy based on his response."
