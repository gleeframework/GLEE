"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value and my budget.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your perspective on the value. While $1,200,000 is a bit too low for me to consider, I'm willing to meet you closer to the middle. How about we settle on $1,900,000? I believe this reflects the true worth of the product.",1900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,900,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is the lowest I can go. I'm hoping we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
