"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to get closer to the product's true value. How about we discuss a price of $950,000?

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:

# Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer. I can see you're firm on your price, but I need to be mindful of my budget.  Would you consider $775,000?  That's a significant jump on my end, and I believe it represents a fair deal for both of us."", ""product_price"": 775000}"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $775,000 is still below my minimum price. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my target. Let's meet at $900,000, but I'm willing to throw in some additional value to sweeten the deal. How about we include a 3-year warranty and dedicated support? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is clearly holding firm around the $900,000 mark. While the added warranty and support are nice, they don't significantly impact the product's core value to us.  We're getting close to the point where we need to decide if the potential savings are worth the risk of continued negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the added incentives, and I respect your position on the price.  This is my final offer â€“ $800,000.  It's a strong offer, and it allows us both to walk away feeling like we got a fair deal."", ""product_price"": 800000} 

**Reasoning:** 

We're pushing our luck a bit by going straight to Alice's known value, but there's a chance she's eager enough to close the deal that she'll accept. If she rejects this offer, we'll need to seriously consider taking John's deal in the next round to avoid potentially overpaying."
