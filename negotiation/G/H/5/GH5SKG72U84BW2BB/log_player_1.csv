{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this unique product. I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit your operations.  While my asking price is $1,450,000, I'm open to discussing a figure that makes this a win-win. What do you think?"", 
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Aim high but leave room for negotiation. Starting close to your minimum ($1,500,000) maximizes potential profit.
* **Acknowledging Bob's Perspective:** Mentioning the product's value to Bob builds rapport and suggests you understand his needs.
* **Openness to Negotiation:** ""Open to discussing"" signals flexibility and willingness to find a mutually agreeable price. 
* **Targeting a Win-Win:** This phrasing emphasizes finding a solution beneficial to both parties, encouraging Bob to engage.

**Why this strategy:**

This offer balances maximizing profit with the risk of losing Bob as a buyer. If Bob rejects the initial price, there's room to negotiate down towards his perceived value ($1,200,000) while staying above John's guaranteed offer."
