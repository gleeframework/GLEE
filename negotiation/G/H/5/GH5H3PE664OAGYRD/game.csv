"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I believe that's a fair price considering its value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective. While I'm happy to negotiate,  $1200000 is a bit too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $1350000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a mutually beneficial deal.",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm thinking more along the lines of $1200000, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1250000. Can we discuss this further?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to find a price point that works for both of us. While I appreciate your offer, I'm still not comfortable with $1250000. To bridge the gap, I'm willing to lower my price to $1300000. This leaves some room for negotiation, but also reflects the true value of the product. Let's see if we can come to an agreement at this price.",1300000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still a bit concerned about the price. I'm willing to meet you at $1250000, but I'd like to propose a slight discount for a quick sale. How about $1225000?",1225000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're trying to get a good deal. While I'm open to negotiation,  $1225000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's meet in the middle again.  I'm willing to go down to $1275000.  This reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal. Let's close this quickly.",1275000.0,Alice,7,
