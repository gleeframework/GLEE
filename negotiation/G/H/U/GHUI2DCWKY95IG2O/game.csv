"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know what you think!",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this price?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $600000 doesn't quite reflect the unique value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.  What do you say?",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $725000?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep working towards a deal.  How about we compromise at $775000? It's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's close this deal and move forward.",775000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $775000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price.",750000.0,Bob,6,
