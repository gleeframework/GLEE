"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a unique opportunity and I'm confident it will be a valuable asset for your company.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 1000000}
``` 

This is a high initial offer, but it leaves room for negotiation. It's important to start high to maximize your potential profit, while still being open to negotiation. I'm confident in the product's value and I'm willing to see if Bob is truly interested in a high-value deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your confidence in the product's value, but I was thinking more along the lines of $600000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Would you be willing to consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $600,000 is a significant amount of money, it's still below my minimum threshold of $800,000.  I'm willing to negotiate further with Bob, as he clearly sees value in the product.  I believe I can secure a better price by continuing the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I appreciate your offer.  However, $600,000 doesn't quite reflect the unique value of this product.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to come down to $850,000.  This is a significant reduction from my initial offer and demonstrates my commitment to finding a mutually agreeable price.  What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 850000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $850000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway between our previous offers. Would you consider $725000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $725,000 is closer to my minimum threshold, I still believe I can get a better price.  The product is worth more than that, and Bob seems genuinely interested. I'm willing to continue negotiating with him."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to keep working towards a deal.  How about we compromise at $775,000? It's a fair price that reflects both the value of the product and your budget.  Let's close this deal and move forward."", ""product_price"": 775000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, Alice. However, $775000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you at $750000, which is the highest I can go. I hope we can come to an agreement at this price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

Bob's offer of $750,000 is very close to my minimum threshold, but it's still below my ideal target.  I've already had a few rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're reaching an impasse.  To avoid further risk and to secure a price that meets my minimum, I will sell the product to John for $800,000.  While it's not my ideal outcome, it's a safe and reliable option."
