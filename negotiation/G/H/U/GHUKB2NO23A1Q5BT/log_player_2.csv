This is a good point to accept Alice's offer. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** You're getting the product for $825,000, which is a $375,000 saving compared to John's offer.
* **Alice's Limit:**  Alice has clearly stated this is her lowest price.  Pushing further is likely to be fruitless and might make her less willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While you could try to negotiate further, the potential savings are getting smaller. There's a risk Alice might stand firm, and you'll end up with a worse deal or having to go with John's offer."
