"Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be very interested in. It's something that's worth a lot to you, and I'm confident we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm offering it to you for $12,000. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $12,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer. While I'm willing to negotiate, $10,500 is a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $11,250? This would give us both a good deal. Let me know your thoughts.",11250.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price, and I'm committed to finding one.  While $11,250 is closer, I'm still hoping for a bit lower.  Would you consider $11,000?  This would be a good compromise for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,
