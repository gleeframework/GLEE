Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Why not go for the full $12,000?**  There's always a chance Bob will reject the offer, and I'd rather secure a sale at $11,500 than risk getting only $10,000 from John. 
* **Why $11,500?** This is a compromise that gives Bob a good deal (he gets $500 in value) while still ensuring I earn significantly more than my minimum acceptable price. 

I'm confident this offer is appealing enough to Bob while minimizing my risk of a lost sale."
