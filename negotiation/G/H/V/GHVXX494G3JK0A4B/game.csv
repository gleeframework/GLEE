"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but  $925,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $750,000?",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $890,000 is still a bit high for my budget. Could we agree on $800,000?",800000.0,Bob,4,
