"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While the product seems interesting,  $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider a price closer to $8,000?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $14,000 might be a bit high for you, Bob, but I'd like to find a mutually beneficial price. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $11,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",11000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  However, I'm still finding it a bit high. Would you be willing to go down to $9,500? That would be a comfortable price point for me.",9500.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob! I can see that $9,500 is a bit of a stretch for me, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle again. How about we try $10,500? I think that's a fair price considering the product's value to you.",10500.0,Alice,5,
