Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident it will exceed your expectations. I'm asking for $925,000. Let me know your decision."", 
""product_price"": 925000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing Bob's Valuation:** We have the advantage of knowing Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **Maximizing Profit:** We want to get as close to his valuation as possible without pushing him away.
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** While the offer is high, it leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, making him feel like he's getting a better deal.
* **Alternative Option:** We have a guaranteed sale at $800,000 to John, so we don't want to go below that price.

This strategy aims to strike a balance between maximizing profit and ensuring Bob accepts the offer."
