"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I'm open to discussing this further, so please let me know your thoughts.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I acknowledge the product's value, $1,100,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'd be happy to purchase the product for $800,000.  Let me know what you think.",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $800,000 is significantly below its true value.  How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? This reflects the product's worth while still offering you a fair deal.",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $850,000. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price considering the value we both recognize in this product.",850000.0,Bob,4,
