"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest in the product.  Given its value and potential, I'm offering it to you at $1,100,000. I believe this price reflects its true worth and allows for a fair and profitable deal for both of us.",1100000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but unfortunately it's still a bit higher than I'm able to go at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for the product.  This would still give you a good return on your investment while allowing me to acquire it within my budget. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but the $850,000 offer is significantly below its true value.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is my final offer, and I believe it represents a fair compromise for both of us.",1025000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,025,000 is still outside of my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $900,000 for the product. This is a significant increase from my previous offer and demonstrates my genuine interest in acquiring it. I believe this price is fair and allows for a mutually beneficial deal. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, we're getting closer.  To show I'm serious about making this work, I'm willing to drop my price to $980,000. This is a significant concession on my end and reflects my desire to close this deal. Let me know if this works for you.",980000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate, but I'm still not quite there yet. I'm going to stick with my previous offer of $900,000. This is a fair price that allows us both to walk away happy.  Let's make this happen!",900000.0,Bob,6,
