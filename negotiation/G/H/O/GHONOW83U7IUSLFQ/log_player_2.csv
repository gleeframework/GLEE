"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a competitive price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is below your maximum value, it's still a significant price. There's room for negotiation, and you can likely get a better deal. You have 10 rounds, so it's worth trying to get a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this moment. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving in the right direction with her offer, but it's still higher than what I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to keep negotiating to see if I can get a price closer to my target of $10,000. I have 7 rounds left, so I have time to negotiate."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your original asking price and my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is getting closer to my desired price, but I'm still not quite there. We've both made concessions, and I believe we can find a price that works for both of us with continued negotiation. I have 5 rounds left, so there's still time to find a mutually agreeable solution."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit. I'm offering $10,750 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $10,750 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,900. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,900
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,900 is getting very close to my target of $10,000.  While I could try to squeeze out a few more dollars by counter-offering, it's becoming risky. With only 3 rounds left, I'm worried that:

* Alice might get stubborn and refuse to budge further.
*  I might be left with no choice but to buy from John at the higher price of $15,000.

It's better to secure the product at a price I'm happy with, rather than risk losing the deal altogether."
