"Hello Bob, thank you for considering my product! I'm excited to offer it to you at a competitive price. After careful consideration, I'm willing to sell it to you for $12,000. This is a great deal, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that benefits both of us.",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you considering my budget. However, $12,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. This would still be a good profit for you, and it's the highest I can go at this moment. Let me know your thoughts.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $10,000 is a bit below my target, but I'm willing to compromise. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,500. This is still a good deal for both of us, and I believe it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. Let me know your thoughts.",11500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,500 is still outside of my budget. I'm prepared to offer $10,500 for the product. This is a fair price, considering your original asking price and my budget. I'm confident we can find a solution that benefits both of us.",10500.0,Bob,4,

"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I understand that $10,500 is still a bit below my target, but I'm willing to consider it. However, I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price for the product. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $11,000. This is a compromise that I believe is reasonable, considering the product's value to you and my original asking price. Let me know your thoughts.",11000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your continued willingness to negotiate.  While $11,000 is closer, I'm still at my limit. I'm offering $10,750 for the product. This represents a significant compromise on my end, and I'm confident it's a fair price that allows us to reach an agreement.  What do you think?",10750.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not convinced that $10,750 is a fair price for the product, considering its value to you. After re-evaluating the market, I'm willing to sell the product to you for $10,900. This is a final offer, and I'm confident that it's a reasonable compromise that benefits both of us.
