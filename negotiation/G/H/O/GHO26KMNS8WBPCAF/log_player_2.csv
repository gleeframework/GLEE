{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

It's too early to accept Alice's offer.  Since you're willing to pay up to $120, it makes sense to try to negotiate a lower price."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $100. This is a significant discount from Alice's initial price, but still within my budget.  I'm hoping this will encourage Alice to negotiate further."

While Alice's offer is getting closer to my limit, I'm still going to try for a lower price. I'll counter again in the next round."
