"Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000.  It's a great deal for both of us, considering it's worth $15,000 to you.  Let me know what you think!",13000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $12,000, which is still a fair price considering the value you'll get.  Let's meet in the middle!",12000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $12,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $11,000. How about $11,250?",11250.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm glad we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $11,500, but that's my final offer.  It's a great price for you, and it's a fair compromise for me.  What do you say?",11500.0,Alice,5,
