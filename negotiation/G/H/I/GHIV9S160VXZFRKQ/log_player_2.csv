"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,500. It's a great deal for you, as it's worth $10,000 to you, and I'm sure you'll find it very useful.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While Alice's offer is within Bob's budget, it's not the best deal. There's room for negotiation, and Bob can potentially get a better price by rejecting and counter-offering."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. While I appreciate your product, $11,500 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $10,500.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 10500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,500 is just too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $11,000.  This gives you a good price and still allows me to get a fair value for the product.  What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has lowered her price, it's still above Bob's desired price point.  Bob can likely still negotiate a lower price. He has a good chance of getting closer to his target price of $10,000 by continuing negotiations."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $11,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm happy to meet you halfway at $10,750.  Let's see if we can make this happen."", ""product_price"": 10750}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're trying to get the best deal, but $10,750 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $11,250. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is still focused on saving as much money as possible. While Alice is getting closer to his desired price, there's still room for negotiation.  By continuing to negotiate, Bob could potentially get a price even lower than $11,250."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $11,250 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm happy to meet you halfway again at $11,000. This would be a fair price for both of us. Let's make this deal."", ""product_price"": 11000}
