"Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob can get the product for $1,000,000 from John.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price.  $950,000 is still too high."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to save as much money as possible.  $850,000 is a reasonable starting point for a counteroffer, as it's still above Alice's value for the product but significantly lower than the initial offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is lower than the initial offer, it's still significantly higher than Bob's desired price. There's still room for negotiation, and Bob should aim for a price closer to $850,000.  Buying from John for $1,000,000 is always an option if the negotiation with Alice fails, but it's still better to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to meet Alice halfway, offering a price that is closer to his desired price point of $850,000 but still higher than Alice's valuation of $800,000.  This is a reasonable counteroffer that shows Bob is willing to compromise, but still hopes to get a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $885,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $885,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $885,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's lower than the price he would pay from John, and it's closer to his desired price point of $850,000. Further negotiation could potentially result in a lower price, but the risk of Alice walking away or Bob needing to buy from John at a higher price is too high. It's better to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
