"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our product with you. After considering your interest, I'm willing to offer it to you for $1,200,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000. I believe this is a fair starting point for our negotiation.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $1,200,000 is a bit too high for me at this time. I'm willing to offer $1,050,000 for the product, which is still a substantial profit for you. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,050,000. Considering the product's value to you is $1,500,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a fair price, taking into account the value you place on the product and the potential profit for me.",1300000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $1,300,000 is still outside my budget. I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000. This is a fair price that benefits both of us. If we can agree on this, we can finalize the deal quickly. ",1150000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your position, Bob, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm not willing to sell the product for $1,150,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I need to get closer to my target price. I'll offer you the product for $1,250,000. This is a fair price, considering the product's value to you and the potential profit for me.",1250000.0,Alice,5,
