Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer I'd suggest:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,500,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Value:**  The product is worth $1,200,000 to Bob. He'll only accept an offer equal to or less than this amount.
* **Zone of Potential Agreement (ZOPA):** The prices at which a deal is possible exist between $1,200,001 and $1,499,999.  

**Strategy**

You want to start high within the ZOPA to maximize your potential profit. However, you also want to give Bob a reason to accept rather than risk you selling to John.

**The Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to acquire this product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm offering it at $1,450,000.  This is a limited-time offer as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **High but Reasonable:** $1,450,000 is a strong starting point within the ZOPA. It leaves room for potential negotiation while aiming for significant profit.
* **Scarcity and Urgency:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" and a ""limited-time offer"" encourages Bob to act quickly and potentially avoid losing the deal.

**Important Note:**  This is just the opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. He might counter-offer, and you'll need to decide how much you're willing to lower your price to secure the sale."
