"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this fantastic product! I've priced it at $18,000, reflecting its true value. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $18,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $18,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  $18,000 is far above his budget, and he can get the product for $10,000 from John.  It's worth negotiating with Alice to see if he can get a better price, but he shouldn't commit to anything until he knows what kind of deal he can get."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, Thanks for the offer. $18,000 is a bit out of my range. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product, which is fair considering its value to me. Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 10000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your reply. I understand your perspective, but $18,000 is really my bottom line. How about we meet in the middle at $14,000? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $14,000 is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above what he's willing to pay.  He should continue negotiating to try and get a lower price, as he has the option to buy from John for a much lower amount."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price, but $14,000 is still too high for me.  I'm happy to pay $12,000, which is a fair compromise.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 12000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you're getting closer! I'm willing to come down a bit more, but $12,000 is really pushing it. How about we settle at $13,000 and call it a deal? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should reject Alice's offer. He's getting closer to his budget, but $13,000 is still more than he wants to pay. He should keep negotiating to see if he can get an even lower price. He's in a strong position because he can always buy the product from John for $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, we're getting closer, but I'm still not there.  I can pay $12,500, which is a fair middle ground. Let's make this deal happen."", ""product_price"": 12500}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, you clearly see the value in this product. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. How about we split the difference and say $12,750? That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,750
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob should still reject the offer.  While it's getting closer to his budget, he's still better off buying from John for $10,000.  There are still a few rounds left to negotiate, and it's likely he can get Alice to come down further, or at least try."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 8
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand you're firm on your price, but I'm still not there. I'm happy to pay $12,000.  This is a fair price considering we've both been willing to negotiate.  Let's wrap this up."", ""product_price"": 12000}
