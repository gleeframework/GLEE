Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm starting with a price of $100. This is higher than my minimum value of $80, but it leaves room for negotiation if Bob is interested.  I want to see if I can get a good price, but I'm also prepared to potentially lower my offer if Bob counter-offers."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
While Bob's offer is my minimum, I'm going to try and push for a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if I can meet in the middle."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm going to counteroffer with $90. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  I'm hoping this shows I'm willing to negotiate, but also that I value the product at more than Bob's initial offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $85 is very close to my minimum acceptable price.  It's better than John's offer, and I don't want to risk losing a sale altogether by pushing for more."
