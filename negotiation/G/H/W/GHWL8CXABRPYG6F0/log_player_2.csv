"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,500. It's a fantastic deal, and I believe you'll find it's worth every penny.  Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can likely get a better deal by negotiating further.  Since the product is worth $12,000 to Alice, there's room to bargain."

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position.  I'm willing to come down a bit to $14,000.  This is a fair price, considering the value this product offers you. What do you say? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Bob should continue to negotiate.  While $14,000 is a better price than Alice's initial offer, there is still some room to bring the price down further.  Since Bob is willing to pay up to $15,000, there's still a range to negotiate within."
