"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. I understand its worth to you is around $800000, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a significant discount from its true value to me, but I'm confident it's a fair price considering its potential benefits for your business. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing this further. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000.
