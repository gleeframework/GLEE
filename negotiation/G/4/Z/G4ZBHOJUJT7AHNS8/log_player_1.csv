Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?

I'm going to reject Bob's offer.  While I'm open to negotiation, his offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price.  I'm confident I can get closer to my desired value with further negotiation."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the pricing, but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to be closer to my initial asking price to make this work.  I'm prepared to offer the product for $1,600,000.  This reflects the true value of the product, and I believe it's a fair compromise.  Let's see if we can find common ground."", ""product_price"": 1600000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer?

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While Bob's offer of $1,400,000 is getting closer, it's still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm not ready to sell at this point and I want to see if I can get a better deal."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $1,400,000, but I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's try $1,550,000. This would be a good compromise, as it's closer to your offer but still allows me to meet my minimum price. Let's make this happen!"", ""product_price"": 1550000}

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your perspective, Alice, but $1,550,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to compromise further and offer $1,450,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the market value of similar products. Can you consider my offer? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

While Bob is getting closer, it's becoming clear that he's not going to meet my minimum price. I've been pushing for a good deal, but I've reached my limit.  It's time to take John's offer and secure a deal that meets my needs."
