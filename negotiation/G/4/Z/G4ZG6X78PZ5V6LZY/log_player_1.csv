Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $13,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 13000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting at $13,000, which is slightly above Bob's perceived value. This gives me room to negotiate down if necessary.
* **Positive Tone:** The message is friendly and encouraging, aiming to build rapport and avoid a confrontational negotiation.
* **Backup Plan:** I'm aware of the alternative offer from John, providing me with a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but $13,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $11,500 for the product. Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $11,500 is below my minimum acceptable price of $12,000.
* **Room for negotiation:** While Bob has rejected my initial offer, he has shown interest in the product. This means there is still potential for a mutually agreeable price.
* **Opportunity to improve:**  By rejecting his offer, I can counter with a price closer to my desired range and see if we can reach a compromise.

**Next steps:** I will counter Bob's offer with a price slightly higher than $11,500 but still lower than my initial $13,000 offer. This will demonstrate my willingness to negotiate while also ensuring I don't sell below my minimum threshold."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer.  While I value our potential partnership, $11,500 is a bit low for me. How about we split the difference and go with $12,250?  This would be a fair price for both of us, and I believe you'll still find it a great deal."", ""product_price"": 12250}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting in the Middle:** By proposing $12,250, I'm offering a compromise that's exactly halfway between my previous offer ($13,000) and Bob's offer ($11,500). This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet him halfway.
* **Maintaining a Fair Value:** This price is still above my minimum acceptable price of $12,000, ensuring I don't sell the product at a loss.
* **Positive and Collaborative Tone:**  The message uses positive language (""fair price for both of us"") to maintain a collaborative tone and encourage Bob to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your position, but $12,250 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $12,000, which is my absolute limit. Let's meet in the middle and close this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting my Minimum:**  Bob's offer of $12,000 meets my minimum acceptable price.  There's no point in further negotiation since I'm already at my lower limit.
* **No room for improvement:**  Continuing negotiations risks losing the deal altogether, as Bob has stated his ""absolute limit."" 
* **Secure Sale:** Accepting Bob's offer ensures a quick and guaranteed sale at my minimum price.

While I'd prefer to earn more, the risk of a longer negotiation (and potentially losing the deal altogether) outweighs the potential for a slightly higher price.  It's crucial to balance potential gains with the risk of losing a sale."
