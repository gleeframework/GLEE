Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product to you first. I think it's fantastic and worth every penny of $175. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  It's always best to start negotiations a bit higher than your minimum acceptable price. This leaves room for negotiation if Bob tries to haggle. 
* **Gauging Interest:** By offering the product at $175, we can see how interested Bob is. If he accepts immediately, we've made a great profit. If he rejects or counter-offers, we know he's price-sensitive.
* **Backup Plan:** We have a guaranteed sale at $150 with John, so there's no risk of losing money. This allows us to be more confident in our negotiation with Bob."
