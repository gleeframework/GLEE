"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $850,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $950,000.  It's still a great deal for you, considering the value you'll get from the product. What do you say?",950000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but $950,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000.  This is a fair price for both of us, and it allows me to stay within my budget.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",900000.0,Bob,4,
