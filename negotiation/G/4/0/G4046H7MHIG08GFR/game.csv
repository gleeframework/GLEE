"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I think $2,000,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for it. Can you consider this offer?",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you countering. That said, $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to come down to $1,750,000.  I believe this price reflects a more accurate valuation while still leaving room for a mutually beneficial deal.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the revised offer, Alice. While I appreciate the willingness to come down, I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $1,400,000 for the product. Can you consider this offer?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
