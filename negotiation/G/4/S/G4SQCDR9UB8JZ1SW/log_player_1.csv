Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its potential value to someone with your expertise, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth and the benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Aim high to maximize potential profit. Bob is willing to pay $1,200,000, so starting closer to that figure is advantageous.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While the offer is high, it leaves a small margin for Bob to potentially negotiate down, making him feel like he's getting a slightly better deal.
* **Strong Initial Stance:** A strong initial offer can anchor the negotiation in your favor. 
* **Backup Plan:** You have John as a guaranteed backup at $800,000, so there's less risk in aiming high with Bob."
