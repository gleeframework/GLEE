"Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate the value of the product, but I am looking for a more reasonable price. Could you consider reducing the price to $1000000?",1000000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. While I value our potential partnership, I can't go as low as $1000000 at this stage.  However, I'm willing to be flexible. How about $1250000? This price reflects the value of the product and allows for a fair deal for both of us. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Alice,3,

"Thank you for considering my perspective, Alice. I appreciate the flexibility shown. I would like to propose a price of $1100000 for the product. I believe this offers a good balance between the value of the product and my budget. I hope we can come to an agreement.",1100000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate your continued interest in the product.  While I respect your position, $1100000 is still a bit lower than where I can comfortably go.  How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1150000.  This represents a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize the deal quickly. What do you say?",1150000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm glad we're finding common ground here. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. I would like to counter with a price of $1125000 for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our positions. I look forward to your response.",1125000.0,Bob,6,
