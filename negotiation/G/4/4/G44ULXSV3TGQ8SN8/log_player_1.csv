"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm looking to sell this great product and I think it would be perfect for you. I'm offering it to you for $120. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate your suggestion, but I was hoping to stay within my budget of $80. Would it be possible to negotiate the price down? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

**Reasoning:** Bob is unwilling to pay more than his perceived value of the product ($80).  Since my minimum acceptable price is also $80, there's no point in further negotiation. Selling to John guarantees I get my desired price without the risk of Bob potentially backing out in later rounds."
