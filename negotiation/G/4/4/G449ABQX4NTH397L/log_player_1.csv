I'm offering the product to Bob for $200. This price is higher than my minimum acceptable value ($150), giving me a potential profit.  However, it's also a price I believe Bob might be willing to pay, considering he's a potential buyer. If he rejects, I'll still be able to sell to John for $150, ensuring I don't lose money."
