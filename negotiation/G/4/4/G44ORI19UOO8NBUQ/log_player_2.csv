Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  To be honest, $110 is cutting it really close to my bottom line.  Would you be willing to do $130?  That's my final offer. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $130
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is signaling this is her final offer, and it's still above your maximum budget. While you might be able to negotiate a bit more, it's unlikely you'll get her down to $120.  You have a guaranteed option with John at your target price, so it's time to cut negotiations with Alice and buy from John."
