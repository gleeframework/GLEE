Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for the offer. I understand the value of the product to me is high, but I am hoping to keep the price under $12000. Would you be willing to consider $11000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my target price.  I still believe there is room to negotiate."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I can't go as low as $11,000. How about we split the difference and agree on $11,250? This would still be a great deal for you, and it's a fair compromise. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11250}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the effort to find a middle ground. Considering my budget constraints, I would like to propose $11125 as the price for the product. I hope this proposal is acceptable. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,125. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,125
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer a slightly higher price,  $11,125 is a good deal considering it's just $125 less than my target price and I'm already on round 4.  There's a risk that Bob will continue to lower his offer, and I don't want to risk getting a lower price or running out of rounds and having to sell to John for $10,000."
