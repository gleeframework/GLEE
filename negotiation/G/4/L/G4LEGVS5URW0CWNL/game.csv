"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $950000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I'm hoping we can meet somewhere in the middle. How about $1050000? This gives you a significant discount from my initial offer while still ensuring I receive a fair price for my product.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
