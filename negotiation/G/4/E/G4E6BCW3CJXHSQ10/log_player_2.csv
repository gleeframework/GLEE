# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $1,200,000 is less than John's price of $1,500,000, it's still significantly higher than the product's value to Alice ($800,000). This suggests there's room for negotiation. By rejecting the offer, you signal to Alice that you're looking for a better price, increasing the chances of getting the product for less than $1,200,000.  Even if Alice doesn't budge, you can always fall back on buying from John."
