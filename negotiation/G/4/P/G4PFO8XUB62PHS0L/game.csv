"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think you'll really love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120.",120.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I'm interested, but $120 is a bit more than I'm willing to pay right now. How about $100? I think that's a fair price for both of us.",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob. However, I've invested a lot in this product, and I need to make a profit. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go as low as $110. That's the best I can do.",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $110 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with. How about $105? That's a fair price for both of us and gets us closer to a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to meet in the middle, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing money on this deal. I can do $108, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. After that, I'm going to have to consider other options.",108.0,Alice,5,
