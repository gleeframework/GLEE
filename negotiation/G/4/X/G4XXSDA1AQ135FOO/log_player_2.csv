Bob should reject the offer.  $10,000 is still too high for him, and he can likely get a better price by counter-offering."

Alice's offer:

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While $10,500 is better than $12,000, Bob can still potentially get a better deal by counter-offering and trying to negotiate further."

Bob should choose to buy the product from John for $12,000.  At this point, Alice is holding firm at $11,000 and Bob's counteroffers haven't been successful.  While John's price is higher, it's still a better deal than Alice's current offer. Bob is getting closer to his target price of $8,000, but the negotiation isn't making significant progress.  It's better to secure the product from John rather than risk further negotiation with Alice."
