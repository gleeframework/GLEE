"Alice, thanks for the opening offer. I see the value in the product, but that price point is a bit high for me.  I'd be willing to purchase it for $850,000. What do you think?",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product, but $850,000 is significantly below its true value. I'm willing to compromise, but let's find a price that reflects the benefits you'll gain from it.  I'm offering $1,050,000.  This is a fair price for both of us.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price that reflects the product's value.  I'm serious about buying it, but $1,050,000 is still a bit beyond my budget. How about we meet in the middle at $925,000? ",925000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I'm willing to come down a little further, but $925,000 is still not enough.  I'm offering $975,000. This is a very fair price considering the benefits you will receive from this product. Let's finalize this deal.",975000.0,Alice,5,
