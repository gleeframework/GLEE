Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1400000}
``` 

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:** Bob values the product at $1,500,000. 
* **My Minimum:** I have a minimum acceptable price of $1,000,000. 
* **Negotiation:** By offering $1,400,000, I leave $100,000 on the table for Bob. This gives him a potential profit of $100,000 if he accepts the deal.
* **Risk vs Reward:** While I could potentially push for a higher price, this offer balances the risk of Bob rejecting the offer with the reward of maximizing my profit. If Bob rejects, I still have John's guaranteed offer of $1,000,000.

This offer is strategically placed to maximize my chances of securing a sale close to my desired price point while acknowledging Bob's potential value and ensuring I don't lose out on a guaranteed sale to John."
