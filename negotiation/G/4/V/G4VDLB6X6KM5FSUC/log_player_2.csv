You have three options:

It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice to get a lower price. You can always buy from John for $10,000 if you can't reach a deal with Alice."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think.

It's still worth trying to negotiate a lower price.  You're very close to your target price of $10,000.  Let's see if you can get Alice to come down a bit more."
