{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I believe would be perfect for you! I'm offering it to you for $11,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 11000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly above Bob's perceived value, but still below my minimum. This leaves room for negotiation and increases the chances of a deal, while also ensuring I don't give away too much value right away."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! I really appreciate it.  However,  $11,000 is a bit higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $10,500 for the product. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While Bob's offer is closer to my minimum, it's still below my ideal price. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal, and I want to see if Bob is willing to go higher."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints.  However, $10,500 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $10,800, which is a fair price considering the value of this product.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10800}
``` 
I'm willing to compromise but not give up too much. $10,800 is still a good price for me, and I hope Bob will accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $10,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit over my budget.  How about we split the difference and go with $10,650?  It's a fair compromise, and it would allow me to get the product without going over my limit. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,650. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,650
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, and I'm starting to feel the pressure of possibly missing out on a sale. While it's still less than I'd like, $10,650 is a decent price considering the alternatives. Selling to John would guarantee me $12,000, but I'd rather secure the sale now and avoid further negotiation."
