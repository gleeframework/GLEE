"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the purchase of this amazing product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it. As a starting point, I'm willing to offer it to you for $6,500. This is a great deal, considering the product's true value is $8,000. What do you think?",6500.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $6,500 is a bit high for me. Would you consider $5,000?",5000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm afraid $5,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value is $8,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about we try $6,250? It's a fair compromise, and I think you'll be happy with the deal.",6250.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you moving closer to my budget.  While $6,250 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $5,500. Would that work for you?",5500.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking to get closer to your budget, but I'm still not comfortable going below $6,500. Considering our previous offers, I'm willing to make a slight adjustment. How about we meet at $6,375? It's a small concession, but I think it's a fair compromise.",6375.0,Alice,5,
