Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product and I think it would be a great fit for you.  I'm willing to let it go for $110. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 110}
``` 

This is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's a reasonable offer:** It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **It shows you're willing to negotiate:** By offering a price lower than your minimum, you demonstrate flexibility.
* **It includes a friendly message:** This helps build rapport and sets a positive tone for the negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice.  That's a bit high for me right now. Would you consider $65? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $65. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $65
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price of $120. While selling to John for $120 is tempting, I'm still hoping to get closer to my desired price.  I'm going to counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest,  $65 is a little too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $90.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand, $90 is closer but I'm trying to stick to a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $75? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $75 is closer to my minimum price, it's still significantly lower than what I'd like to get.  I'm going to counteroffer one more time. If Bob doesn't budge, I'll go with John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate you coming up on your offer. However, $75 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you halfway at $85. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 85}
