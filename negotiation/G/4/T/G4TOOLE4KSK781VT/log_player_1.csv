"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this fantastic product. I'm asking for $100 for it. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

I'm starting with a high price of $100, as it gives me room to negotiate. I want to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium for the product. I'm also being friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I'm only willing to pay $80 for it. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $80 is my minimum, I'm not willing to sell for that price right away. I'm going to try to get a bit closer to my desired price.  I'll counteroffer and see where things go."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. While I appreciate your interest, $80 is a bit too low for me right now. I'm willing to come down to $90. How does that sound?"", ""product_price"": 90} 
``` 
I'm lowering my price a bit to $90, but I'm still holding out for more than my minimum.  I'm hoping that a slight compromise will entice Bob to agree."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate it. I'd like to counter with $85 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum and I'm running out of time.  It's better to secure the sale at $85 than risk a lower counteroffer or having to sell to John for $80."
