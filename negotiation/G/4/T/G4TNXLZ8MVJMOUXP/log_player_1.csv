Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 20000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is significantly higher than my minimum but still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping to gauge Bob's interest and see if he's willing to pay a premium for the product.  If he rejects, I'll need to assess his counteroffer and decide whether to continue negotiations or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is my minimum acceptable price, but I'm not willing to accept it right away.  I'd like to see if I can get a higher price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 17500}
```

I'm counteroffering at $17,500. This is a compromise, offering a bit more than Bob's offer while still leaving room for further negotiation if necessary. I'm hoping to find a middle ground that we both can agree on."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is $1,000 higher than my minimum, and I'm comfortable accepting it.  It's a better deal than selling to John and it seems likely that further negotiations will only lead to a lower price."
