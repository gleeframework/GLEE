"Hello Bob, thank you for considering our product! We're excited to discuss the details with you. As a starting point, we're willing to offer you the product at a price of $800,000. We believe this is a competitive offer, and we're confident you'll find it hard to beat.",800000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $800,000 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to offer you $950,000 for the product. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",950000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. We appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, we're not quite ready to accept $950,000. We're willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product at $900,000. We believe this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate further.  I'm still not quite there at $900,000. I'm willing to go to $925,000. This is a good price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal. Let's see if we can find a compromise here.",925000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your revised offer, Bob. We're getting close, but we're still not quite there. We're willing to meet you at $915,000. We think this is a fair price considering the value of the product to both of us. Let's see if we can finalize the deal.",915000.0,Alice,5,
