Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $9,500.  It's a great deal, and I think you'll find it very valuable.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:** $9,500 is a good starting point. It's a significant discount from my minimum price ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation.
* **Message:** The message is friendly and encourages Bob to consider the offer. It highlights the value of the product.

**Strategy:**

I'm aiming for a price as close to my minimum value ($10,000) as possible. By starting at $9,500, I leave room for Bob to counteroffer without feeling like he's getting a bad deal.  If Bob rejects, I can lower the price slightly in subsequent counteroffers, but I'll always have the option to sell to John for $10,000 if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $7,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $7,000 is significantly below my minimum value of $10,000.  While I'm open to negotiation, this offer is too low to consider.  I'll reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round. 

**Reasoning:**

* **Value:** My minimum value for the product is $10,000.  $7,000 is too big of a loss.
* **Negotiation:**  I'm willing to negotiate but need to find a price closer to my minimum.
* **John's Offer:** I have a guaranteed offer from John for $10,000, which is a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the counteroffer.  While I appreciate your interest, $7,000 is too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $8,500, which is still a great deal considering the value of this product.  Let's meet in the middle!"", ""product_price"": 8500}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Price:**  $8,500 is a compromise between my minimum value ($10,000) and Bob's offer ($7,000). It shows I'm willing to negotiate but still maintain a reasonable profit margin.
* **Message:** The message is friendly but firm. It acknowledges Bob's offer while emphasizing the value of the product and the potential for a mutually beneficial deal.

**Strategy:**

This counteroffer aims to:

* **Show willingness to negotiate:**  Lowering the price shows Bob that I'm serious about selling and willing to find common ground.
* **Maintain my profit margin:**  $8,500 is still a respectable profit, even though it's less than my ideal price.
* **Entice Bob to accept:**  By presenting it as a ""meeting in the middle,"" I hope to make the offer more appealing to Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. I'm trying to stick to a tight budget, would you be willing to meet in the middle at $8,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $8,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $8,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Value:** Bob's offer of $8,000 is still below my desired minimum of $10,000, but it's significantly closer than his previous offer and represents a $1,000 profit for me.
* **Negotiation:** We've been going back and forth, and this feels like a reasonable compromise. 
* **Risk:** There's always the chance that I could get a better offer from Bob, but I also run the risk of him walking away altogether. 

**Decision:**

Accepting Bob's offer at $8,000 is a good compromise. It's a relatively quick and easy deal, and it's a better outcome than selling to John for $10,000, as it reduces the time and effort needed to negotiate further. While it's not my ideal price, it's still a profitable sale."
