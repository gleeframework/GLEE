"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the product's value, but $130 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with at the moment.  I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your position, but $100 is a bit too low for me. Could you do $115? That would be a fair compromise.",115.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit. $115 is still a little high for me, but I'm willing to go up to $110.  Let's see if we can settle on that.",110.0,Bob,4,
