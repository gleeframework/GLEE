"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product. Given its incredible potential and value, I'm proposing a starting price of $1,300,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth in the current market.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I agree the product has potential, that price is a little high for me. I'd be willing to pay $900,000.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer. I'm willing to come down a bit, but $900,000 is significantly below its true value. How about we meet in the middle at $1,100,000?",1100000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $1,100,000 is getting closer, but it's still a bit too high for my budget.  Would you consider $950,000?",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, it seems like we are getting closer. I'm willing to accept a slightly lower profit margin to close this deal. How about $1,050,000? This is my final offer.",1050000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the response. I understand this is your final offer, and it's not that far off from what I'm willing to pay. If you could do $1,000,000, I can close the deal right now.",1000000.0,Bob,6,
