"Hello Bob, I'm delighted to offer you the opportunity to purchase this exceptional product. Given its unique value and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this represents a fair starting point for our discussion.",1100000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice,  $1,100,000 is a bit high for me.  I'm really interested in this product, but my budget is capped at $800,000.  I'd be willing to pay $850,000 for it.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 significantly undervalues the product's true worth.  To move us closer to a deal, I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This price reflects the immense value this product will bring to your business.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I understand your perspective, $1,000,000 is still out of my range.  I'm willing to go up to $900,000, which I believe is a fair price considering the potential benefits of this product.  Let's work towards a compromise.",900000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing your commitment to acquiring this product, and I want to find a solution that works for both of us. My final offer is $950,000. This is a significant reduction on my part, and I believe it reflects a fair deal considering the value this product brings.",950000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I truly appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  $950,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm firm on my budget of $800,000. If you're serious about selling, I'm prepared to go up to $850,000.  Let's see if we can find a way to make this work.",850000.0,Bob,6,
