"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase my product for a price of $1,450,000. This is a significant value for you, as it's well below its worth to you.  I'm confident this is a deal you won't want to miss. If you decline, I will be selling it to another buyer for a slightly lower price. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,450,000

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is better than John's:**  While Alice's offer is higher than her value of $1,200,000, it's still $50,000 less than buying from John.
* **You save money:**  By accepting Alice's offer, you save $50,000 compared to buying from John."
