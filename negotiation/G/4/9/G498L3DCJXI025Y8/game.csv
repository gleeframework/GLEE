"Hi Alice, thank you for your offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $105. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value.",105.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I'm open to negotiation, $105 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let me know if you're interested in this price.",110.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, thank you for your counteroffer. I'm still a bit hesitant to pay $110. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $105 again, as I think it's a fair price considering the product's value. If you're willing to meet me halfway, I'd be happy to make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
