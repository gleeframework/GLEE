Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe is quite valuable. I'm willing to offer it to you for $20,000.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 20000}
``` 

This offer starts at a price higher than your minimum but still leaves room for negotiation.  This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Bob's interest:** His response will tell you if he's even in the ballpark.
* **Leave room for compromise:** You can adjust your price if Bob's counteroffer is reasonable. 
* **Set the tone:** You're showing you value the product and are open to negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $20000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with right now. I'd be willing to pay $15000 for it.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $15,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $15,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is your minimum acceptable price, there's a chance you can get more.  By rejecting his offer:

* **You signal your willingness to negotiate:** You haven't given up on the deal and are still open to finding a price that works for both of you.
* **You maintain leverage:**  You control the next move and can potentially drive the price up.

**Next Step:** You'll need to send a counteroffer to Bob. Since you're aiming for the highest possible price, you'll want to counter with something slightly higher than his offer, but still less than your initial offer.  A reasonable counteroffer might be around $17,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for your offer. I appreciate your interest in the product.  While I'm willing to negotiate, $15,000 is a bit too low for me at this point.  I'm willing to come down to $17,000.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 17000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** This offer is higher than Bob's offer, but lower than your initial offer, showing a willingness to compromise.
* **Reasoning:** This price keeps the negotiation moving and leaves room for further negotiation, if needed. 
* **Message:** The message is friendly, acknowledging Bob's offer and expresses your willingness to negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price.  $17000 is still a bit high for me.  Would you consider $16000? That's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $16,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $16,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Target:**  Bob's offer is only $1,000 less than your last counteroffer, putting you very close to your desired price.
* **Risk vs. Reward:**  While you could try to negotiate further, the risk of Bob walking away and you having to settle with John for $15,000 is too high.  
* **Time and Effort:**  Continuing to negotiate could be time-consuming and may not result in a significantly higher price.

**Conclusion:** Accepting Bob's offer at $16,000 is the most pragmatic decision. It secures a good price for you while minimizing the risk of losing the deal."
