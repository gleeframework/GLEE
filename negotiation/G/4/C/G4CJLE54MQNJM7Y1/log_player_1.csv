Send your offer to Bob.,"{""product_price"": 2000000} 

I'm starting high, at $2,000,000. This leaves room for negotiation while still ensuring I get a good price. It's important to remember I have a backup buyer in John, so I don't need to settle for anything below my minimum value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,500,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,500,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

Bob's offer is my minimum value. However, I believe I can potentially get more. I'm going to reject his offer and make a counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1750000}
```

I'm going to counter with $1,750,000. This is a compromise, but it's still above my minimum and leaves room for further negotiation."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,600,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,600,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $1,600,000 is a good compromise. It's above my minimum value and a reasonable price. It's not worth risking further negotiation, especially since I have a guaranteed $1,500,000 from John."
