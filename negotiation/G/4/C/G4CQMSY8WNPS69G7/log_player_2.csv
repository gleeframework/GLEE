"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this great product! I think you'll really like it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent price, it's still higher than what the product is worth to Alice ($80). There's room for negotiation, and I want to see if I can get it for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate your enthusiasm. However, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $100 for it.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 100}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $100 is a bit lower than I was hoping for, but I'm willing to meet you in the middle. I can sell it to you for $115. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $115
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

$115 is a good compromise. It's within my budget and still a decent deal for Alice.  While I could continue negotiating, there's a risk Alice might reject further offers and I'd have to buy from John at a higher price."
