"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer.  While $12,000 is less than his maximum budget of $15,000, it's still a significant amount. Bob has 10 rounds to negotiate and can likely get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is aiming to save as much money as possible.  A counteroffer of $9,000 is a significant drop from Alice's initial $12,000 offer. This gives Alice room to negotiate while still leaving Bob with a good deal."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob should reject the offer. Although Alice has moved closer to Bob's desired price, there's still room for negotiation. With multiple rounds remaining, Bob can try to push for a lower price.  Buying from John at this point would be a waste of potential savings."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is gradually increasing his offer, but he's still aiming for a price lower than $11,000. This counteroffer of $10,000 keeps the negotiation moving while giving Alice a chance to meet Bob halfway."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $10,500 is very close to Bob's last counteroffer of $10,000. It's a good deal for Bob, saving him $4,500 compared to buying from John. While there are still rounds left, the risk of further negotiation falling apart is high. Accepting this offer secures a good price and avoids the potential for a worse outcome."
