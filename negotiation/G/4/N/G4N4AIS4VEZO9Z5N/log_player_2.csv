"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which I believe would significantly enhance your business operations. Given its exceptional value and quality, it's worth noting that this product holds a special significance for me, making its worth to me $12,000. However, considering its immense potential benefits for you, I am offering it to you at an exclusive price of $11,000. This offer is tailored to ensure you receive the best possible deal while maximizing my return on investment. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's story about the product's worth to her is interesting, it's irrelevant to your goal. You have a guaranteed option to buy the product for $12,000 from John.  By rejecting Alice's offer, you give yourself a chance to negotiate a lower price with her or proceed with your backup plan."
