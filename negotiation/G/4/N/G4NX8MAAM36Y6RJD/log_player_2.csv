Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at this price.

Alice is unlikely to go lower than $13,000.  Since you can get the product for $12,000 from John, it makes more sense to buy from John and save the extra $1,000."
