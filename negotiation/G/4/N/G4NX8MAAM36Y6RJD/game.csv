"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $18,000 is too high for me. I'm willing to pay $10,000 for this product. I believe this is a fair price considering its value and the current market.",10000.0,Bob,2,

"Hello Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $14,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this price is still a good deal for both of us.",14000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $14,000 is closer to what I had in mind, it's still a bit more than I'm comfortable spending. How about $11,000?  That feels like a fair compromise to me.",11000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $11,000 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $13,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you is $12,000. I believe this is a fair compromise, and I'm willing to meet you at this price.",13000.0,Alice,5,
