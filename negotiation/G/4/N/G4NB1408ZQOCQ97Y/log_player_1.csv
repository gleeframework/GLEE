Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, $900000 is a bit higher than I'd like to go at this point.  I'm confident we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $850000 for the product. This price reflects the value to me and allows for a fair profit for you.  What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.
