"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. How about we settle around $700,000? I believe that's a fair price.",700000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $700,000 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but let's meet in the middle. How about $850,000? This price still gives you a significant profit and allows me to get closer to my desired value.",850000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand you're looking for a price closer to your desired value.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for a price that's a bit more advantageous for me. Would you consider $750,000? That feels like a reasonable compromise.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective, but $750,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's try to find a middle ground.  I'm willing to lower my price to $800,000. This price is fair for both of us and allows us to finalize the deal.  Let me know your thoughts.",800000.0,Alice,5,
