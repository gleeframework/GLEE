"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of our premium product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we start our negotiation, I'm willing to offer it to you for $800,000. This is a competitive price, considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000. I'm open to further discussions, but I think this is a great starting point. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $800,000

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thank you for your counteroffer. I understand that $500,000 is a significant discount, but I'm still not willing to go that low. Considering the product's value to you is $1,200,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm offering it to you for $900,000. This is a fair price, considering the value you'll get from the product.

Alice's offer:

"Alice rejected your offer from round 6.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $700,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for that price. Considering the value you'll get from it, I'm willing to offer it to you for $725,000. This is my final offer, and I'm willing to walk away if you're not willing to meet me at this price.

This is a good deal for Bob. Here's why:

* **Significant Savings:** Bob is getting the product for $725,000, which is a $475,000 savings compared to John's offer. 
* **Alice's Final Offer:** Alice has signaled that this is her final offer and she's willing to walk away.  Continuing to push could result in losing the deal. 

While Bob might be able to get the price down a little more, the risk of losing the deal and having to buy from John at $1,200,000 is too great."
