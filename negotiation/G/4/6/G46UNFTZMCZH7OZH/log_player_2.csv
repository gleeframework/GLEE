"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you this incredible product! I believe it's a game-changer and I think you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a good price, it's still within the range of what I'm willing to pay. I'm not going to rush into buying from Alice just yet. I'll counteroffer and see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900,000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 750000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. After careful consideration, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $825000. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value I place on the product. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $825,000, which is a significant reduction from her initial offer of $900,000.  This is a good deal for me, and it's still a good bit lower than what I would pay John. There's always the chance I could get a lower price, but it's risky to keep negotiating. I'm happy to accept this offer."
