This is a great deal, considering its true value to me is $800000. I'm open to negotiations, but I'm confident you'll find this offer hard to beat.",900000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thank you for the offer.  $900000 is a good starting point, but I'd like to see if we can find a price that works for both of us. I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  I'm confident this is a fair price, considering the value I place on it. Let me know what you think.",750000.0,Bob,2,
