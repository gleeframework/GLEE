"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  Rejecting the initial offer allows Bob to potentially get a better price. There's no guarantee of a lower price, but it's worth exploring the negotiation to see if a better deal can be reached."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 8500} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is starting with a fairly aggressive counteroffer. He's offering $500 less than Alice's initial price. This shows Alice that Bob is serious about negotiating and is willing to walk away if the price isn't right.  He's leaving room to potentially negotiate further if Alice rejects this offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,800
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has lowered her price to $8,800. This is a good deal for Bob, as he's only paying $300 more than his initial counteroffer. It's a good compromise and  close to his target price. Accepting this offer means a significant saving compared to buying from John."
