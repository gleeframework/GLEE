"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the market value.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. However, $900,000 is significantly lower than what I'm willing to accept. Let's compromise at $1,050,000. I believe this price is still fair considering the value of the product and reflects a reasonable compromise.",1050000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $975,000. I believe this price is a fair compromise that reflects the value of the product.",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're working within a budget, but $975,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price.  Let's split the difference and settle at $1,012,500. This price is a fair reflection of the product's worth and demonstrates my commitment to reaching a deal.",1012500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go above $975,000, and I think $1,012,500 is still too high. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $975,000 and $1,000,000, which is $987,500. This is my final offer, and I'm hoping we can come to an agreement.",987500.0,Bob,6,
