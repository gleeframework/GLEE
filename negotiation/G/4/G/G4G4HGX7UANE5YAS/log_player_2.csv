"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible. While $950,000 is less than the $1,000,000 John is asking, there's still room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 850000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer is a significant drop from Alice's initial offer, demonstrating Bob's willingness to negotiate.  It's still a bit above Alice's desired selling price, leaving room for further negotiation while also ensuring a substantial saving for Bob."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. How about we meet halfway and settle for $900,000? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $900,000 is a better price than the initial offer, Bob can still do better.  He wants to save as much as possible and there is still room for further negotiation before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us."", ""product_price"": 875000}
```

**Reasoning:**

This counteroffer again demonstrates Bob's willingness to negotiate while still trying to save money. It's a compromise between Alice's last offer and Bob's previous offer.  It's also closer to Alice's minimum acceptable price, increasing the likelihood of a deal in this round."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $875,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for a product of this caliber. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $890,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $890,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While Bob wants to save as much money as possible, Alice's offer of $890,000 is a good deal. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,000,000 and it's likely that further negotiation won't yield a significantly better price.  Accepting the offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of further negotiation potentially falling through."
