"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its value, I believe a starting price of $950,000 is fair. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $950,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given its value to you, I'd be willing to pay $850,000. I believe this is a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, but $850,000 is cutting it too close to my minimum. How about we meet halfway and settle for $900,000? This way, we both walk away with a fair deal.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $900,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  Let's split the difference and go with $875,000.  This price reflects the value of the product for both of us.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm sensing we're getting close.  $875,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $890,000. This is my final offer, and I think it's a great deal for a product of this caliber.",890000.0,Alice,5,
