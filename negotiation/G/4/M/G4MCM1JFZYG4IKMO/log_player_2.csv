"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to show you this amazing product. I think it's worth a lot to you, but I'm willing to make a fair offer. I'm thinking of selling it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'm going to reject Alice's offer. $90 is still a bit higher than my target price of $100, so I want to see if I can get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I really appreciate it. However, $90 is still a bit higher than my budget. I'd be willing to pay $80 for the product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 80}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $90 might be a bit steep for you. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $85. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $85
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

I'll reject Alice's offer again. While $85 is closer to my target, I'm still hoping to get it for even less. I'll try to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but I'm still a bit over budget. I'm willing to pay $82.  This is my final offer.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 82}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $82. I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $84. It's a great deal, and I think you'll really love the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $84. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $84
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

This time, I'll accept Alice's offer.  $84 is still within my budget, and it seems like Alice is firm on her price.  It's better than going to John and paying $100."
