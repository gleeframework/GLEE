"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

The product is worth $1,000,000 to Alice, and she is offering it for $900,000. This suggests she's willing to negotiate. It's also a better deal than buying from John for $800,000. So, rejecting the offer and making a counteroffer is the most logical first step."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
``` 

I'm starting with a counteroffer of $850,000. This is a significant discount from Alice's offer, but still leaves some room for negotiation. It also reflects my budget constraint and sets a clear starting point for the negotiation."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $875,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $875,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Alice has come down to $875,000, which is within my budget and only $75,000 more than John's offer. Accepting her offer is the best option at this point. There's a chance I could get a better deal, but it's not worth the risk of further negotiation given the limited rounds and the possibility of losing the deal altogether."
