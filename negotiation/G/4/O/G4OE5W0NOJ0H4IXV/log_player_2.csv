"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm offering you a great deal on this product! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $150
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""} 

Alice's offer of $150 is significantly higher than your maximum budget of $80 and even higher than John's offer of $80. Buying from John is the most financially sound decision."
