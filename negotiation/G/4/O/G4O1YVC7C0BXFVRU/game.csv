"Hello Bob! I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a great opportunity for you to acquire this valuable asset. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,200,000. This is a very competitive price considering its true value is $1,500,000 to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"Alice, thanks for the offer. I understand the value of the product, but I'm working with a tighter budget.  Would you consider $650,000? I believe this is a fair offer considering my constraints.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $650,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $900,000. This is a fair compromise considering the product's value to both of us.",900000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway.  While $900,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I'm aiming for something more in the range of $725,000.  Would that be feasible for you?",725000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking for a better deal, Bob. However, $725,000 is still below my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to compromise further, but I need to stay above $850,000. I'm willing to offer the product to you for $850,000. This is the best I can do without going below my minimum.",850000.0,Alice,5,
