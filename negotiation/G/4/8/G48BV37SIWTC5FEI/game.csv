,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm really interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $8,000. I've done some research and I believe it's a fair price for the product. Would you be willing to meet me at this price?",8000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you've done your research, but I'm not willing to sell it to you for $8,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $10,000. It's still a great deal, considering the product's value to you.",10000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $10,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay $9,000 for the product. Can you consider this price?",9000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand that $9,000 is still a bit above your budget, Bob. However, I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm willing to sell it to you for $9,500. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the product's value to you.",9500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your concession, Alice, but $9,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $9,000, as I mentioned before. However, I'm willing to throw in an additional $500 for a total of $9,500 if you can throw in some extras or services that come with the product. Can you consider this offer?",9000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're looking for some extras, Bob. I'm willing to throw in a premium support package that includes dedicated customer service and priority updates for the next 6 months. This package is normally valued at $1,000, but I'm willing to include it in the deal for free if you're willing to meet me at $9,500. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",9500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate the offer of the premium support package, but I'm still not willing to meet you at $9,500. I'm willing to pay $8,800 for the product, and I'll accept the premium support package as a value-add. Can you consider this offer?",8800.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I'm not willing to go as low as $8,800, Bob. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $9,200. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, considering the value of the product and the premium support package. I hope you'll consider this offer.",9200.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm still not willing to pay $9,200. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for the product, and I'll accept the premium support package. This is my final offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",8500.0,Bob,10,
