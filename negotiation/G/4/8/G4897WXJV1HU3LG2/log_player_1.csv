Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you an exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,500,000. I believe this reflects its true worth and the significant benefits it offers."",
""product_price"": 1500000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High Starting Point:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,000,000, you can afford to start high with Bob. This leaves room for negotiation and maximizes potential profit. 
* **Justification:**  While the price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value, the message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant benefits,"" aiming to create a perception of higher value.
* **Potential for Negotiation:** This initial offer allows room for Bob to negotiate down. If Bob counters, you can gauge his interest level and adjust accordingly, never going below your $1,000,000 safety net."
