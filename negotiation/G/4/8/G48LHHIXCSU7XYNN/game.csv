,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $9,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000.  It's still a great price for a product worth much more.  Let's see if we can find a middle ground.",11000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to come down to $11,000, but I'm still a bit above that. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,800?",9800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I'm still not quite there at $9,800. How about we split the difference and go with $10,400? It's a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close this deal. Let me know what you think.",10400.0,Alice,5,
