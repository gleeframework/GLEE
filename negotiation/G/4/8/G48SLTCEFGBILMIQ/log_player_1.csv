Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I see the value in the product, $1,100,000 is above my budget.  I'm willing to offer $850,000.  This is a fair price that reflects the value I see in the product and allows me to make a reasonable profit.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $850,000.

This feels like a fair compromise that considers both our positions. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1050000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,050,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to offer $900,000, which is a significant increase from my last offer and a fair price considering the potential of the product. Let's find a middle ground and make this deal happen.

{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and find a solution.  However, I need to be upfront â€“  $950,000 is cutting it too close to my bottom line.

Round 8
Bob's offer:

This is a significant increase from my last offer, and I believe it's a fair price for both of us.  Let's close this deal and move forward. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000.

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is highly unlikely to move significantly from his $925,000 offer.  He's consistently been incrementally increasing his bids, indicating a firm ceiling.  Continuing the negotiation risks a lower final offer or a stalemate.  Taking the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John is the most logical choice to maximize profit at this point."
