"I appreciate your offer, Alice. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to me. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to stay within my budget. What do you think?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $900,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000 to make this deal work. This price still leaves you with a significant profit potential and allows me to reach a more reasonable price.  Let's see if we can find common ground.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, $1,050,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $975,000. I think this is a fair compromise that benefits both of us. What do you think?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  However, $975,000 is still a bit too low for me.  Let's aim for a mutually beneficial outcome.  I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000.  This price is a fair compromise, considering the value of the product and your budget.  Let's try to close this deal.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I understand your concerns, Alice, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $1,025,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer, and that's $990,000. I think this is the best compromise we can reach, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product at this price. What do you think?",990000.0,Bob,6,
