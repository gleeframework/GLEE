# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $12000. This is a great deal, considering the market value is $15000 to you. Let me know if you're interested! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","I'm not sure I agree with Alice that the market value is $15,000 to me. I think it's worth $8,000 to her, so I'm not sure I'm getting a great deal. I'd like to reject the offer.
