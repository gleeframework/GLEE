Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. Considering the product's worth is only $1,500,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the actual value of the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth is only $1,500,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.

Explanation: While Bob is getting closer to a reasonable offer, it's clear he's anchored to his valuation of $800,000 and is unlikely to meet the minimum price I need. John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, which is a better outcome than continuing negotiations with Bob at this point."
