"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing a starting price of $2,000,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of its worth.",2000000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your offer, but I'm not willing to pay $2,000,000. Considering the product's worth is only $1,500,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the actual value of the product.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your perspective on the price, but I believe $1,200,000 significantly undervalues the product's potential. I'm willing to negotiate, however.  How about we meet halfway and settle at $1,600,000?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, Alice. However, I'm still not comfortable with the price. Considering the product's worth is only $1,500,000 to you, I'd like to make a counteroffer of $1,400,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway from my original offer, but I need to stay within my budget.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
