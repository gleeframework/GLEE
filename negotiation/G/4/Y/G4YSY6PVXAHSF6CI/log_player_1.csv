Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 1500000}
```

I'm starting with a price that is higher than my minimum value. This is a good starting point to see if Bob is interested in a deal. If he rejects this, I can adjust my price based on his counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,400,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,400,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

Bob's offer is above my minimum value and it's a good starting point for negotiations. Accepting his offer guarantees me a profit and avoids the risk of further negotiations."
