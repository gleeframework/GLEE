"Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a chance to purchase this truly unique product. Given its value and potential, I'm proposing an initial offer of $2,000,000. I'm confident it will exceed your expectations.",2000000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me. This is a fair price that reflects both of our interests. Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and presenting yours. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,200,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,750,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1750000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement if we continue to work together.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is enticing, I need to be upfront - I have a standing offer for $1,500,000 from another interested buyer. To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a compelling reason to forgo this other offer.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,475,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value we both place on this unique product.",1475000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand your situation and appreciate your transparency.  While $1,475,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This would be a significant benefit for you, allowing you to close the deal quickly and avoid potential delays with the other buyer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied.",1450000.0,Bob,6,
