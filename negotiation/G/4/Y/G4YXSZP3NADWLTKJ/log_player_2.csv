{""message"": ""Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $2,000,000 is significantly higher than my budget. I'm willing to pay $1,200,000 for the product, given its value to me.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you taking the time to consider my offer and presenting yours. While I understand your perspective on the product's value, $1,200,000 falls short of what I had in mind.  I'm willing to meet you halfway and lower my price to $1,750,000. This represents a significant concession on my end, reflecting my desire to find a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,750,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $1,750,000 is still beyond my budget.  I'm prepared to offer $1,400,000.  This represents a substantial compromise on my end, and I believe it's a fair price that reflects the value we both place on the product. I'm confident we can reach a mutually agreeable agreement if we continue to work together."", ""product_price"": 1400000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate and your understanding of the product's value. While your offer is enticing, I need to be upfront - I have a standing offer for $1,500,000 from another interested buyer. To be completely transparent, I'd prefer to do business with you, but I need a compelling reason to forgo this other offer.  Would you be willing to consider a price of $1,475,000?  This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the value we both place on this unique product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,475,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,475,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While Alice's offer is closer to Bob's budget, it's still above his ideal price. Bob can still try to negotiate further, particularly given Alice's stated preference for selling to Bob. There's room for another counteroffer before considering buying from John."

Round 6
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your situation and appreciate your transparency.  While $1,475,000 is closer to my budget, I'm still aiming for a slightly lower price. I'm prepared to offer $1,450,000.  This would be a significant benefit for you, allowing you to close the deal quickly and avoid potential delays with the other buyer. I believe this is a fair compromise that allows us both to walk away satisfied."", ""product_price"": 1450000}
