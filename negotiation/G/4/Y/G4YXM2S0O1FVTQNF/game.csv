"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to work with you.  However, $7,500 is a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference and I come down to $8,250? It's a fair price considering the value of the product.",8250.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm still trying to find a price that works for both of us. $7,800 is closer, but I'm still a bit away from my target. Let's meet in the middle. I'm willing to lower my price to $8,000. This is a fair offer given the product's value, and I'm confident you'll be happy with it.",8000.0,Alice,5,
