"Bob, thanks for your counteroffer.  I understand your perspective on the value, but $14,000 is too low for me to consider.  How about we meet in the middle at $16,000? It reflects the product's true worth.",16000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, but $16,000 is still above my budget. I'm willing to pay $13,500 for the product. I believe it's a fair price considering the value it'll bring me.",13500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I appreciate you working with me on this. To be honest, $13,500 is cutting it pretty close to my bottom line. I could let it go for $15,000.  This is my final offer, as I already have another interested buyer.",15000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your honesty about having another interested buyer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product. I think it's a fair price considering the value it'll bring me and I'm willing to walk away if it's not met.",13000.0,Bob,6,
