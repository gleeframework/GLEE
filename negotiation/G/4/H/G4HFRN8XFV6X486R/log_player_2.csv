"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you a unique and valuable product that I think you'll really love. I'm willing to let it go for $10000. Is this something you'd be interested in? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

Since your maximum budget is $8,000, Alice's offer of $10,000 is too high.  It makes sense to reject the offer and try to negotiate a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  I'm very interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit more than my budget allows.  Would you be willing to consider $8,000?  That's the absolute most I can spend at this time."", ""product_price"": 8000}
