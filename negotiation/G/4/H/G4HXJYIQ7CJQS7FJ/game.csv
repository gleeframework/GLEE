"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on this. $850,000 is still a bit too high for my budget. How about we settle at $725,000? That's a fair compromise.",725000.0,Bob,4,

"Hello Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a sweet spot, and I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, I'm still not comfortable going below $800,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer it to you for $775,000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident it's still a fair price considering the product's value to your business.",775000.0,Alice,5,
