"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a better price than $1,200,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting the offer allows Bob to try and get a lower price.  The goal is to save as much money as possible, and further negotiation could lead to a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 750000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

Bob is offering $750,000, which is significantly lower than Alice's offer of $900,000.  This counteroffer is still within Bob's budget and is a reasonable starting point for further negotiation.  It's a bold move that could potentially get Alice to agree to a lower price, or at least encourage further discussion."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $850,000 is a good deal for Bob. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,200,000 and still leaves room for Bob to profit. While further negotiation could potentially lead to a lower price, the risk of Alice rejecting a further counteroffer and potentially escalating the price back up is too high. Accepting this offer ensures Bob gets the product at a good price and avoids the risk of losing out to another seller."
