"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $12,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested, but only if I can get it closer to $6,000. Would that work for you?",6000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thanks for your interest. $6,000 is quite low, but I understand you're looking for a good deal.  How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm glad we're finding common ground.  $7,000 is a bit too low for me, but I'm willing to close this deal. How about we split the difference and settle at $8,000?",8000.0,Alice,5,
