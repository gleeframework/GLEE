"Bob, I'm offering you my product for $950,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's significantly lower than what it's worth to you. Let me know what you think!",950000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm interested in the product, but $950,000 is a bit steep for me. I was thinking more along the lines of $850,000.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your offer, but I'm not quite there yet.  $850,000 is still a bit lower than I'm willing to go. How about we meet in the middle at $900,000? It's still a great deal for you, as you'll be paying significantly less than what the product is worth to you. Let me know what you think.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make sure I'm getting a good deal.",875000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to be flexible.  $875,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $890,000.  This is a fair compromise, and it still allows you to get a great deal. What do you say?",890000.0,Alice,5,

"I'm getting closer to your price, but I'm still a bit away. I'm willing to meet you at $885,000. This is my final offer, I'm not willing to go any lower than that.",885000.0,Bob,6,
