"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you a fantastic product that I believe will be incredibly valuable for you.  Given its potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $950,000. I believe this is a fair reflection of the value it offers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $950,000 is a good price, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can try to get a better deal by making a counteroffer.  There's a chance Alice might be willing to lower the price to get a deal done."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, thank you for the offer. I appreciate you recognizing the potential of this product.  However, $950,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. I'm willing to pay $850,000 for it. This price reflects the value I see in the product and allows for a healthy profit margin for you as well.  Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 850000}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer and understand your perspective.  While $850,000 is certainly a respectable figure,  the true value of this product, in terms of its potential and the benefits it offers, is significantly higher. I'm confident that you'll see a considerable return on this investment. I'm willing to come down slightly to $920,000.  I believe this price point represents a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this transaction. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $920,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's price has come down, it's still above Bob's desired price point. Bob can still try to negotiate a lower price. There's a chance Alice might be willing to budge further to secure the sale. If she rejects another counteroffer, Bob can always buy from John as a last resort."

{""message"": ""Alice, I understand your position, but $920,000 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $880,000, which is a significant increase from my previous offer.  This price allows for a good profit for you while still being within my budget. I'm hopeful we can come to an agreement at this price. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 880000}
