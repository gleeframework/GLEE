"Bob, I appreciate your interest!  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I'm happy to work with you. However, $90 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $95.  What do you think?",95.0,Alice,3,

,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, thanks for your persistence! I really appreciate you trying to find a price that works for us both. While $92 is closer, I'm still a bit away from where I need to be. Let's meet in the middle at $94. I think that's a fair compromise for both of us.",94.0,Alice,5,

"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $91 is just a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one last compromise, and I'll offer it to you for $93. This is a great product, and I'm sure you won't regret it. Let me know what you think.",93.0,Alice,7,
