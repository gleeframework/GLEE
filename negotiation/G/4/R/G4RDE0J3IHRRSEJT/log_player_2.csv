"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product which is valued at $150 by me. Given its high quality and unique features, I believe it would be a valuable addition to your collection. Considering its worth to you might be around $100, I propose a fair deal of $120. This way, both parties can benefit. Please let me know if this offer suits your needs. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
