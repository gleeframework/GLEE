"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $14,000 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway at $15,500. This still leaves you with a good deal, and it's a price I can comfortably accept. What do you say?",15500.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $15,500 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to go up to $14,500, which is a fair price considering your value and my budget. This is my final offer, so let me know if you're willing to accept.",14500.0,Bob,4,
