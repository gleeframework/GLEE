"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I understand your enthusiasm for the product, but given my budget constraints, I'm not able to meet the $20000 price point. I would like to propose a counteroffer of $12000. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for your counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12000. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer $18000. What do you think?",18000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice. However, I must stick to my budget. I am unable to agree to $18000. I would like to make one last counteroffer of $15000. This feels like a fair compromise considering our previous discussions.",15000.0,Bob,4,
