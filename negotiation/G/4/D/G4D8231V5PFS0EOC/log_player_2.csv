"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I've done my research and I think it's a great fit for you. I'm willing to offer it to you for $900000. This is a great deal, considering its value to you is $1200000. I'm confident you'll find it worth every penny. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. We know Alice is willing to sell for at least $800,000.  Rejecting the offer allows us to try and get a better price."

{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate the value this product brings, $900,000 is a bit steep for me right now.  I'm willing to pay $850,000.  This is a fair price considering your value and my budget.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement."", ""product_price"": 850000}

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $850000 is a bit of a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $950000. This is a fair compromise, considering the value it brings to you and the original price I had in mind. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer is still too high.  We know her minimum is $800,000, and we're willing to pay $850,000. There's still room for negotiation, and rejecting this offer keeps the door open for a better price."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that you're sticking to your original offer of $850000, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product at that price. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $920000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $920,000.

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $920,000. This is still a good deal for us, as we're willing to pay up to $1,200,000 for the product. Accepting this offer saves us $280,000 compared to buying from John.  While we could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice walking away or us needing to buy from John makes accepting this offer the best choice."
