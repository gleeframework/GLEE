Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 120}
```

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a reasonable starting point, as it's a bit higher than what the product is worth to Bob, but it still leaves room for negotiation. I'm hoping Bob will be willing to pay a bit more than his minimum, but if he doesn't, I can always counter or sell to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While I'd like to get $100, Bob's offer is too low, as it's below my minimum.  I will reject his offer and counter with a new offer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm going to counter with $105. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counteroffer.  It's still above my minimum, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $100 is my minimum acceptable price, and I'm happy to accept it rather than risk losing him completely.  There's no guarantee I can do better in the next round, and selling to John would get me the same amount anyway."
