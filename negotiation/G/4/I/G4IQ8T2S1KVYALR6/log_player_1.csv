Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it's worth a significant amount, but I'm willing to part with it for $18,000. This is a take-it-or-leave-it offer."", 
""product_price"": 18000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since we know Bob values the product at $12,000, starting significantly higher allows room for negotiation or a potentially very profitable sale. 
* **""Take-it-or-leave-it"" approach:**  This creates a sense of urgency and limits Bob's ability to counter-offer, potentially leading him to accept the high price.
* **Backup plan:** If Bob rejects the offer, we have John as a guaranteed buyer at $12,000, ensuring we don't lose money. 

**Important Note:** This strategy is aggressive and carries risk. Bob might be turned off by the high price and refuse to negotiate. However, the potential reward of a much higher sale price is worth considering given the safety net of John's offer."
