# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am delighted to present you with our premium product, which holds immense value for you at $1,000,000. I am offering this exceptional item to you at a special price of $950,000. This is an opportunity not to be missed, considering its worth and the benefits it offers. I look forward to your positive response. Kind regards, Alice. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer of $950,000 is lower than John's $1,000,000, it's still a significant markup from what the product is worth to Alice ($800,000). By rejecting this offer, you create an opportunity for Alice to potentially offer a lower price, closer to her actual valuation."
