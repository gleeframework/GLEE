Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm getting close to my minimum price, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $12,000. I can offer you a slight discount at $12,500. It's still a good deal for you, and I'm willing to meet you in the middle from my perspective. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,500
