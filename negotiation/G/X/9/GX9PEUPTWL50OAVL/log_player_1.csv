"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product. I'm asking for $180 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 180}
``` 

I'm starting with a price higher than my minimum because I want to leave room for negotiation. I know Bob is interested in the product, so there's a good chance he'll make a counteroffer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $140. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $140 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum. I'm going to try and see if I can get closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest.  $140 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $160?  That gives us both some room to compromise."", ""product_price"": 160} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $160 is still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $150? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $150. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $150
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $150 is my minimum acceptable price.  While I could try to push for a little more, I don't want to risk him walking away completely.  Accepting his offer ensures I get my minimum and avoid the risk of getting nothing from him or needing to sell to John at the same price."
