"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the opportunity to purchase this incredible product with you. I believe it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. As we've discussed, the market value of this product is $1,500,000. I'm willing to make a generous offer to you, and I'm proposing a price of $1,400,000. This is a significant discount from the market value, and I believe it's a fair and reasonable price considering the value this product will bring to your business. What do you think?
