"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $1,050,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $1,100,000 to make this deal work.  It's still a great price considering the product's value to you. Let's meet in the middle.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I can only go up to $1,075,000. I really like the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",1075000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand your budget concerns, but $1,075,000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to make one final compromise and offer the product for $1,090,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product to you. If you're serious about getting this, I believe we can reach an agreement.",1090000.0,Alice,5,
