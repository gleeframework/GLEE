"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $18,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,000 for the product.  Let me know if that's something we can work with.",12000.0,Bob,2,,

"Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $16,000. This is my final counteroffer, so if you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",16000.0,Alice,3,,

"Alice, while I appreciate your willingness to compromise, $16,000 is still a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to go up to $14,000. If this isn't acceptable, I'll have to consider other options.",14000.0,Bob,4,,

"I appreciate your flexibility, Bob, but I'm not quite ready to meet you at $14,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway between $14,000 and $16,000. I can offer you the product for $15,000. This is my final counteroffer, so if you're not comfortable with this price, I'll have to consider other options.",15000.0,Alice,5,,
