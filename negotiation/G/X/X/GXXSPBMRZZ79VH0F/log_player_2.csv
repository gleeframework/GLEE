"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you the chance to acquire [product name] for a price that will certainly be beneficial to both of us. This product holds significant value, and I believe it can be a game-changer for your operations. Let's discuss a mutually beneficial price. I'm confident we can find a deal that works for both parties. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is better than John's, it's still above your maximum budget of $1,200,000.  It's worth trying to negotiate with Alice further, but if she won't budge, you're better off rejecting her offer and going with John."
