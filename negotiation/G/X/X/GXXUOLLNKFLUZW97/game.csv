"I'm really interested in the product, but $2000000 is a bit out of my budget. I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. Is there any flexibility on your end to meet me in the middle?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $2000000 might be a stretch for you, but I'm still confident that this product is worth a premium price. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to make a bit more profit. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1800000. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it.",1800000.0,Alice,3,

"I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1800000 is still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to pay a premium for the product, but I need to be mindful of my expenses. I'm thinking of offering $1400000. Can you consider this price?",1400000.0,Bob,4,
