"I'm very interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1200000. I'm willing to make a serious offer, but I need to make sure it's a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",1200000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your enthusiasm and understand your perspective.  While $1200000 is a good starting point, I believe the true potential of this product warrants a bit more.  How about we split the difference and settle on $1350000? This would ensure a fair deal for both of us, and I'm confident you'll see the value in that.  Let's make this happen!",1350000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your perspective, but I still think $1350000 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I'd need to go a bit lower. How about $1250000?",1250000.0,Bob,4,
