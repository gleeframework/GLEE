Send your offer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you our premium product. It's worth $80 to you, and I believe it's also valuable to me at $95. Let's work together to find a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 95}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, thanks for the offer, but $95 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $80 for the product, which is fair for both of us. Let's see if we can make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}"
