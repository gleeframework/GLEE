,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $10,800 is a little too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit more, how about $11,200? This is a great deal for a product worth much more. Let's make this happen!",11200.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to negotiate.  However, $10,900 is still too low for me.  Let's split the difference. I'm willing to go down to $11,050.  This is a fair price for both of us. What do you say?",11050.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but I'm still a bit short on budget. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $10,800 again. Can you consider it?",10800.0,Bob,6,
