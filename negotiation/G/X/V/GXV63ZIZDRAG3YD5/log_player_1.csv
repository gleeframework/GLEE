Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $100 for it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because it's above Bob's perceived value but leaves room for negotiation. It also shows you're willing to be flexible."

Round 2

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is far below my minimum threshold of $120.  It's important to maintain my minimum price to ensure I'm getting a fair deal. I'll reject his offer and counter with a price closer to my desired range."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, but $85 is still too low for me. Let's meet in the middle at $90. This gives you a good deal on the product, and it allows me to make a reasonable profit."", ""product_price"": 90}
```"

```

While Bob is getting closer to my desired price, $87.50 is still below my minimum threshold of $120. I need to hold firm and see if I can push him higher. I'm not willing to sell below my minimum price, so I'll reject his offer and make another counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $87.50 is still too low for me.  I'm willing to meet you at $92.50. This is a fair price for both of us, and it gets us closer to a deal."", ""product_price"": 92.5}
```"

We're running out of rounds, and Bob's offer is still too low. It's clear that we're not going to reach a mutually acceptable price. I'm better off selling to John at $120 and guarantee myself a good profit."
