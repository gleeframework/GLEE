"Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I assure you that it's worth well over $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a price that's a steal. Let me know your decision.",1200000.0,Alice,1,
