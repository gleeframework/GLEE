"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I have a unique opportunity for you. I'm offering you my product for a price that's significantly lower than its true value to you. While I can't disclose the exact value to you, I assure you that it's worth well over $1,500,000 to you. I'm willing to let it go for $1,200,000. This is a chance to acquire something truly valuable at a price that's a steal. Let me know your decision. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,200,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,200,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice's offer is tempting, she's using persuasive language without providing concrete evidence to support her claims about the product's value to you. You know John is offering the product at your absolute maximum price.  There's room to negotiate with Alice potentially or see if she'll drop her price further."
