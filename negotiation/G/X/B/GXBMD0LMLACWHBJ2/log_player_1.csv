"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. That price is a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $10,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000

Round 3

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate you working with me, Alice. However, $19,000 is still too high for my budget.  Could you consider $12,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand you're making compromises, Alice. To be fair to us both, I can go up to $13,000. This is a strong offer, considering my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

It's time to cut bait with Bob. He's consistently shown a willingness to pay far below the product's value and is unlikely to meet the $15,000 threshold. John offers a guaranteed $15,000, ensuring no further negotiation or risk of a lower offer from Bob in later rounds."
