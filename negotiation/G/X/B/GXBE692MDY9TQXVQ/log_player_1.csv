Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm for the product. While I see its value, $900,000 is a bit higher than my budget allows. I'm willing to offer $850,000. This price would be a fair compromise and allows us both to benefit from this deal. Let me know what you think.
