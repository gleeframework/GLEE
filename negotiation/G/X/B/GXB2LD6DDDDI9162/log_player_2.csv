"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Dear Bob, I am excited to present our premium product, which holds immense value and can significantly enhance your business operations. Given its worth to you, I believe it's an excellent opportunity for mutual benefit. I am offering this product to you for $10,000, which I believe strikes a fair balance between the value it provides and the cost. Please let me know if you're interested in discussing further details or proceeding with the purchase. Looking forward to your positive response. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

While Alice's offer of $10,000 is tempting, you can save more money by rejecting it. You know John will sell it to you for $12,000, but there's a chance Alice might lower her price to avoid losing the sale."
