"I'm excited to offer you this incredible product, and I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. I'm willing to start with a price of $1,000,000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1000000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice.  I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While I'm interested, I'm looking to pay closer to $800,000 for this product.  It's a significant investment for me, and this price point would allow us both to make a good deal.  What do you think?",800000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $800,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $950,000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you, and I think it's a good compromise. What do you think?",950000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $950,000 is still a bit out of my budget.  I'm confident we can find a solution that works for both of us. How about $900,000?  This would be a fair price for the value I see in the product, and would make the deal more attractive for me. Let's find a way to make this happen.",900000.0,Bob,4,

"I can see that you're really interested in this product, and I appreciate your persistence. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I get a good price for it. I can offer it to you for $925,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for you. What do you think?",925000.0,Alice,5,
