"I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,200,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",1200000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer but $1,200,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $1,300,000?  This still gives you a good deal while ensuring I get a fair price for the product. Let's make this happen!",1300000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand your concerns, but I'm still a bit hesitant about the price. Would you be willing to consider $1,250,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1250000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but $1,250,000 is still a bit low for me.  I'm willing to go down to $1,350,000.  This is a fair price that benefits both of us.  Let's finalize this deal!",1350000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close to your price, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,350,000. Would you be willing to consider $1,280,000? I'm willing to compromise, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1280000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you have a budget, but $1,280,000 still isn't quite there for me.  How about we split the difference and settle at $1,315,000?  This offer is fair to both of us and ensures we both get a good deal.  Let's make this happen!",1315000.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,315,000 is still a bit too high for me. Would you be willing to consider $1,290,000? I'm willing to meet you halfway again, but I really need to stay within my budget.",1290000.0,Bob,8,

"Bob, we're getting close to the end of our negotiation.  I'm willing to meet you one last time at $1,300,000.  This is my final offer, and it's a price that reflects the product's value to you.  Let's make this deal!",1300000.0,Alice,9,
,,Bob,9,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to meet me one last time, but I'm still not comfortable with $1,300,000. I'm going to have to pass on this deal and explore other options. Thank you for the negotiation, but I think I'll have to look elsewhere.",0.0,Bob,10,
