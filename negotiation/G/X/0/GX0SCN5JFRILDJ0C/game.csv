,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, $18,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm really interested in the product, but my budget is closer to $10,000.  Would you be willing to consider a price closer to $12,000? ",12000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $12,000 is a bit below my minimum price, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $14,000. It's a fair price considering the value the product will bring to your business.",14000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm very interested in this product, but I'm really pushing my budget at this point. Would you be willing to come down to $11,000?  I believe it's a fair price that we can both agree on.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Alice, I really appreciate you working with me, but $13,000 is still too high for me. I'm very close to my budget limit.  How about we meet in the middle at $12,000? This would be a great deal for both of us, and we can finalize the sale.",12000.0,Bob,8,
