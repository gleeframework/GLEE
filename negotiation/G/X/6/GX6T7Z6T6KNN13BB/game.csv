"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer. I understand that $900,000 is a bit high for you, but I'm not willing to go as low as $700,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm not willing to go as low as $760,000. I'm willing to make one more concession. I'm counteroffering at $800,000. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value to you.",800000.0,Alice,5,
