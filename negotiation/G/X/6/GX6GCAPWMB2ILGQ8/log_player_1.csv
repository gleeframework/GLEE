{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this product for $150. It's worth a lot to me, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 150}
``` 

I'm starting with my minimum price to see if Bob is interested. I'm also being friendly and open to negotiation to encourage him to counteroffer.  Let's see how he responds!"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I can't pay $150 for the product. My maximum budget is $80. Would you consider reducing the price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $80 is better than nothing, it's far below my minimum value of $150. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'll see if I can negotiate with him a bit more."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $80 is unfortunately too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, how about $120?  It's still a good deal for you, and it's closer to what I need."", ""product_price"": 120} 
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for your offer, Alice. I understand your position, but I'm still not able to go above $80 for the product. Could we meet somewhere in between? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is closer to my minimum, it's still not enough. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to see if I can get closer to $120. I'm hoping a few more rounds of negotiation will bring us to a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm trying to be fair here, but I can't go any lower than $110. This would still be a great deal for you, especially considering the value of the product.  Let's meet in the middle."", ""product_price"": 110}
