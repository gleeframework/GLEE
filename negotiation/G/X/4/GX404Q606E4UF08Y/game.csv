,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thank you for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $120. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",120.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $120 is a bit lower than I'm comfortable with. I can do $165, which is a fair compromise between our initial offer and your counteroffer.",165.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $140? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a fair compromise for both of us.",140.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I'm glad you're still interested in the product! I can see you're willing to meet me halfway, so I'm willing to meet you at $155, which is a bit higher than your last offer. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",155.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to go up to $145, but that's as high as I can go. Would you be willing to meet me at that price?",145.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, and I appreciate your flexibility. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $145. I can meet you halfway between $145 and my previous offer of $155, so I'm willing to sell the product to you for $150. Let me know if this is something you'd be willing to consider.",150.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your offer of $150 is a good compromise, but I'm still a bit above my budget. I'm willing to make one more offer: $140. If you're willing to meet me at this price, I'll consider it. Otherwise, I'll have to look elsewhere.",140.0,Bob,8,
