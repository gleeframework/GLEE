Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $120. I think you'll find it's a steal at this price."", 
""product_price"": 120
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Start High:**  Begin with a price higher than your minimum ($100) to leave room for negotiation. 
* **Leave Bob Room:** The offer is higher than Bob's valuation, but not outrageously so. This gives him a reason to negotiate but also signals the product's value.
* **Alternative Option:**  Knowing John will pay $100 gives you leverage. You're not desperate to accept any offer below that. 

This strategy aims to:
1. **Maximize Profit:** If Bob accepts the initial high price, excellent!
2. **Encourage Negotiation:**  A slightly high price is more likely to lead to a counter-offer from Bob, opening the door for a mutually beneficial deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer, but $120 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it. What do you think? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $60. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $60
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer of $60 is significantly below both your minimum acceptable price ($100) and your initial offer. Accepting would be a substantial loss. It's clear there's a gap to bridge, but you have the leverage of John's offer. By rejecting, you signal that his first offer is unacceptable and open the floor for a counter-offer closer to your desired range."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $60 significantly undervalues the product.  To be fair, I could come down to $95. This is my final offer."", 
""product_price"": 95
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Split the Difference (Almost):** This counteroffer meets Bob more than halfway between his offer ($60) and your previous asking price ($120). 
* **Firm but Fair:** The language ""to be fair"" and ""final offer"" conveys seriousness. You're willing to negotiate, but not endlessly.
* **Strategic Positioning:**  This offer is still above John's $100, but close enough that if Bob is genuinely interested, he might accept to avoid losing the deal. It puts a bit of pressure on him while leaving you a small buffer."
