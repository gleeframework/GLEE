Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

**Explanation:**

* I'm offering the product to Bob for $14,000. 
* This price is higher than Bob's perceived value of $10,000 but lower than my minimum acceptable price of $15,000. 
* This strategy maximizes my chances of selling to Bob, while still getting a decent price.  If he rejects, I have the fallback option of selling to John for my minimum acceptable price."
