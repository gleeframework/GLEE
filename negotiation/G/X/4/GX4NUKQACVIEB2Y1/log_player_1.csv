Round 2
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's better than selling to John, I can likely get more if I keep negotiating."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $10,500 is a bit too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $11,000. This still leaves room for both of us to be satisfied. Let's close this deal!"", ""product_price"": 11000}

Round 4
Bob's offer:

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's getting closer, I'm still confident I can get a better price. I'm going to try one more counteroffer before considering selling to John."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm still not comfortable going any lower than $10,900. This price is fair considering the value you'll get from the product. Let's make a deal and move forward!"", ""product_price"": 10900}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your concerns, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. Would you be willing to meet me at $10500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

It's time to cut my losses. Bob seems unwilling to go higher, and my counteroffers haven't swayed him. At this point, selling to John for $10,000 is the best option to guarantee a sale and minimize the potential for further negotiation that could result in an even lower price."
