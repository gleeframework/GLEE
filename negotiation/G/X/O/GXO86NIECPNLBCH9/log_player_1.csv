Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering a product that I believe you'll find valuable. Given its worth, I'm proposing a price of $20,000. Let me know your thoughts!"", 
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** It's always good to start negotiations with a higher price than your minimum. This provides room for negotiation and potentially allows you to secure a higher profit.
* **Gauging Interest:**  Bob's response to this initial offer will give you valuable insight into his level of interest and price sensitivity. If he accepts outright, you've maximized your profit. If he negotiates, you can work towards a mutually agreeable price.
* **Backup Option:** You have a guaranteed buyer in John at $15,000. This knowledge gives you leverage in the negotiation with Bob. You are not desperate to sell below your minimum."
