"Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is within your budget, you can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. Alice values the product at $80, so there's room for negotiation. You can offer a lower price and see if Alice is willing to accept."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering $100, which is significantly lower than Alice's initial offer of $120 but still above her valuation of $80. This gives Alice some room to negotiate while still allowing me to save a substantial amount compared to John's price of $150."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $130. 
You have three options:

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's counteroffer of $130 is still within my budget and a better deal than buying from John for $150. While I could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject my offer again, and I might end up having to buy from John at a higher price. Accepting Alice's offer ensures I get the product at a price I'm comfortable with."
