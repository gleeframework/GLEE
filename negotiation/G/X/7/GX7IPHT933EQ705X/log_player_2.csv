"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I think it's a fantastic opportunity for you to get your hands on this amazing product. As we're just starting the negotiation, I'm willing to offer you a competitive price of $9,000 for the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's starting offer is too high. We have plenty of room to negotiate a better price before approaching John's $10,000 alternative."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but $9,000 is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay $7,000. Let me know what you think."",
""product_price"": 7000
}
```

**Reasoning:**  We start with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's offer but still leaves room for negotiation. This approach aims to:

* **Gauge Alice's flexibility:** A strong counteroffer helps us understand how much Alice is willing to move on price. 
* **Establish a lower target:** Even if Alice rejects this offer, it sets a lower point from which future negotiations will likely proceed.
* **Avoid getting too close to John's price:**  We need to leave room to increase our offer if necessary without exceeding John's $10,000 price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, thanks for your offer. I understand that $7,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you a price of $8,200 for the product. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,200
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is coming down, which is good, but $8,200 is still closer to her value than ours.  We've got a decent buffer before hitting John's price, so it's worth one more counteroffer to try and get closer to $8,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate the compromise. However, $8,200 is still a bit more than I had in mind. Could you meet me halfway at $7,600? That would be a fair deal for both of us."",
""product_price"": 7600
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Meeting Halfway:** This counteroffer positions the negotiation as finding a middle ground, which can be a persuasive tactic.
* **Testing Alice's ""One-Time Offer"":**  Alice's previous statement might have been a bluff. By continuing to negotiate reasonably, we can see how firm that price really is.
* **Leaving Room to Maneuver:** While closer to our limit, this offer leaves a small window to increase slightly if needed without going over John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're trying to find a middle ground, and I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway. However, I'm not comfortable going any lower than $8,500. This is the lowest price I can offer, and I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While we could likely squeeze out a few hundred dollars more by continuing to negotiate, Alice seems firm on her price, and we're running the risk of her walking away. Accepting $8,500 secures a significant saving compared to John's $10,000 price. It's a good balance between pushing for the best deal and avoiding the risk of losing out entirely."
