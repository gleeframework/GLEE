"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,700,000. It's a valuable asset, and I believe this price reflects its worth. I'm confident you'll find it to be a worthwhile investment. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,700,000.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.
