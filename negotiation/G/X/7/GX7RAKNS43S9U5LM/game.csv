"Alice, while I appreciate your offer, $1,700,000 is a bit steep for me.  I'm willing to pay $1,400,000 for the product, which is a fair price considering its value.  Let's see if we can reach a deal.",1400000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand your position, but $1,400,000 is simply not enough for me. I'm willing to come down to $1,600,000, which still allows me to make a reasonable profit. This is my best offer, and I hope you'll consider it.",1600000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $1,600,000 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm confident that we can find a price that works for both of us.  I'm willing to pay $1,500,000, which is a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's see if we can come to an agreement.",1500000.0,Bob,4,
