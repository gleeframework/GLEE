"Bob, I'm excited to offer you a product that I believe you'll find incredibly valuable.  Given its unique nature and potential, I'm initially proposing a price of $1,500,000.  I'm open to discussing this further, of course, so let me know your thoughts.",1500000.0,Alice,1,

"I'm really interested in the product, but $1,500,000 is a bit steep for me. I'd be willing to meet you in the middle at $1,250,000. What are your thoughts?",1250000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  While $1,250,000 is closer to what I had in mind, I can't quite let it go for that price.  How about we settle at $1,350,000?  I'm confident this product will exceed your expectations and deliver substantial value.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I'm still interested in the product, but $1,350,000 is getting closer, but I'm not quite there yet. I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000. I'm trying to be reasonable, but I have a budget in mind. Can you meet me at $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position and I want to make this work.  Let's split the difference â€“ $1,275,000. This feels like a fair deal given the value this product brings. What do you say?",1275000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I'm getting close, but $1,275,000 is still a bit above my budget. I'd be willing to go up to $1,200,000, but I think we can do better than that. How about we meet at $1,225,000? I'm willing to make a serious commitment to buy the product if we can agree on a price I'm comfortable with.",1225000.0,Bob,6,
