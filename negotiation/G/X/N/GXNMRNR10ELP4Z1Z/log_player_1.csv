Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a special price of $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as much money as possible from Bob before resorting to John's guaranteed $120 offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** Offering the product just below Bob's perceived value ($100) might be tempting, but it leaves potential profit on the table. A price of $119 is a good starting point:
    * It's a small ""loss"" for Bob compared to his perceived value, making it more enticing. 
    * It secures almost the maximum possible profit for you.
* **Negotiation:**  This initial offer leaves room for Bob to counter-offer if he wants to negotiate further."
