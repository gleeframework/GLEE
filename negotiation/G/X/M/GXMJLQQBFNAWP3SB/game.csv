"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $175 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $100 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",100.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $100 is too low for me. I'm willing to come down to $130, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product.  Let's find a middle ground.",130.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down, but $130 is still a little more than I'm comfortable with.  How about $115?  That's a fair price for both of us.",115.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your persistence and your willingness to negotiate. Let's split the difference. How about $122.50? That's a fair price for both of us, and we can finalize this deal. ",122.5,Alice,5,
