# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95.

(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

**Reasoning:**

Alice's initial offer is higher than your maximum budget of $100. It's also higher than the product's worth to her ($80). This means there's room for negotiation."
