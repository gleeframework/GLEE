{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,100,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it a valuable asset. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 1100000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's valuation:**  He values the product at $1,000,000, so he has room to negotiate upwards. 
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still significantly higher than your minimum price of $1,200,000, giving you room to negotiate downwards if needed.
* **It shows good faith:** It demonstrates that you're willing to negotiate and find a fair price. 

This strategy allows you to potentially get a higher price than John's offer while still leaving room for negotiation if Bob makes a counteroffer."

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum price of $1,200,000 and even lower than my initial offer of $1,100,000. While he seems interested, accepting his offer would be a significant loss for me. I will reject his offer and see if he's willing to negotiate closer to my valuation."

Bob's offer of $975,000 is still below my minimum price of $1,200,000. While he seems to be getting closer, I'm not willing to settle for such a low price. I'll reject his offer and try to get him closer to my desired price."
