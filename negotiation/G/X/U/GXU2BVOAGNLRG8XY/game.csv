"Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product, but $1,100,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $900,000?",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest. However, $900,000 is significantly below my minimum price. I'm willing to go down to $1,050,000, which is still a fair price considering the value of the product. Let me know if you're interested in this revised offer.",1050000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm on a tight budget. Could we meet in the middle at $975,000?",975000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $975,000 is still too far off from what I need. I'm willing to come down to $1,025,000. This is a fair price considering the value of the product, and I'm confident it will be a valuable investment for you.  Let me know if you're interested in this final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,
