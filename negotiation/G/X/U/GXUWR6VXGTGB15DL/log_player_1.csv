Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal for a product worth much more. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 12000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point because:

* **It's above Bob's perceived value:**  $12,000 is higher than the $10,000 Bob values the product at, giving him a reason to negotiate.
* **It's below your minimum:** It's still above your minimum of $15,000, so you're not losing money.
* **It leaves room for negotiation:**  This allows for a back-and-forth to potentially reach a mutually agreeable price.

Remember, I can always go to John for $15,000 if this negotiation fails."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate the offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I'm really interested in the product, but I have a limited budget. Can we meet in the middle at $9,500? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json

```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and counteroffer. While I appreciate his interest, $9,000 is far too low for me.  I need to make sure I get a price closer to my minimum. 

Let's see if we can find a middle ground."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $9,000 is simply too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? This would still be a good deal for you, and it's closer to the value I need to get for this product."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm still a bit above my budget at $10,500, but I'm willing to meet you halfway at $10,250. Can we agree on that price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,250

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to **reject Bob's offer** and make another counteroffer.  While $10,250 is closer to my desired price, it's still below what I need to make this worthwhile. I believe we can find a price that works for both of us."
