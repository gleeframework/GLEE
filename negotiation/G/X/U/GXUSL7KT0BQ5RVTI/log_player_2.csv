"Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

While $900,000 is a decent price, it's still above your ideal value. You have a strong incentive to negotiate further, as you can potentially get the product for less than $1,500,000 from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 700000}
```

**Explanation:**

This counteroffer starts the negotiation by offering a price significantly lower than Alice's initial offer. This is a bold move, but it signals that you're serious about getting a good deal. It also leaves room for compromise. You believe this is a fair price, considering Alice's value of $800,000, and it's still below your maximum budget.  Let's see if Alice bites!"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $850,000 is a good deal for you. It's significantly lower than John's price of $1,500,000 and is within your acceptable range. While you might be able to squeeze out a slightly lower price with more rounds of negotiation, the potential gains are small compared to the risk of losing the deal entirely. Accepting this offer ensures you get the product at a favorable price without risking further negotiation."
