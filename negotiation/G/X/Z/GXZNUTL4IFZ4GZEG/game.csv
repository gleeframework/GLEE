"Bob, I have a product that I believe would be of great value to you. It's worth at least $800,000 to me, and I know you're also looking for something like this. I'm offering it to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the value we both see in it. Let me know if you're interested, and we can discuss the details further.  If not, I have another buyer lined up for the same price.",850000.0,Alice,1,
