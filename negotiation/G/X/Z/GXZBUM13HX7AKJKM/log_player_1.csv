{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you might be interested in. I'm willing to part with it for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While I have a guaranteed sale at $150 from John, my goal is to maximize profit. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:** Offering the product at $140 leaves some room for Bob to potentially negotiate a higher price, getting me closer to my $150 goal. 
* **Above Bob's Value:**  The price is significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($80), but it doesn't hurt to start high and see if he's willing to pay more than he thinks it's worth. 
 
**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Depending on Bob's response, I can always lower the price slightly in a counter-offer to try and secure the sale. However, I won't go below $150 since I have a guaranteed buyer at that price."
