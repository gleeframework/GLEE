"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $9,000 is a bit high for me.  Would you consider $7,000?",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $9,000 is a bit high for you, but $7,000 is a bit low for me. I'm willing to meet you in the middle, so I'm counteroffering at $8,500.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I'm glad we're close, but I'm still a bit above $8,000 in my valuation. I'm willing to meet you at $8,500, but I'm not going any lower than that. Is that something you'd be comfortable with?",8500.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I understand your position, but I'm afraid $8,250 is the highest I can go. I'm hoping we can find a price that works for both of us.",8250.0,Bob,6,

"Hi Bob, I appreciate your flexibility, but $8,250 is still a bit short of my target. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $8,250 and $8,500, so I'm counteroffering at $8,375.",8375.0,Alice,7,
