"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you being willing to negotiate. I'm interested in the product but $9,500 is a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $8,500 for it. Let me know what you think.",8500.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the offer, Bob. I understand your perspective. However, the value this product brings to the table is significant, and I can't go as low as $8,500. Would you consider $9,000? It's a fair compromise.",9000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. I'm still very interested in the product, but $9,000 is still a bit too high for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,750?  This would be a fair deal for both of us, I think.",8750.0,Bob,4,
