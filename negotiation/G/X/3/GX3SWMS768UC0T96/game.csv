"Bob, I'm excited to offer you this product, which I believe holds great value for you. My asking price is $1,300,000. It's a competitive price considering its worth to you.  Let's see if we can find a mutually beneficial agreement.",1300000.0,Alice,1,

"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $1,150,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests.",1150000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but $1,150,000 is unfortunately below my minimum price.  Let's split the difference. How about $1,250,000?  I believe this is still a good deal for you, given the value of the product.  Let's see if we can finalize this deal.",1250000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Alice. While I understand your position, I must respectfully decline at $1,250,000. I am looking to keep the cost within $1,200,000. Would you be willing to lower the price further? I believe there's room for negotiation here.",1200000.0,Bob,4,
