Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to sell the product. However, given my budget constraints, I am unable to meet the $1,300,000 price point. Would you consider accepting a counteroffer of $1,150,000? I believe this is a fair compromise that respects both our interests. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000.
