"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to showcase this product to you. I believe it holds immense value, and I'm confident it can greatly benefit you. I'm initially offering it for $2,300,000."", 
""product_price"": 2300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

Starting with a high initial offer allows room for negotiation and potentially exceeding Bob's perceived value. This strategy aims to:

* **Anchor:** Set a high reference point that influences Bob's perception of the product's worth. 
* **Gather Information:** Observe Bob's reaction to gauge his interest level and potential budget.
* **Leave Room for Concessions:**  Strategic price reductions during the negotiation can appear as valuable concessions to Bob.

While John offers a guaranteed $1,500,000, the potential to secure a significantly higher price from Bob makes this negotiation worthwhile."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob's offer is a significant jump from his perceived value of $1,000,000, indicating strong interest. However, accepting $1,800,000 would leave a considerable amount of potential profit on the table.  It's worthwhile to continue negotiating."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your interest and counteroffer.  While I recognize you're making a serious offer, the value this product brings is truly unique. I could consider coming down to $2,100,000. I believe this price point reflects its true worth."", 
""product_price"": 2100000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Concession:** Decreasing the offer by $200,000 demonstrates willingness to negotiate while still aiming for a high price.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""unique value"" reinforces the product's worth and provides a reason for the higher price.
* **Leaving Room:**  The new price allows for further negotiation in subsequent rounds.

It's still too early to settle for John's offer. There's potential for a much better deal with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand the value of the product, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,900,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

The negotiation is progressing as expected. Bob is steadily increasing his offer, indicating a strong desire for the product. We're still significantly above his perceived value and have room to negotiate further. While accepting $1,900,000 would be a good deal, there's still potential to secure a higher price in the coming rounds."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  To show you I'm serious about making this deal work, I'm willing to come down to $2,000,000. This is a significant concession and a very competitive price for a product of this caliber."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Strategic Round Number:**  Round 5 signals we're nearing the halfway point. Offering a more substantial concession encourages Bob to reciprocate.
* **Strong Justification:** Emphasize the significance of the price reduction and reiterate the product's high value.
* **Reaching a Compromise:**  This price point is a strong position, only $500,000 above John's guaranteed offer, and still leaves room for a final agreement above $1,900,000."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to offer $1,800,000 for it. Can you consider this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a critical point in the negotiation. Bob has regressed to his offer from Round 2, likely testing your resolve. Accepting now would be a significant loss compared to the progress made. It's time to:

* **Hold Firm:**  Demonstrate you're unwilling to settle for a price significantly lower than what you believe is fair.
* **Signal Alternatives:**  Subtly remind Bob that you have other options, including John's offer.

We are still above John's offer, but we need to carefully consider our next move as we enter the latter half of the negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for the best possible price, and I've been flexible in trying to make that happen. However, I need to be realistic about the value of what I'm offering. I'm willing to stand by my previous offer of $2,000,000, but I can't go any lower. This product is in high demand, and I'm confident in its worth."",
""product_price"": 2000000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Firm Stance:**  Repeating the $2,000,000 offer makes it clear this is your bottom line. 
* **Justification:**  Reiterating the product's value and demand reminds Bob of what's at stake.
* **Time Pressure:** With fewer rounds remaining, subtly introducing a sense of urgency may push Bob towards a decision. 

This counteroffer balances firmness with flexibility and sets the stage for a final agreement or a strategic exit to John's offer."
