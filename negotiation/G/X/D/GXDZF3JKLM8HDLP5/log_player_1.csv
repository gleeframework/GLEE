{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I'm selling this product that's really valuable to me. I'm offering it to you for $120. It's a great deal for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

This offer is a starting point. It's higher than my minimum price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob is willing to haggle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hey Alice, $120 is a good start, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $100?  It's still a fair price for you, and it works better for my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is tempting, I'm aiming for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price point."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer but I'm aiming for a bit more.  How about $110? That's still a great price for you, and it gets me closer to where I need to be. Let's find a solution that works for both of us!"", ""product_price"": 110}
