,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but $10,000 is simply too low for me.  I'm willing to come down a bit further, but I need to stay above $10,500 to make this worthwhile.  Let's meet in the middle at $10,750.  What do you say?",10750.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I understand this is your final offer, but $10,625 still doesn't work for me.  I'm willing to drop to $10,635 as a final compromise.  If we can't reach an agreement, I'll have to move on to another buyer.",10635.0,Alice,7,
