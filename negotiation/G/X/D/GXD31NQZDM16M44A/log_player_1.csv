"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1000000}
```

I'm starting high, at $1,000,000.  This is a strong opening position that gives me room to negotiate. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming for the highest potential profit."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $800,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $800,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $800,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I believe there's still room for negotiation. Bob's initial counter-offer is my floor, but I can try to push for a higher price. I'll reject his offer and see if I can get him to budge."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 900000}
```

I'm going to counter with $900,000. This is a compromise between my initial offer and Bob's counter-offer. I'm hoping this shows a willingness to negotiate while still securing a profit higher than my minimum."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's tempting to take the $750,000, I'm still hopeful I can get closer to my desired price.  I'm not willing to accept anything below my minimum of $800,000, but I'll keep negotiating with Bob for now."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 850000}
```

I'm going to counter with $850,000. This is a middle ground between Bob's offer of $750,000 and my minimum of $800,000. I'm showing flexibility but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $725,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $725,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $800,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

Bob is clearly not willing to go higher than $725,000.  I've already gone down significantly from my initial offer, and there's no guarantee he'll budge further.  It's getting risky to keep negotiating.  I'm going to take the safe option and sell the product to John for $800,000.  While it's not my ideal price, it's my minimum acceptable amount, and it guarantees I get my desired value."
