"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this valuable product.  It's worth at least $800,000 to me, but I'm willing to let it go for a price that will benefit both of us.  I'm confident you'll find it extremely valuable, as it's worth over a million dollars to you.  I'm proposing a price of $950,000.  This allows for a significant gain for you, and a healthy profit for me. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is too high. While she's trying to create a sense of urgency and high value, you have a guaranteed option to buy the product from John for $1,000,000. By rejecting Alice's offer, you force her to potentially reconsider a lower price or you can proceed with your backup option, saving $50,000."
