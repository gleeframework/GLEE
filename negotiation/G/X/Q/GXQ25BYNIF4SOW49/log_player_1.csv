Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and the offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $1,000,000 from John, so you won't accept anything less.
* **Bob's Valuation:** Bob values the product at $1,200,000, meaning there's a potential $200,000 surplus you could negotiate for.
* **One-Shot Deal:**  Bob only has one chance to accept. This gives you some leverage.

**The Offer**

You want to maximize your profit while ensuring Bob accepts. Offering a price slightly below his maximum valuation increases the likelihood of a deal.

Here's a possible offer:

```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you this exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Considering its value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $1,150,000. This is a limited-time offer, as I have other interested buyers."", ""product_price"": 1150000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Message:**
    * Emphasizes the product's value and Bob's exclusive opportunity.
    * Creates a sense of urgency with the ""limited-time offer"" and ""other interested buyers"" statements.
* **Price:**
    * $1,150,000 leaves Bob with a $50,000 gain, making it attractive for him to accept.
    * Secures a $150,000 profit for you, significantly more than John's offer. 

**Important Note:** This is just one strategy. You could test different offers and messages to see what works best in your negotiation simulations."
