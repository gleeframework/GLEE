"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 18000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm starting with a high price of $18,000. This is a bold move, but it gives me a good starting point for negotiation. Since I don't know Bob's value for the product, I'm aiming high to maximize my potential profit. 

I'm also keeping in mind that I have the option to sell to John for $12,000, so I won't accept any offers lower than that."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

While Bob's offer is the minimum I'm willing to accept, I believe I can still get a better price. There are still 8 rounds left, and I can continue to negotiate with Bob."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
```

**Explanation:**

I'm lowering my price from $18,000 to $15,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate, but I'm still aiming for a price that's closer to my initial valuation. This counteroffer also leaves some room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob's offer of $13,000 is a significant improvement from his previous offer of $12,000, and it's only $1,000 less than my last counteroffer.  Given that there are only 6 rounds left, it's a good idea to take this offer and avoid the risk of further negotiations."
