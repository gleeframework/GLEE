I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  Although it's still lower than what I'd like, we're running out of time and I'm not sure if I can get a better deal in the next two rounds. This is a good compromise, and it's better than selling to John for $1,200,000 and having to deal with the potential hassle of finding another buyer in the future."
