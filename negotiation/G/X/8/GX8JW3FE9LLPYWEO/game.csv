"Alice, thanks for the offer, but $15,000 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with. I'm willing to pay $12,500 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering my budget and the value I place on it. What do you think?",12500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $12,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $13,750. This is a fair compromise, considering the value the product holds for you.",13750.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate, but $13,750 is still a bit higher than I can go.  I'm willing to pay $13,000 for the product.  This is a fair price, considering we're both trying to find a mutually beneficial agreement.  What do you say?",13000.0,Bob,4,
