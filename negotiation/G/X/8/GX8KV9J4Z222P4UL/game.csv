"Hi Bob, I understand that $175 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still willing to make a deal. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $125. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product at this price.",125.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're really interested in the product, and I'm willing to make one more compromise. I'm willing to go down to $120, but that's as low as I can go. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",120.0,Alice,5,
