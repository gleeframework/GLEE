"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer, but that price is a bit too high for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay around $60 for it.",60.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer, but I'm not willing to sell the product for $60. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $90. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",90.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway, but $90 is still a bit too steep for me.  How about we settle at $70? That's a fair price that works for both of us.",70.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $70 is a bit lower than what I was hoping for, but I'm willing to compromise further. I'll offer you the product for $85. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us.",85.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price, but I'm on a tight budget. I could do $75, but that's my absolute limit.",75.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $82. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.",82.0,Alice,7,
