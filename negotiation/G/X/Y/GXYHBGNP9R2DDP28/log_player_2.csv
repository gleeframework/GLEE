Round 7
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $75 is your limit, but I'm not willing to sell the product for that low of a price. I'll offer you a compromise: I'll sell the product to you for $82. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us.

At this point, Alice is very unlikely to go below $80. It's better to buy from John for $80 and avoid the risk of the price going up again or running out of rounds."
