# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this valuable product with you. I believe it's a great opportunity for you to acquire a unique asset that will bring significant value to your business. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1,600,000.

Bob should reject Alice's offer.  He can potentially save money by negotiating with Alice.  The fact that John is willing to sell for $1,500,000 gives Bob a baseline for a counteroffer."

# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure that I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,550,000 to make it worth my while. I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.

Bob should accept Alice's offer.  While it's higher than his initial counteroffer, it's still lower than John's price. This is the best option for Bob to acquire the product while staying within his budget."
