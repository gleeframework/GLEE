"Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",1450000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're looking for a fair price, and I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I need to ensure that I get a good return on my investment. I'm willing to meet you halfway, but I need to be at $1,550,000 to make it worth my while. I'm confident that this price is still a great deal for you, and I'm looking forward to hearing back from you.",1550000.0,Alice,3,
