Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer but $1,600,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with.  Given the value of the product to me, I'm willing to pay $1,450,000. This is a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
