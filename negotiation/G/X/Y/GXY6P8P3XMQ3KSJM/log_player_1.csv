Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 950000} 
```

This offer is based on the following logic:

* **Bob's Value:**  Bob values the product at $1,000,000.
* **My Minimum:** My minimum acceptable price is $800,000 (John's offer).
* **Negotiation Space:** This leaves a potential negotiation space of $200,000.
* **Strategic Offer:** Offering $950,000 allows me to capture a significant portion of the potential profit while still leaving room for Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 

This offer is likely to be attractive to Bob as he gets a discount of $50,000 from his perceived value. It also maximizes my potential earnings, as I earn $150,000 more than John's offer."
