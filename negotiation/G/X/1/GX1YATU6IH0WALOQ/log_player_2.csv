"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I'm willing to sell it to you for $13,000. This is a great price, considering the product's value to you is $15,000. I think we can come to a mutually beneficial agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer

Alice's offer is still quite close to my maximum budget. There's room for negotiation to get a better price."

While closer to my ideal price, I believe there's still room for negotiation with Alice before resorting to John's offer."

Alice is negotiating in smaller increments now, and this price is getting close enough to my goal to be worthwhile. It's not worth the risk of her backing out completely or the certainty of paying John a much higher price."
