Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly.  Given its value, I'm asking for $20,000.  What do you think?"",
""product_price"": 20000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:** Since we know Bob values the product at $15,000 and we have a guaranteed sale at that price to John, we can start with a higher offer. This gives us room for negotiation or to accept a potentially higher profit. 
* **Justification:**  The message vaguely justifies the price by mentioning ""value"" without being too specific. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The tone is friendly and suggests a willingness to discuss the price (""What do you think?""), leaving room for Bob to counter-offer.

**Strategy:**

This strategy aims to maximize potential profit. If Bob accepts the $20,000 offer, we get the best possible outcome. If he rejects it, we can always negotiate down or sell to John for our guaranteed $15,000."
