{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000.  It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

This offer is a good starting point for a few reasons:

* **It's higher than Bob's perceived value:** This gives Bob some room to negotiate.
* **It's significantly lower than your minimum:** This leaves you some room to negotiate down if needed, while still ensuring a profit.
* **It's a clear and concise message:** Bob knows exactly what's being offered. 

If Bob rejects this offer, I'll analyze his counteroffer and respond strategically. Remember, I have the option to sell to John for $12,000 at any time, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of your product. However, I am only willing to pay up to $9,500 for it. I hope this aligns better with your expectations.

I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While it's closer to my minimum, I can still potentially get a better price. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach an agreement closer to my desired price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but I'm aiming for a price closer to $10,000. How about we meet in the middle at $9,750? I think that's a fair price considering the value you'll get from the product."", ""product_price"": 9750}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand your position, Alice. I would like to counter with an offer of $9,600 for the product. This is the highest I can go while still staying within my budget. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,600. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,600

{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}

I'm going to accept Bob's offer.  While I'd prefer $9,750,  $9,600 is still a decent profit and closer to my minimum than selling to John for $12,000."
