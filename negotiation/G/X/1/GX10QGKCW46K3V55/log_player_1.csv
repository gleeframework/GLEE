{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I think you'll find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $200."",
""product_price"": 200
}
``` 

I am starting with a price higher than both my minimum and Bob's perceived value. This leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think $200 is a bit steep. I'd like to make a counteroffer of $120. Can you consider that? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is significantly below both my minimum price and his own perceived value. I'll try to negotiate a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""I appreciate the offer, Bob, but $120 is too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $170?"",
""product_price"": 170
}
```

I am aiming for a price closer to my initial offer while acknowledging Bob's counteroffer. This demonstrates flexibility while still aiming for a profitable outcome."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I understand that $120 was a bit low, but I'm still looking to save some money. How about we meet at $155? That's the highest I'm willing to go. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $155. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $155
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob is now offering a price higher than my minimum selling point. While I could try to push for a bit more, accepting this offer guarantees a profit and avoids the risk of losing the sale entirely."
