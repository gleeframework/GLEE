"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product.  $105 is a bit lower than what I'm hoping to get. How about we split the difference and go with $110?  It's still a great deal for you, and I'm sure you'll love the product!",110.0,Alice,3,

"I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $110. I'm willing to meet you halfway from $105, so how about $107.50? I'm really interested in the product, but I need to make sure it fits within my budget.",107.5,Bob,4,
