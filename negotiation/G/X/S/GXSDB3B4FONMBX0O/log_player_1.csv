Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase [product name] for $1,190,000. This is a unique product with immense value that you won't find elsewhere at this price."",
""product_price"": 1190000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Knowing your limits:** You have a guaranteed sale at $1,200,000 to John, so you shouldn't accept anything less from Bob.
* **Maximizing profit:** Aiming slightly below your guaranteed price ($1,190,000) significantly increases the chance of Bob accepting while securing nearly the maximum possible profit. 
* **Urgency and Value:** The message highlights the product's value and the uniqueness of the offer, encouraging Bob to make a decision quickly.

It's a balance between securing a sale and maximizing profit. While there's a slight risk Bob might reject the offer, the potential for a significantly higher return makes it a calculated risk worth taking."
