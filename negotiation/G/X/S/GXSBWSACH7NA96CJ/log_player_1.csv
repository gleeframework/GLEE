I'm starting with a price slightly higher than Bob's estimated value, hoping to maximize my profit. However, I'm open to negotiation if necessary, and I'm also aware of John's offer as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $7,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $7,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While Bob's offer is better than my minimum, it's still below my desired profit margin. I'll reject it and try to counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

I'm lowering my price slightly to $8,500, which is still above Bob's offer but closer to his estimated value. I believe this is a fair compromise that could lead to a successful deal."
