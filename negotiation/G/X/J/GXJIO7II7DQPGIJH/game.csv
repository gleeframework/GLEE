"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $10,000 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider $6,500?",6500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $6,500 is a little too low for me.  How about we meet in the middle at $8,500?  That would still be a great deal for you, and it's a price I can work with.  What do you think?",8500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I understand that $6,500 is quite a gap from your initial offer, Alice.  How about we try $7,500? I'm eager to find a price that works for both of us.",7500.0,Bob,4,
