"Round 1
Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  $10,000 is still too high for him, considering he values the product at $12,000.  He has room to negotiate and potentially get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 9000}
```

**Reasoning:**

Bob is trying to find a price that is acceptable to both him and Alice.  He's offering $9,000, which is a significant reduction from Alice's initial offer of $10,000.  This demonstrates that he's serious about buying the product but wants to get a good deal.  It also leaves room for further negotiation if necessary."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $9,500 is within Bob's budget and a significant improvement from her previous offer.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and ultimately having to buy from John for a higher price is too high.  Accepting this offer allows Bob to secure the product at a price he's comfortable with."
