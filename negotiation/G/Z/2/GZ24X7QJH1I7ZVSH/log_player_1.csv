Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product. I believe it holds significant value for someone with your insights and I wouldn't want you to miss out. I'm willing to part with it for $1,350,000."", 
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit, Minimize Risk:**  While I have a guaranteed buyer at $1,500,000, securing a deal with Bob at a slightly lower price carries less risk and still yields a significant profit.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The offered price of $1,350,000 is:
    * Significantly higher than Bob's perceived value ($1,000,000), giving me room for negotiation.
    * Still attractive enough that Bob might consider it a bargain compared to potentially missing out. 
* **Persuasive Messaging:** The message emphasizes the ""exclusive opportunity"" and Bob's unique position to benefit from the product, subtly encouraging him to accept the offer."
