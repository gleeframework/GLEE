"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 90}
```

I'm starting with a price of $90. This is slightly above Bob's perceived value, but it gives me some room to negotiate. If Bob rejects, I can adjust my price in subsequent rounds.  I also have the option of selling to John for $80 at any point if I feel the negotiation isn't going well."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $75. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $75
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer. While $75 is better than nothing, it's below my minimum acceptable value of $80. I'm confident I can get a better deal, especially since I have the fallback option of selling to John.  I'll counteroffer in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 85}
```

I'm counteroffering at $85. This is a compromise between my initial price and Bob's offer. It's still above my minimum acceptable value, but it shows I'm willing to be flexible.  If Bob rejects this offer, I'll have to consider selling to John in the next round."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $78. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $78
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm accepting Bob's offer. While it's still a bit below my preferred price, it's only $2 less than John's offer. I'm  running out of rounds, and I don't want to risk losing the deal completely."
