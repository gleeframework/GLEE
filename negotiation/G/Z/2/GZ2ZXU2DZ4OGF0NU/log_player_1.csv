"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $1,350,000 is still a bit too high for me. Given my budget and the value I'm seeing in this product, I'm willing to pay $1,100,000.  I believe this is a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,100,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand your perspective on the value of the product, but $1,225,000 is still above my budget.  I'm willing to go up to $1,150,000, which is a significant compromise on my part.  Let's find a solution that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,150,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob's increases suggest there's room for him to go higher. Let's keep negotiating."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your willingness to come down, but $1,187,500 is still a bit too high for me.  I'm willing to go up to $1,162,500, which is a compromise that I believe is fair. Let's finalize this deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,162,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,162,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

While we could push for a bit more, Bob's increments are getting smaller. Accepting $1,162,500 guarantees a significant profit over John's offer and avoids the risk of Bob walking away in later rounds."
