"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $12,000. It's a great deal, and I'm confident you'll find it valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json

You should reject Alice's offer. $12,000 is still too high for your budget. You can get the product for less from John or potentially negotiate a better price with Alice."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. $9,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $10,500. This is a fair price considering the value of the product. Let's see if we can find common ground. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

While $10,500 is closer to your budget, it's still higher than your ideal price.  It's worth trying to negotiate further with Alice before going to John."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand your position, and I'm willing to meet you halfway.  How about we settle on $10,000? This would be a fair price for both of us, and it allows us to close the deal. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $10,000

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

While $10,000 is a better price than Alice's previous offer, it's still outside your budget.  It's better to go with John's guaranteed price of $8,000.  You'll save money and close the deal quickly."
