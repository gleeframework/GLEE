"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,200,000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something worth a lot to you. Let me know your thoughts!"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price above the product's worth to Bob ($800,000) but still within the range of my minimum value ($1,000,000). This gives us room to negotiate.
* **Positive Tone:** I'm using a positive and persuasive tone to encourage Bob to consider the offer.
* **Highlighting Value:** I'm emphasizing the product's value to Bob, hoping to make the price seem more justifiable.

This first offer sets the stage for a negotiation that balances my desire for maximum profit with the need to keep Bob engaged in the process."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's Offer:** Bob's offer of $900,000 is still below my minimum value of $1,000,000.  
* **Strategic Rejection:**  While it's tempting to accept $900,000, I'm going to reject this offer. It's too early in the negotiation to settle for a price that's less than my minimum.
* **Maintaining Leverage:** By rejecting the offer, I maintain leverage in the negotiation. This allows me to potentially secure a better price in the following rounds.

I'm confident that I can negotiate a higher price or, if necessary, sell to John for $1,000,000."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $900,000 is still a bit too low for me. How about we split the difference? I'm willing to come down to $1,050,000. This is a significant compromise on my part, so I hope you'll consider it."", ""product_price"": 1050000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counter-Offer:** I'm offering a counter-offer that's closer to Bob's offer but still above my minimum value. 
* **Compromise Framing:** I'm framing my offer as a compromise to encourage Bob to feel like he's getting a good deal. 
* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reaffirming the value of the product to Bob, subtly reminding him that $1,050,000 is still a good price for him.

This counteroffer aims to find a middle ground while keeping the pressure on Bob to reach an agreement."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit short on budget. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000?

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $950,000

* **Emphasizing Value:** I'm reminding Bob of the product's value while also highlighting my concessions.
* **Urgency:** I'm using ""Let's see if we can reach an agreement"" to create a sense of urgency and encourage a final decision.
