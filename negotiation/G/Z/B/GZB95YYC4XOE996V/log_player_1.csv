Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to purchase the product before I list it publicly. Given its value, I'm proposing a price of $19,000. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 19000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $15,000, you should aim higher with Bob to maximize your potential profit. 
* **Reasonable Markup:** A price of $19,000 represents a significant markup from your minimum but is still within a potentially acceptable range if Bob values the product.
* **First-Mover Advantage:** By offering Bob the ""first look,"" you create a sense of exclusivity and urgency, potentially making him more inclined to accept a higher price.

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob if he counters. Remember, any price above $15,000 is a win for you in this scenario."
