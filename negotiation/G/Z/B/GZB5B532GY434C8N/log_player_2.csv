"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you. I believe it's a fantastic opportunity for you to acquire a unique and valuable asset. After careful consideration, I'm willing to offer you the product for $1,300,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,300,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,300,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* Alice's offer is $1,300,000, which is higher than her value of $1,200,000 but lower than your maximum of $1,500,000.
* However, you can get the product from John for $1,500,000, meaning you can save $200,000 by rejecting Alice's offer and buying from John."
