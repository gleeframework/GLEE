"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a game-changer, and I'm confident you'll love it. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $90
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

$90 is a good price, but I want to see if I can get it for even less. Since I have 10 rounds, I can afford to negotiate a bit."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  It's a good starting point, but I'm looking to spend a bit less. How about $75? I think that's a fair price for both of us."", ""product_price"": 75} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a significant discount from Alice's initial price, which shows I'm serious about buying the product.  This counteroffer is still within my budget and gives Alice some room to negotiate if she wants to close the deal.  I'm hoping this will get us closer to an agreement."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your concerns about the price, Bob. However, I'm still confident that this product is worth more than $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $82.50. This is a fair price considering the value it brings. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $82.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $82.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $82.50 is closer to my preferred price, but I still have room to negotiate.  I want to see if I can push her down a bit further. With 8 rounds left, I can continue the negotiation and try to get a better deal."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price. While I'm getting closer to my target, $82.50 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $80.  I'm confident we can reach an agreement at this price."", ""product_price"": 80} 
```

**Reasoning:**

I'm offering a price slightly lower than Alice's last offer, showing I'm still trying to get a good deal. However, the difference is small enough that it's likely Alice will be willing to accept.  With 7 rounds left, I have time to continue negotiating if necessary, but I'm hoping this will be the final offer."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand you're close to your target, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell it to you for $80. I'm willing to meet you at $81.50, which is my minimum price. This is a fair compromise considering the value of the product. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $81.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $81.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $81.50 is very close to my target price of $80. With 6 rounds remaining, it's not worth risking losing the deal for a small price difference. Accepting the offer allows me to get the product at a good price while still having time to explore other opportunities if needed."
