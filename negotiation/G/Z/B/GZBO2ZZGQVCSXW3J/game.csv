,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thank you for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your enthusiasm, but $110 is a bit out of my price range.  I'm willing to pay $95 for the product.  What do you think?",95.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $95 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise. I can offer you the product for $105. It's a great price, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",105.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. However, $105 is still a little too high for me. I'm really interested in the product, but I can only go up to $100. If that works for you, let's close the deal.  If not, I'm ready to explore other options.",100.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $100 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer you the product for $108. It's the lowest price I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a great deal for you.",108.0,Alice,5,
