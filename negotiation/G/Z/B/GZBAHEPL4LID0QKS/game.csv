"Alice, $1,800,000 is a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product but I can't go higher than $1,400,000. Let's see if we can find common ground.",1400000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1,400,000 is your maximum budget, but I was really hoping to get closer to the value I know this product holds. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm offering it to you for $1,600,000. What do you think?",1600000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $1,600,000 is still a bit out of my reach.  I'm firm on my previous offer of $1,400,000. This is my final offer, and I'm ready to walk away if it's not acceptable.",1400000.0,Bob,4,
