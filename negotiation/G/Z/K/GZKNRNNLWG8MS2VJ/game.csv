"Hi Bob, thanks for your offer of $140. I appreciate your interest in the product, but I'm still a bit above your budget. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a great compromise, and I think you'll really enjoy the product.",160.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $160 is still a little higher than I'm comfortable with. Let's split the difference - $150. This would be a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to finalize the deal.",150.0,Bob,4,
