"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I have a product that I think you'd be really interested in. It's worth $120 to you, and I'm willing to let it go for $100. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price of $100, which is a good starting point as it's a bit less than what Bob values the product at. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** This gives Bob some wiggle room to negotiate if he feels the price is too high. 
* **Building Rapport:**  The message is friendly and includes some information about the product's value to Bob, making it more likely he'll consider the offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I think it's a bit pricey at $100. I'm willing to pay $90 for it. Can you meet me halfway? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Goal:** My goal is to maximize profit.  Selling to John for $80 is my absolute minimum, and I can potentially get more from Bob. 
* **Counter-Offer Potential:**  Bob's offer of $90 is closer to my desired price, but I believe I can still get a bit more.  By rejecting his offer, I can send a counter-offer and potentially get closer to my goal of $100."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $90 is still a bit low for me.  How about we split the difference and go with $95? It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident you'll be happy with the product."", ""product_price"": 95}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a compromise by splitting the difference between my previous price and Bob's offer. This shows a willingness to negotiate and meet halfway.
* **Positive Framing:** I'm framing the price as a ""fair price for both of us,"" appealing to Bob's sense of fairness and making the offer more appealing. 
* **Confidence:**  The message expresses confidence in the product, subtly reinforcing its value."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $95. I'm willing to pay $92 for the product. Can you meet me at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $92. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $92
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Goal:**  Bob's offer of $92 is very close to my desired price of $95. 
* **Limited Rounds:**  We're already in round 4, meaning I have fewer rounds left to negotiate.
* **Risk of Lower Offer:**  There's a risk that if I reject this offer and counter with a higher price, Bob might become frustrated and either lower his offer further or walk away.  

While I'd love to get $95, the risk of losing the deal altogether makes accepting Bob's offer the more sensible choice."
