"Hello Alice, thanks for the offer.  I'm interested in the product but $950,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $950,000 is a bit steep for you. However, I'm still looking for a price that reflects the product's value to me. I'm willing to compromise and meet you halfway. I'll sell the product to you for $825,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",825000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you meeting me halfway. Your willingness to negotiate shows me you're serious about making a deal. How about we settle at $750,000?  It's a fair price that considers both our positions.",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand that $750,000 is a good compromise, but I'm still not willing to give up too much of the value of the product. I'm willing to meet you at $800,000, which is the minimum I'm willing to accept. This is still a good deal for you, considering the product's value to you is $1,000,000.",800000.0,Alice,5,
