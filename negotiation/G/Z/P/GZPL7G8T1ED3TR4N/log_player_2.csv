{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While $120 is a decent offer, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible. I'm going to counteroffer and see if I can get a better price before resorting to buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While $115 is closer to my budget, I still want to see if I can negotiate a lower price.  I'm going to counteroffer again.  If Alice won't budge, I'll consider buying from John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate you trying to meet me halfway, but $115 is still a bit out of my price range.  I'm sticking with my offer of $105. If you're willing to accept that, we can finalize the deal. Otherwise, I'll have to consider my other options."", ""product_price"": 105}
```"

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand your position, Bob. To reach a mutually beneficial agreement, I am willing to consider $110 as the final price for the product. I believe this is a fair compromise given the value it provides. Please let me know if this works for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $100","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has dropped her price to $110, which is getting closer to my budget. However,  I'm hesitant to go higher than $105. Given that I have John as a backup option at $100, it's a safer bet to go with him. I don't want to risk another round of negotiation and potentially end up paying more."
