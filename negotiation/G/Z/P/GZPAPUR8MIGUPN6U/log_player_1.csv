"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1700000}
```

I'm starting with a price that's slightly higher than the product's worth to Bob, hoping to maximize my profit. I'm confident that he'll find the value of the product compelling enough to negotiate."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While Bob's offer is close to my minimum, I'm not willing to settle for less than I believe the product is worth. I'm going to try to push for a better price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1600000} 
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the first offer, but I'm still holding firm on a price that reflects the product's value. I believe this counteroffer will be attractive enough for Bob to consider seriously."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4

(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is getting lower, but it's still not meeting my minimum. I'm going to keep negotiating with him, hoping to get a better price.  I'm not ready to settle for less than $1,500,000 yet."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1550000} 
```

I'm coming down to $1,550,000. I'm confident that this is still a fair price for the value of the product, and I hope Bob will see it that way.  This offer is still above my minimum, but I'm getting closer to what I need to accept.  If he doesn't take this offer, I may have to start considering selling to John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,450,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,450,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is still below my minimum. I'm running out of time, but I'm not going to settle for a price that undervalues the product. I'll try one more counteroffer to see if we can reach an agreement.  I'm getting nervous about the possibility of losing this deal altogether, but I'm going to hold out for the best possible outcome."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 1500000} 
```

This is my final offer.  I'm willing to accept my minimum price for the product.  I'm hoping that Bob will realize the value of this product and accept this offer. If he doesn't, I will have to consider selling to John, even though I'd rather see this deal go through with Bob."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,495,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,495,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is close to my minimum, and I'm running out of time.  I'm going to accept his offer, but I'm disappointed that I wasn't able to get my full asking price.  I'm glad that I was able to negotiate a price that is close to what I wanted, and I hope that this will be a positive business relationship with Bob going forward."
