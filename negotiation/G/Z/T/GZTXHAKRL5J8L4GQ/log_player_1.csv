{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd be very interested in. I'm asking for $15,000 for it, but I'm open to negotiation.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting High:**  I'm starting with a price that's higher than my minimum, giving me room to negotiate. 
* **Open to Negotiation:**  I'm signaling that I'm willing to work with Bob, which might encourage him to make a counteroffer.
* **Keeping John in Mind:**  While I'm trying to get the best price from Bob, I'm aware that I can always sell to John for $12,000. This serves as a safety net."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hello Alice, thank you for offering me the product. I'm interested, but my budget is limited. Can we negotiate the price down to $14000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Offer is Close:** While $14,000 is closer to my minimum, I can still try to push for a higher price.
* **Negotiation is Possible:** Bob is clearly interested in the product, and his counteroffer suggests he's willing to negotiate. 
* **Potential for Higher Price:** I believe I can get closer to my desired price of $15,000.

I'm going to counteroffer Bob to see if we can find a middle ground."

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer. I'm willing to come down a bit. How about $14,500?  This gives us both a good deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 14500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Compromise:** I'm showing flexibility by coming down from my initial price, but still aiming for a price closer to my desired value.
* **Middle Ground:**  $14,500 is a midpoint between my last offer and Bob's, which could increase the chances of acceptance.
* **Maintaining Leverage:**  I'm still holding onto a bit of leverage by not immediately accepting his offer."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for adjusting your offer, Alice. I appreciate your flexibility. I would like to propose $14200 as the price for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $14,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $14,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Close to Minimum:** Bob's offer of $14,200 is very close to my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. 
* **Risk of Losing Deal:** If I reject this offer, there's a chance that Bob might withdraw his interest completely, or I might need to further reduce my price to reach an agreement.
* **Time is Money:** Continuing to negotiate could drag out the process, and I'm aware that I could always sell to John for a guaranteed $12,000.

While I'd prefer a higher price, securing $14,200 is a good outcome considering the risk of losing the deal entirely."
