"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you my product for $1,000,000. It's a great deal for both of us, as it's well below its value to you. Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Bob should reject Alice's offer. While it's a good deal compared to buying from John, there's still room for negotiation. Bob can likely get a better price by making a counteroffer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your offer, but I'm looking to pay a bit less.  How about $900,000? It's still a good price for you, and a significant saving for me."", ""product_price"": 900000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to compromise.  $900,000 is a bit low for me, but I'm willing to come down to $950,000. This still leaves a significant profit margin for me, and it's a fair price considering the value of the product to you. Let's meet in the middle. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's counteroffer of $950,000 is a good deal for Bob.  While he could potentially negotiate further, the risk of Alice rejecting a lower offer and then potentially increasing her price again exists.  It's also worth noting that buying from John would cost Bob significantly more ($1,200,000). Accepting Alice's offer is the most sensible option to secure the product at a fair price."
