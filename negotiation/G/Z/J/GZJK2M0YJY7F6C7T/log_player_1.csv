Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product before I list it publicly. I think it would be perfect for you. I'm willing to let it go for $140."",
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  While you could offer it for $150, Bob likely won't bite. Aiming slightly lower increases the chance of a sale and a higher profit than selling to John.
* **Sense of Urgency:**  Mentioning ""listing it publicly"" creates a subtle sense of urgency, encouraging Bob to act quickly. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:**  Starting at $140 leaves a small window for Bob to negotiate (if he's so inclined) while still ensuring you're above your minimum."
