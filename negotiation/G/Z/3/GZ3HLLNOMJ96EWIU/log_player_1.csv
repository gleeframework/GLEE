Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $10,000. It's a great deal for both of us, and I think you'll be very happy with it. Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 10000}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Point:**  I'm aiming for a price closer to my value ($12,000) than Bob's ($8,000). $10,000 is a reasonable starting point that leaves room for negotiation.
* **Appeal to Value:**  My message emphasizes the value of the product and the benefits for Bob, making the offer more appealing. 
* **Flexibility:**  I'm open to negotiation, but I'm not giving away the farm. This leaves room for counteroffers without jeopardizing my profit margin. 
* **Plan B:** I'm aware that I can sell to John for $12,000, so I have a safety net if negotiations with Bob fail."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $9,000. I really like the product, but I'm on a tight budget. Can you meet me at $9,000? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **My Value:** The product is worth at least $12,000 to me. Accepting $9,000 would be a significant loss.
* **Negotiation Potential:** Bob is willing to negotiate, and I believe I can get closer to my desired price. 
* **Safety Net:** I have the option of selling to John for $12,000, so I'm not under pressure to accept a low offer. 

I'll make a counteroffer, aiming for a price closer to my value."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're on a budget, but $9,000 is a bit too low for me.  I'm willing to come down to $9,500 to make this work for both of us.  This price still gives you a good deal, and it allows me to get closer to my target.  Let's meet in the middle, what do you say?"", ""product_price"": 9500}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter-Offer Strategy:** I'm starting with a counter-offer that is closer to my target price ($12,000) than Bob's offer ($9,000). This shows him I'm willing to negotiate but not give away too much.
* **Empathy & Justification:**  My message acknowledges Bob's budget concerns, but also emphasizes the value I'm providing with the product and the fairness of my price.
* **Meeting in the Middle:** I propose a ""middle ground"" price that shows a willingness to compromise and creates a sense of potential agreement. 

This strategy aims to find a price that is both acceptable to Bob and beneficial for me."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to come down to $9,500, but I'm still a bit short on budget. Would you be willing to meet me at $9,200? I'm really interested in the product, and I think this price would be a good compromise for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,200. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,200
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Closing the Gap:**  Bob's offer of $9,200 is closer to my counteroffer of $9,500, indicating he's willing to negotiate.
* **Risk vs. Reward:** While I prefer a higher price, accepting this offer is still a good deal compared to my minimum value ($12,000). 
* **Time Factor:** Continuing the negotiation could take more time and potentially result in a lower price or a stalemate, especially with the option to sell to John.
* **Minimizing Loss:** Accepting Bob's offer will secure a sale and minimize any potential loss from further negotiation. 

Therefore, I'm choosing to accept Bob's offer and finalize the deal."
