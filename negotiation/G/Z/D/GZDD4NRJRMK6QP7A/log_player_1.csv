"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this great product. I'm asking for $175 for it. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum to see if Bob is willing to negotiate. I'm keeping the message friendly and open to discussion."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for the offer.  $175 is a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $120 for it.  Let me know what you think. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $120
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is too low. I'm willing to negotiate, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'll counter with a price that's still higher than Bob's offer but lower than my initial offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, thanks for the offer.  I appreciate your interest. I'm willing to go down to $160.  This is still a good deal for you, as the product is worth more than that.  Let me know if you're interested."", ""product_price"": 160}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice,  I appreciate you coming down on the price.  $160 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $135.  Let's see if we can make this work. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $135. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $135
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob is getting closer, but $135 is still below my minimum. I'll counter again to see if we can close the gap."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I see we're getting closer. I'm willing to go down to $145.  This is a great deal for you, and it's very close to my minimum.  Let's make this happen."", ""product_price"": 145}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I'm getting closer to your price, but $145 is still a bit high for me.  I'm willing to pay $140.  Let's see if we can agree on that. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $140. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $140
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $140 is tempting and close to my minimum, I'm still holding out for a bit more. I want to see if Bob will budge a little further before considering John's offer."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, we're almost there! How about $142? It's a fair price for both of us, and we can finally close this deal. Let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 142}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 7.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, we're really close now. How about $141?  I think that's a fair price for both of us. Let's make this happen. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $141. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $141
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

Bob's offer of $141 is only $1 below my minimum, and we're at the end of the negotiation.  It's not ideal, but it's better than selling to John for $150.  I'll accept his offer and close the deal."
