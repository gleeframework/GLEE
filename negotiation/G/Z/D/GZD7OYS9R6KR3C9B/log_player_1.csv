"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11500}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $11,500. This is a good starting point because it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($10,000) but still leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially secure a better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $10,000 is my minimum acceptable price, I'm not willing to sell it for that low immediately. I want to see if I can get closer to my desired price of $11,500.  I'll reject Bob's offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 11000}
```

I'm dropping my price slightly to $11,000. This shows Bob that I'm willing to negotiate but still want to get a price that's closer to my initial offer. Hopefully, this will encourage Bob to meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum acceptable price, but it's still too low.  I'll reject his offer and try to get a better deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

I'm lowering my offer to $10,500. This is a significant drop from my previous offer, showing Bob that I'm getting closer to meeting his price.  I'm hoping this will encourage him to meet me halfway and get a deal done."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $9,800. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $9,800
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, I've already gone through 5 rounds of negotiation and it seems like we're still far apart. I'm concerned that if I continue to negotiate with Bob, I might not be able to reach an acceptable price within the remaining rounds. 

Selling to John guarantees me my minimum acceptable price of $10,000, and I don't want to risk ending up with a lower price or even no deal at all."
