Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you an exclusive opportunity to purchase the product. Given its value and potential, I believe a price of $1,300,000 is fair. This offer stands for 24 hours before I consider other potential buyers."", 
""product_price"": 1300000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,500,000) as possible.
* **Negotiating Room:** Starting with $1,300,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, but still keeps the offer significantly above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Urgency:** The 24-hour limit encourages Bob to make a decision quickly and prevents prolonged negotiations.

**Important Note:**  This strategy assumes you have no information about Bob's negotiation style or how badly he needs the product. If you had more insights into Bob, you could tailor your approach further."
