Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price that balances our valuations and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.

It seems like Alice is unlikely to budge much further on her price. Her latest counteroffer is a significant jump from her previous offer, suggesting she's getting closer to her limit. It's time to cut losses and secure the product from John for $12,000 before potentially missing out on the deal altogether."
