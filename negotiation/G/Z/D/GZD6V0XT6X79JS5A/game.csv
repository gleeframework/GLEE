"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but $11,000 is a bit too high for me.  Would you consider $10,500?",10500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob. However, I'm not quite willing to go as low as $10,500. I'm willing to meet you halfway, so I'm counteroffering at $11,250. This is a fair price that balances our valuations and I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us.",11250.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your position, Alice.  How about we settle at $10,800?  That's a reasonable compromise, don't you think?",10800.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think we're getting close, Bob. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to get closer to my minimum price. I'm counteroffering at $11,500. This is the lowest I can go, but I think it's still a fair price for both of us.",11500.0,Alice,5,
