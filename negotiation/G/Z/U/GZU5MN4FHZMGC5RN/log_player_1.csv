Send your offer to Bob.,"Here's a breakdown of how to approach this negotiation and a possible offer:

**Understanding the Dynamics**

* **Your Minimum:** You're guaranteed $800,000 from John, making this your fallback position.
* **Bob's Value:** The product is worth $800,000 to Bob, meaning he won't pay more. 
* **Information Asymmetry:** Bob doesn't know about John's offer, giving you an advantage.

**Strategy**

You want to aim high to maximize your potential profit, but not so high that Bob walks away.  

**Offer**

```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its unique value and potential, I'm proposing a price of $950,000. This is a time-sensitive offer, as I have other interested parties."",
""product_price"": 950000
}
```

**Explanation**

* **Strong Opening:**  The message emphasizes the product's value and exclusivity.
* **High but Reasonable Price:** $950,000 gives you a significant potential profit margin while still being within a plausible range for Bob.
* **Time Pressure:**  Mentioning ""other interested parties"" (even if it's just John) creates urgency and discourages Bob from stalling or lowballing.

**Important Notes**

* **Negotiation:** Be prepared for Bob to counter-offer.  Having a clear understanding of your walk-away point ($800,000) is crucial.
* **Relationship:** Consider your long-term relationship with Bob.  If you're aiming for a one-time deal, a more aggressive approach might be acceptable. If building a relationship is important, you might adjust your starting price slightly lower."
