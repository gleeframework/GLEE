"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this amazing product at a special price! Would you like to buy it from me for $100? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
Alice's offer is too high. There's room to negotiate a better price, especially since you know the product's worth less to Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice!  I'm interested, but that price is a bit high for me. Would you consider $85?"",
""product_price"": 85
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting Low but Reasonable:** We're starting with a counteroffer significantly lower than Alice's asking price but still leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Polite and Open to Negotiation:**  The message aims to be respectful and conveys that we're serious about buying but need a better price. 
* **Strategic Positioning:** By starting at $85, we're aiming to meet somewhere in the middle, ideally closer to our target price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your interest in the product, Bob! I can do better than $85, but I need to make a profit. How about $95? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $95
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Alice is moving closer to a reasonable price, but we can likely get it lower.  We're still aiming for a price closer to $80, and it's worth another counteroffer to see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""I understand you need to make a profit, Alice. How about we meet in the middle at $90?"",
""product_price"": 90
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Finding Middle Ground:**  This counteroffer shows willingness to compromise and encourages Alice to do the same.
* **Direct and Clear:** The message is straightforward and proposes a specific price point.
* **Still Within Budget:** $90 keeps us within our budget and leaves room for a final slight concession if needed."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet in the middle, Bob! However, I was thinking more along the lines of $97.50. It's still a good deal for you, and it brings me closer to my desired price. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $97.5. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $97.5
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While not ideal, $97.50 is a reasonable compromise.  

* **Close Enough:**  We're already very close to Alice's likely minimum price. 
* **Time Value:**  Continuing to negotiate could be risky, potentially leading to a stalemate or losing the deal altogether.
* **Significant Savings:** We're still saving a decent amount compared to John's $120 price."
