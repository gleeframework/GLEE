Round 3
Alice's offer:

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $7,000 is a good price for you, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to compromise and offer it to you for $8,500. It's getting close to the minimum I'm willing to accept. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $8,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:** While Alice is showing willingness to negotiate, her current offer of $8,500 is still higher than John's guaranteed price of $8,000.  There's no guarantee that Alice will go any lower, and continuing the negotiation might not result in further savings. Buying from John ensures you get the product at your target price."
