"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I'm offering you my product at a price of $1,250,000. This is a great deal, considering the value of this product. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1250000}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* **Starting High:** I'm starting with a price that's above Bob's perceived value, leaving room for negotiation. 
* **Leaving Room:**  $1,250,000 is still below my minimum,  allowing for potential concessions. 
* **Positive Framing:** My message is positive and emphasizes the value of the product, making it more appealing to Bob. 
* **Open to Negotiation:** The question at the end signals my willingness to negotiate further."

You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,150,000

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum.** While it's closer to my minimum than his previous offer, I still aim to earn as much as possible. 
* **Negotiation is possible:** We're only in Round 2, and I have several rounds left to reach a better price.
* **Potentially squeezing more:** Rejecting his offer now might encourage him to increase his offer in the next round."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your counteroffer, but I'm still aiming for a slightly higher price. Let's meet in the middle at $1,200,000. This would allow for both of us to benefit from this transaction. What are your thoughts?"", ""product_price"": 1200000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Compromise:** I'm offering a price that's a compromise between my previous offer and Bob's offer.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

**Explanation:**

* **Still below minimum:**  While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, it's still below my minimum of $1,500,000.
* **Time is on my side:**  We are only in Round 4, and I have many rounds remaining to potentially push for a higher price.
* **Exploring other options:** It's important to consider if selling to John is a better option at this point. However, I'm still hoping to find a price that works for both of us."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but I can't go lower than $1,175,000.  This would be a fair price, considering the value of the product. It's a significant compromise on my end. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 1175000}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Sticking to the minimum:**  I'm still trying to reach a price as close to my minimum as possible.
* **Emphasizing Compromise:**  I'm framing my offer as a significant compromise to encourage Bob to see it as a reasonable solution.
* **Closing the Gap:**  My counteroffer is getting closer to Bob's offer, showing a willingness to negotiate. 
* **Using a question:**  I'm leaving it open for Bob to consider and respond, pushing the negotiation forward."

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I was thinking more along the lines of $1,075,000. Is that something you'd be willing to consider? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $1,075,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $1,075,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Time is running out:** We are now in Round 6, and with only 4 rounds left, it's becoming increasingly unlikely that Bob will significantly increase his offer.
* **Below Minimum:** Bob's offer is still significantly below my minimum of $1,500,000. 
* **Guarantee:** Selling to John guarantees me my minimum, ensuring a safe and profitable outcome.

While I'm hoping to reach a deal with Bob, the risk of him not increasing his offer further is too high.  Selling to John guarantees a much more favorable outcome."
