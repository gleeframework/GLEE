"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 14000}
```

I'm starting with a high offer of $14,000. This is a good starting point because it leaves room for negotiation but is still close to my minimum acceptable price. I'm confident that Bob will find this offer attractive, considering the value of the product to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,000 is better than nothing, it's still far from my minimum acceptable price. I believe I can get closer to my target value with further negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm counteroffering with $13,000. This is a compromise, moving closer to Bob's offer while still staying above my minimum. I'm hoping Bob will see the value of the product and be willing to meet me in the middle."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $12,500 is getting closer to my minimum, I still believe I can get a better deal. I'm not ready to sell to John just yet. I'm confident that I can get closer to my target value with a few more rounds of negotiation."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13500} 
```

I'm again offering a compromise, this time at $13,500. This is a small increase from my previous offer, showing flexibility while still maintaining a price that is reasonable for me.  I believe that with this offer, Bob will be more likely to accept and we can finally close the deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $13,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $13,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer of $13,000 is finally within my acceptable range. While I would have preferred to close at a higher price, it's important to recognize that this is a good deal considering the value of the product to Bob and the risk of not closing the deal with him at all.  It's important to strike a balance between maximizing profits and securing a deal."
