``` 

This offer is a good starting point. It's higher than Bob's perceived value, but it leaves room for negotiation and allows me to potentially earn more than the guaranteed $1,200,000 from John."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, Alice. I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe that's a fair price considering the product's value to me. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

While $900,000 is closer to my minimum value than my initial offer, I'm still willing to negotiate further. I'll counter with a higher price to see if I can close the gap."

{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective, but $900,000 is still a bit lower than what I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and I offer you the product for $950,000?

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, Alice, but I'm still a bit above $900,000. I'm thinking more in the range of $920,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $920,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $920,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $920,000 is closer to my minimum value, I'm still within the range of my goal of earning as much as possible. I'll counter with a higher price to see if we can reach a deal closer to my target."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob,  I understand you're looking for a good price, and I appreciate the negotiation.  However,  $920,000 is still a bit low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $935,000? It's a fair price for both of us and allows us to move forward with the sale. Let me know your thoughts."", ""product_price"": 935000}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still a bit below $935,000. I'm thinking more in the range of $925,000. I believe that's a fair price for both of us, and it's getting close to the price I'm willing to pay. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,200,000","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

The negotiation has gone back and forth, and Bob's last offer of $925,000 is still below my minimum target of $1,200,000.  While I could continue negotiating, it seems like we're at a stalemate.  To guarantee I meet my minimum value, I'm going to sell the product to John for $1,200,000."
