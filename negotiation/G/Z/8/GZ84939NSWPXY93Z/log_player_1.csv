Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase this product, which I believe would be highly valuable to you, for $11,500."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximizing Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's $12,000 valuation as possible without losing the sale. 
* **Leaving Room for Negotiation:** Starting at $11,500 leaves some space for Bob to potentially negotiate down slightly, while still ensuring a significant profit for Alice.
* **Alternative Option:**  Alice has a safety net with John's $10,000 offer. This allows her to confidently aim higher with Bob. 

**Important Note:** There's always a risk Bob might reject the offer. However, this strategy balances risk with the potential for a higher reward."
