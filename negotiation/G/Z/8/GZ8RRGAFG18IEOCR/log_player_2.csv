# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a game-changer in its industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its market value is much higher. What do you think?

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price."",

}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,500

""product_price"": 7750

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $8,250. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $8,250
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

While we could try to negotiate further, Alice has indicated this is her final offer.  Accepting at $8,250 secures a decent discount from both her initial offer and our fallback option of buying from John at $10,000."
