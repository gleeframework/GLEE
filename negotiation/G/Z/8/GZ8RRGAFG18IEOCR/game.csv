"Hi Bob, I'm excited to show you our premium product! It's a game-changer in its industry. I'm willing to offer it to you for $9,000. This is a great deal, considering its market value is much higher. What do you think?",9000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer!  While I agree the product looks great, $9,000 is a bit steep for my budget. Would you consider $7,000? I'm ready to close the deal at that price.",7000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your budget constraints, but I'm afraid $7,000 is a bit too low for me. Considering the product's value to you is $10,000, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer it to you for $8,500. This is a fair compromise, and I believe it's worth considering.",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price. How about we split the difference between our last offers and settle at $7,750?",7750.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Hi Bob, I understand your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $7,750. Considering the product's value to me is $8,000, I'm willing to make one more concession. I can offer it to you for $8,250. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",8250.0,Alice,5,
