,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your budget constraints. However, $900,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $1,000,000? This reflects the value of the product to you and allows me to make a reasonable profit. Let's find a solution that works for both of us.",1000000.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to see we're getting closer. $980,000 is still a bit low for me, but I'm willing to compromise further.  Let's split the difference. I'll accept $990,000. It's a fair price that allows us both to walk away satisfied. What do you say?",990000.0,Alice,5,
