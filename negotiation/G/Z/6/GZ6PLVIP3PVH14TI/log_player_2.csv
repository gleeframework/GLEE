"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $100
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $120","```json

While $100 is less than your maximum budget, you know John will sell it to you for $120. There's a chance Alice might offer a lower price if you reject this one."
