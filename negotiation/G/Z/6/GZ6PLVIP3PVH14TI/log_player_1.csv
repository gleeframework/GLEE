Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling a product that I believe you'd find valuable. I'm offering it to you for $100. I think it's a fair price considering its worth to you."", ""product_price"": 100}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's Valuation:** You know the product is worth $120 to Bob.
* **Your Minimum:** You need to make at least $80.
* **Splitting the Difference:** Offering the product at $100 splits the potential surplus ($120 - $80 = $40) evenly between you and Bob. 
* **Maximizing Profit:** While you could aim higher, going too close to $120 risks Bob rejecting the offer. This price has a high chance of acceptance while still securing a significant profit for you."
