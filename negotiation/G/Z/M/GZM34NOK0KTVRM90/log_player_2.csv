"Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

You are aiming to save as much money as possible. While $12,000 is better than $15,000, there's still room for negotiation. Rejecting Alice's offer allows you to try and get a better price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""product_price"": 10500}
```

**Explanation:**

Since you know Alice values the product at $10,000, offering slightly above that amount ($10,500) leaves room for a potential deal while still saving you a significant amount compared to Alice's initial offer and John's price."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $15,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice's offer of $11,500 is still better than buying from John for $15,000.  While you could try to negotiate further, there's a risk that Alice will reject your next counteroffer and you might end up having to buy from John anyway. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product at a good price without the risk of losing the deal."
