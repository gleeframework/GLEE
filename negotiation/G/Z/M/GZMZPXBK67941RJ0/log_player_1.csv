I'm going to reject Bob's offer and try to get closer to my desired price.  I'm still confident I can get more than $130."

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 
 
I'm going to reject Bob's offer. While $125 is close to my minimum, I believe I can get a better deal if I continue negotiating. There are still several rounds left, and I can always sell to John for $120 as a last resort."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but I'm not willing to go lower than $130.  It's a fair price for a quality product.  Let's close this deal."", ""product_price"": 130}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:

# Bob's offer: The product price will be $128. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $128
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

I'm going to accept Bob's offer. While it's not my ideal price, it's only slightly lower than my minimum acceptable price and it's getting close to my last resort option of selling to John for $120.  There's a chance I could get a better price in the remaining rounds, but there's also a risk that Bob might walk away or the deal might fall through. It's better to secure a decent deal now than risk getting nothing."
