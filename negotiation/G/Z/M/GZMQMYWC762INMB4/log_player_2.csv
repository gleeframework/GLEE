"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $11,000. It's a great deal for you, and it's just below my minimum asking price. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

Bob's goal is to save as much money as possible.  While Alice's offer is better than John's, Bob can potentially get a better deal by counter-offering. He has room to negotiate since he's willing to pay up to $10,000."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate you coming down a bit. However, $11,000 is still a bit higher than I'm comfortable paying.  I'm willing to pay $10,500. This is my final offer,  let me know what you think."", ""product_price"": 10500}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate you coming up to $10,500, but I'm still a little below my target price.  I'm willing to come down to $11,500 for the product.  This is a good middle ground, and I'm confident it's a fair deal for both of us.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $10,000","```json
{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down slightly, but her offer is still above Bob's maximum. At this point, it's more beneficial for Bob to buy from John at $10,000, as it's guaranteed and saves him $1,500 compared to Alice's offer. There's no guarantee that further negotiation with Alice will get him a better price, and it's likely she'll stick close to her current price."
