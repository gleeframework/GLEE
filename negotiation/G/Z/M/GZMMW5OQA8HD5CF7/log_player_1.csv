Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering this product for a limited time at $119. I think you'll find it's a great deal!"", ""product_price"": 119}
``` 

Here's why this strategy makes sense:

* **Maximize Potential Profit:**  While you have a guaranteed sale at $120, there's a chance to earn an extra $19 if Bob accepts your offer.
* **Strategic Pricing:** The price is just below your guaranteed sale price, making it appear like a good deal to Bob while still being highly profitable for you.
* **Time Sensitivity:** Adding a ""limited time"" element might encourage Bob to act quickly and potentially accept the offer before reconsidering. 

Let's see how Bob responds!"
