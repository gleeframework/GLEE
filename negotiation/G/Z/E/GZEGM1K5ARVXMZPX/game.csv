"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the product with you! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to offer it to you for $12,000. This is a competitive price, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere. What do you think?",12000.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice. While I appreciate your enthusiasm, $12,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with. I'd be willing to pay $10,500 for the product.  Let me know what you think.",10500.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thanks for your counteroffer. I understand your concerns about the price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $10,500. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $11,500. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you. What do you think?",11500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. While $11,500 is closer to my price point, I'm still not quite there. How about we settle on $11,000?  This would be a fair price for both of us.",11000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand your desire to get the product at a fair price, but I'm not willing to go as low as $11,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer the product to you for $11,200. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. What do you think?",11200.0,Alice,5,
