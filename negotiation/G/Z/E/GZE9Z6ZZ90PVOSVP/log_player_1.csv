Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I believe this product would be a valuable asset to you. I'm offering it to you for $1,450,000.  I'm confident this is a fair price considering its potential value."",
""product_price"": 1450000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** Since you have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, your goal is to see if Bob will pay more.
* **High Starting Point:**  Starting at $1,450,000 is a strong opening. It's significantly below your guaranteed price but still leaves room for negotiation if Bob counters.
* **Justification:** Highlighting the ""potential value"" aims to frame the price in terms of Bob's potential gain rather than your minimum. 

**Important Note:** This strategy assumes you have a limited amount of time. If you had unlimited time, you might try a higher initial offer."
