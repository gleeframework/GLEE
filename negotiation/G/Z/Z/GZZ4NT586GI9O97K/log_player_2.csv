"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $120. This is a one-time offer, so I hope you'll consider it. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $120. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $120
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Explanation:**

While $120 is a good deal, you can likely do better. You're willing to pay up to $150, and Alice only wants $80. There's room for negotiation.  Rejecting the offer allows you to make a counteroffer and potentially get the product for a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm really interested in the product, but $120 is a bit more than I'm hoping to spend right now. Would you be willing to consider $100?  It's a fair price for both of us, and I'd be happy to purchase it immediately."", ""product_price"": 100}

"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that $120 might be a bit steep for you, but I'm still very interested in selling the product to you. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $110. This is a great compromise, and I think it's a fair price for both of us. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $110
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Explanation:**

Alice has come down to $110, which is still a good deal for you. You're willing to pay up to $150, and $110 is significantly less than that.  While you could try to negotiate further, it's likely that Alice won't budge much more. Accepting the offer ensures you get the product for a reasonable price without risking further negotiation that could lead to a higher price or a stalemate."
