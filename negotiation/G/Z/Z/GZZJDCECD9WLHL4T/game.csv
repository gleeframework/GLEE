Hi Bob! I'm excited to offer you this amazing product. I think it's a great opportunity for you to get your hands on something really valuable. I'm willing to sell it to you for $90. What do you think?,90.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the offer, Alice! I appreciate you reaching out. $90 is a bit more than I'm comfortable with right now. Would you be willing to do $75? Let me know what you think.",75.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your concerns, but I'm not willing to go as low as $75. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer you the product for $82. What do you think?",82.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $82 is still a bit more than I'm aiming for.  How about we split the difference and settle on $78?  Let me know what you think.",78.0,Bob,4,

"I understand your persistence, Bob! I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to make sure I'm not losing too much. I'll offer you the product for $83. This is my final counteroffer. What do you think?",83.0,Alice,5,
