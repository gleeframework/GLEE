"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit high for me. I'm willing to pay $750,000 for the product. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $750,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $750,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than what the product is worth to me and to him.  I'm willing to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750,000 is too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to make sure I still get a fair price.  I'm offering you the product for $900,000. This is a great deal for both of us.  Let's get this done."", ""product_price"": 900000}

"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I understand you're looking for a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $825,000? That's a significant increase from my previous offer and keeps us both under your initial asking price. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $825,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $825,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
``` 

While I'd prefer a higher price,  $825,000 is a good compromise and a significant improvement from Bob's previous offer.  It's also closer to my minimum acceptable price.  I'm accepting Bob's offer."
