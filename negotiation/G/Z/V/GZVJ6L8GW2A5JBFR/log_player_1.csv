Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the opportunity to purchase the product for $11,500. I know it's valuable to you, and I believe this is a fair price that reflects its worth."", 
""product_price"": 11500
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:** My goal is to earn as much as possible, and Bob is willing to pay more than my minimum price.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  While I start high, the offer leaves some room for Bob to negotiate if he wants. 
* **Above My Minimum:** Even if Bob negotiates down slightly, I'm still likely to get a better price than the $10,000 John offers.
* **Time Value of Money:**  Selling to Bob quickly is preferable to waiting for John, even if the difference in price isn't huge."
