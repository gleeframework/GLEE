# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you this exceptional product. It's a rare opportunity to own a unique item that I'm sure you'll love. I'm willing to start the conversation with a price of $1,200,000.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is above your maximum price point of $1,000,000. While you're looking to buy the product, saving money is a priority. You can likely get a better deal by rejecting the offer and negotiating."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I understand that $1,000,000 is your budget, but I'm not willing to go that low. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $1,150,000. I think this is a fair price considering the product's value and uniqueness.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $1,150,000 is still above your budget of $1,000,000.  While it's closer, it's still not a price you're willing to accept. You can likely continue negotiating and potentially get a better deal."

"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm not willing to go down to $1,050,000. I think the product's value is worth more than that. I'm willing to meet you at $1,100,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. I'm not sure how much longer I'll be able to hold off on other interested buyers. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,100,000.

{""decision"": ""BuyFromJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

While Alice has come down to $1,100,000, it's still outside your budget of $1,000,000. You've already indicated that you have an alternative purchase available for $1,000,000.  Given the risk of further negotiations not leading to a lower price, it's more efficient and cost-effective to purchase from John at this point."
