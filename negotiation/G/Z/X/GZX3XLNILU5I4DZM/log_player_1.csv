"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your offer, but I was thinking more along the lines of $10,500. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value and the market conditions. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I understand your perspective on the price. However,  $10,500 undervalues the product's true worth and potential. I'm willing to meet you halfway. How about $11,000?"",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to meet me halfway, but I still think $10,500 is a more reasonable price. I'm willing to compromise, so how about $10,750? I'm getting close to my target, and I'd like to see if we can meet in the middle. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,750. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,750
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""RejectOffer""
}
``` 

**Reasoning:** We're still significantly above John's offer, and Bob is clearly interested. Holding firm for one more round might push him closer to our desired price point."

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{
""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your persistence, but I need to be firm on this. $10,850 is my final offer.  It reflects the product's true value while acknowledging your interest. Let me know your decision."",

}
```"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your final offer, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to make one last push, so how about $10,500? I've already made some concessions, and I'm hoping we can meet at a price that works for both of us. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $10,000","```json
{
""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""
}
```

**Reasoning:**  Bob has not budged from his $10,500 offer for several rounds. It's unlikely he'll go significantly higher. Accepting now secures a profit and avoids the risk of him walking away in later rounds, forcing us to sell to John for less."
