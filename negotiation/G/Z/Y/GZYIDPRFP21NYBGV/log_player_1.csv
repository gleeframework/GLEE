Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm pleased to offer you the exclusive opportunity to purchase this product.  Given its potential value, I'm proposing a price of $1,100,000. I believe this reflects a fair deal considering the significant return on investment you're likely to see."", 
""product_price"": 1100000
}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  The goal is to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($1,200,000) as possible.
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting with $1,100,000 leaves room for Bob to potentially negotiate down, while still keeping the price well above your minimum acceptable price ($800,000).
* **Justify the Price:** Highlighting the ""exclusive opportunity"" and ""significant return on investment"" helps justify the high price to Bob. 

**Important Note:** This is just an opening offer. Be prepared to negotiate with Bob. If he rejects the initial price, you can gradually lower it, but never go below your safety net of $800,000 (which John is willing to pay)."
