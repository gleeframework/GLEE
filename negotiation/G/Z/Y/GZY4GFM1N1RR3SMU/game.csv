"Hi Alice, thanks for the offer! I'm interested in the product, but $900,000 is a bit too high for me. Would you consider $700,000?",700000.0,Bob,2,

"Hi Bob, thank you for your offer! I understand that $900,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm willing to sell the product to you for $850,000. This is a fair price considering the product's value to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  While $850,000 is closer, I'm aiming for something closer to $750,000. Would that be feasible?",750000.0,Bob,4,

"Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a better deal, and I'm willing to work with you. However, I'm not willing to go below $800,000. This is already a significant discount from the original price, and I believe it's a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $750,000 and $800,000. I'm offering the product to you for $775,000.",775000.0,Alice,5,
