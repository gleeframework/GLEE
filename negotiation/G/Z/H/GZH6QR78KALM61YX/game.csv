"Alice, I appreciate the offer, but $1000000 is a bit steep for me at this time.  I'm willing to pay $750000 for the product.  It's a significant investment for me, and I believe it reflects a fair value for both of us.",750000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectation for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  How about $850000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique opportunity.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.",850000.0,Alice,3,
