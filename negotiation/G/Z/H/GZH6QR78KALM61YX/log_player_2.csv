"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1000000. It's a unique opportunity to acquire something truly valuable.  I'm confident this is a fair price, but I'm open to discussion. Let me know your thoughts. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,000,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's offer is at your maximum price.** There's no immediate benefit to accepting.
* **Rejecting allows you to potentially negotiate a lower price.**  While Alice might be firm, you have the opportunity to try. 
* **Buying from John is the same price.**  This option is only beneficial if negotiations with Alice fail."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $750000 doesn't quite meet my minimum expectation for this product. I'm willing to come down a bit, however.  How about $850000? It's a fair price that reflects the value of this unique opportunity.  Let's work together to find a solution that benefits both of us.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Alice's counteroffer is closer to your desired price, but still above your initial counteroffer.**  This indicates she's willing to negotiate further.
* **Rejecting gives you another opportunity to counter and potentially lower the price further.** 
* **Buying from John is still the same price.** There's no immediate advantage to switching sellers."
