Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm offering you the chance to buy this product, which I believe you'll find quite valuable. I'm asking for $140. Let me know if you're interested!"", 
""product_price"": 140
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Maximize Profit:**  We want to get as close to Bob's perceived value ($150) as possible without making him reject the offer. 
* **Leave Room for Negotiation:**  Starting slightly higher gives us some wiggle room if Bob tries to negotiate the price down. 
* **Consider the Alternative:** We know we can get $100 from John, so our offer must be appealing enough for Bob to choose us over that option.

By offering the product at $140, we are aiming for a significant profit while still making the deal attractive to Bob."
