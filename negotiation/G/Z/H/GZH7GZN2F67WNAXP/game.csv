"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling this valuable product to you. I believe it's a great opportunity for both of us to make a deal. I'm willing to sell it to you for $1200000. I think this is a fair price considering its value to you, and it's a significant discount from its true worth to me.",1200000.0,Alice,1,

"I appreciate your enthusiasm for the deal, Alice, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900000. I believe that's a more reasonable price considering the product's value to me.",900000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand your perspective, but I'm afraid I need to prioritize my own interests. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer a price of $1100000. I believe this is a fair compromise considering the product's value to me and your initial offer.",1100000.0,Alice,3,

"I understand your concerns, Bob, and I appreciate your persistence. However, I'm not willing to go below $1050000. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for the product. I'm willing to meet you at $1025000. This is my final offer.",1025000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your persistence, Alice, but I'm afraid I've reached my budget limit. I'm willing to walk away if we can't come to a mutually agreeable price. I'm willing to make one final offer of $925000. If you're not willing to meet me at this price, I'll have to consider buying from John for $800000.",925000.0,Bob,6,
