"Alice, thanks for the opening offer.  While I agree this product is valuable, the price point is a bit high for me. I'd be willing to purchase it for $650,000. Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thank you for your counteroffer, Bob. I understand that $650000 is a bit lower than I was hoping for. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I can offer the product to you for $850000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you coming down in price. I'm definitely interested in finding a way to make this work. How about we meet in the middle of our last two offers at $750,000? I think that's a fair deal that reflects the product's value.",750000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm still not convinced that $750000 is the best price for this product. I'm willing to make another concession, but I need to be closer to my minimum price. I can offer the product to you for $820000. This is a fair price considering the value the product brings to you.",820000.0,Alice,5,
