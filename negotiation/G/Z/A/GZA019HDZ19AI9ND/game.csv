"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $180 might be a bit high for you, but I still think the product is worth a premium. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $160. This is a fair compromise that still reflects the value it brings to you.",160.0,Alice,3,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go as low as $130. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $145. This is the lowest I'm willing to go, but I think it's still a fair price considering the product's value.",145.0,Alice,5,
