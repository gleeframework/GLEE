"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I'm offering you my product for $14,000. It's a great deal for you, and I'm confident you'll find it very valuable. Let me know what you think! 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $14,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $14,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:** Alice's offer is higher than what John is offering. There's room for negotiation to try and get a better price from Alice."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{
""message"": ""Hi Alice, thanks for the offer. I'm interested in the product but $14,000 is a bit steep for me. Would you consider $10,000?"",
""product_price"": 10000
}
```

**Reasoning:** Starting with a significantly lower offer ($10,000) leaves room for negotiation. It also helps gauge Alice's willingness to lower her price and gives us a better understanding of her bottom line."
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I appreciate your interest, but $10,000 is unfortunately too low for me. How about we meet in the middle at $12,000?  This would still be a great price for you, and it's closer to what I need. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:** Alice has met our desired price. There's no point in continuing the negotiation since we can buy it for the same price from John.  We'll accept her offer and save the most money possible."
