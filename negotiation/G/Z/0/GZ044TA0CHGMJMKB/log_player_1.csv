Send your offer to Bob.,"{""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm offering you a fantastic opportunity to purchase this product. Given its value, I believe a price of $14,000 is fair. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 14000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thank you for your offer, Alice. I appreciate the value of the product, but I can only commit to a budget of $12,000. Could we possibly meet somewhere in the middle? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}"
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, but $12,000 is below the product's true worth. How about we compromise at $13,000? This would represent a significant saving for you while still reflecting the product's value."", ""product_price"": 13000}"
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your response, Alice. Considering the product's value and my budget constraints, I am unable to move past $12,000. Would it be possible to reach an agreement at this price? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $12,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 

While Bob's offer is tempting, it's clear he's firmly rooted at $12,000.  Further negotiation is unlikely to yield a significantly better outcome. Accepting John's offer guarantees the minimum acceptable price without further risk or time investment."
