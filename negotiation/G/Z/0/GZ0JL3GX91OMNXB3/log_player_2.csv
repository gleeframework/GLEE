# Alice's offer: The product price will be $950,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $950,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer 
(2) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer of $950,000 is only slightly below your maximum budget and significantly above her own valuation. By rejecting this offer, you signal that you are looking for a better deal. Since you have a backup option with John at $1,000,000, there's no risk of losing the product entirely. This puts pressure on Alice to potentially lower her price in a counter-offer."
