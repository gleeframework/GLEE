"Thanks for the offer, Alice. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate.  I'm interested in the product, but I'm going to need to come in a bit lower to make it work for me.  How about $850,000?  I believe this is still a fair price for both of us.",850000.0,Bob,2,

"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob. I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, I was thinking more along the lines of $875,000. I believe this is a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",875000.0,Alice,3,

"I'm glad we're getting closer, Bob. I can see you're serious about making a deal. I'm willing to meet you at $880,000. This is as low as I'm willing to go, but I think it's a fair price considering the product's value to you. What do you think?",880000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I understand your position, but I'm still a bit hesitant at that price.  Let's split the difference.  I'm happy to close the deal at $870,000. This would be a fair compromise, and we can finalize everything quickly.  What do you say?",870000.0,Bob,6,

"I appreciate your persistence, Bob. However, I'm not quite ready to meet you at $870,000. I'm willing to go a bit lower, but I need to think about my costs and my minimum requirements. I can do $885,000, but that's as low as I'm willing to go. This is my final offer, Bob.",885000.0,Alice,7,
