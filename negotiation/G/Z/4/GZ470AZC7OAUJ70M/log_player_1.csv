Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""product_price"": 130}
``` 

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than what the product is worth to me, hoping to maximize my profit.  I'll see if Bob is willing to pay a premium."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $115. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $115
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

While $115 is better than nothing, it's still below my minimum acceptable price of $120. I'll counteroffer and see if we can reach a compromise."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 118}
```

I'm offering a slight compromise by lowering my price to $118.  This is still above Bob's offer, but it shows I'm willing to negotiate and hopefully we can reach a deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer: The product price will be $117. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $117
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

While $117 is close to my minimum, I've had enough negotiation rounds.  John is guaranteed to pay my minimum price, so I'll sell to him to avoid further haggling and potential risk."
