"Round 1
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I'm excited to offer you a unique opportunity to acquire a high-value product. I believe it's worth a significant investment, and I'm willing to start with a competitive price of $900000. What are your thoughts? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $900,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $900,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

As Bob, I'm aiming to save as much money as possible.  Alice's initial offer of $900,000 is a good starting point, but there's room for negotiation. I want to see if I can get a better price.  Rejecting the offer allows me to make a counteroffer and potentially secure a lower price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 2
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Thank you for the offer, Alice.  While I see the value in this product, $900,000 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this stage.  I'm prepared to offer $800,000.  Let's see if we can find some common ground."", ""product_price"": 800000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 2.

Round 3
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $800000 is a bit lower than my initial price, but I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'm counteroffering at $850000. I believe this price reflects the product's value while still being a good deal for you. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $850,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $850,000

(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has moved closer to my initial counteroffer, but there's still room for negotiation. I'm determined to save as much money as possible.  By rejecting this offer, I can try to push for a lower price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Round 4
Send your counteroffer to Alice.","```json
{""message"": ""Alice, I appreciate your willingness to negotiate. However, $850,000 is still a bit high for me. I'm willing to go up to $825,000. This is a fair price that recognizes the product's value while still allowing me to stay within my budget. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 825000}
```"
"Alice rejected your offer from round 4.

Round 5
Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: I appreciate your flexibility, Bob. I'm willing to meet you at $825000, but I'd like to add a bit more value to the deal. I'm willing to throw in some additional support and maintenance services for the product, which will increase its overall value. Considering this, I'm willing to meet you at $835000. What do you think? 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $835,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $835,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,000,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice has come down to $835,000, which is a good price considering the added value of the support and maintenance services. While I could potentially keep negotiating, there's a risk that Alice will get frustrated and either raise the price or call off the deal entirely.  At this point, it's more beneficial to accept the offer and secure the product with the added value, rather than risk losing the opportunity altogether."
