"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the possibility of selling you this incredible product. I believe it's a game-changer, and I think you'll love it.

**Reasoning:**

Alice's offer is higher than her value for the product but lower than your maximum budget. It's worth trying to negotiate further to see if you can get a better price."

Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Thanks for your offer, Bob. I understand that you're trying to stay within your budget, but I'm not willing to go as low as $1,250,000. However, I'm willing to meet you halfway. I'll offer it to you for $1,275,000. This is a fair price considering its value to you is $1,500,000. Let's see if we can come to an agreement. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,275,000.

(1) Accept Alice's offer, and buy the product for $1,275,000
(2) Reject Alice's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Alice a counteroffer 
(3) Buy the product from Jhon for $1,500,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

Alice's new offer is $1,275,000. This is still within my budget and represents a good deal for me.  While I could try to negotiate further, the risk is that Alice might reject my counteroffer and ultimately I might have to buy from John at a higher price. It's a good idea to accept the offer and secure the product at a reasonable price."
