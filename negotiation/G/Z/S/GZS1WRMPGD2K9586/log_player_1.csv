Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{
""message"": ""Hello Bob, I'm excited to offer you the opportunity to purchase this product.  I believe it holds significant value for you, and I'm confident you'll find it highly beneficial. I'm asking for $1,350,000. Let me know your thoughts, and we can discuss further."",
""product_price"": 1350000
}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **High starting point:** Since I have a guaranteed buyer (John) at $1,500,000, I want to start negotiations at a price closer to that amount. 
* **Leaving room for negotiation:**  Offering a price slightly lower than John's offer leaves room for potential negotiation with Bob while still aiming for a higher profit.
* **Highlighting value to Bob:**  The message emphasizes the product's value to Bob, aiming to increase his perceived value and willingness to pay. 
 
This strategy aims to find a balance between maximizing profit and securing a deal with Bob."
