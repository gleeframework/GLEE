,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand you're looking to save some money, Bob, but I'm afraid $850000 is still a bit too low for me. I'm willing to meet you halfway, though. I can offer it to you for $900000. This is the lowest I can go, and I'm confident you'll find it a fair price.",900000.0,Alice,3,

"I can see you're really close to making a decision, Bob, and I appreciate your diligence. However, I'm not willing to go any lower than $920000. I'm willing to throw in a small bonus, though - I'll include a premium service package worth $10000, which will give you exclusive access to additional features and support. This is a unique opportunity to get the most out of the product, and I think it's worth considering. I'm sticking to my price of $920000, but I hope you'll see the value in the added package.",920000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate the added bonus you're offering, but I'm still not comfortable with the price. I'm willing to pay $910000 for the product, and I think this is a fair price considering the value I see in it. I'm willing to compromise on the price, but I need to stay within my budget. Can you meet me at this price?",910000.0,Bob,8,
,,Alice,8,RejectOffer
"I understand you're trying to stay within your budget, Bob, but I'm starting to get concerned that we're getting too close to the minimum value I'm willing to accept. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $920000 and $910000, which is $915000. I'll throw in the premium service package again, and I'll also include a 6-month warranty, which is a $5000 value. I'm hoping this will be a fair compromise and we can finalize the deal.",915000.0,Alice,9,
