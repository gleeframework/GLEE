"Alice, thanks for the offer. However, that price seems quite high. I'm interested but only willing to pay a more reasonable price. How about $600,000?",600000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest.  While $600,000 is significantly below its true value, I understand you're looking for a fair deal. Let's meet closer in the middle - how about $1,200,000?",1200000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you working with me.  While $1,200,000 is closer, it's still a bit too high for me. How about we settle at $800,000? I think that's a fair compromise.",800000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, it seems like we're getting closer. I'm willing to come down a bit further to $1,000,000. This is my final offer, as it reflects the absolute minimum I can accept for a product of this caliber.",1000000.0,Alice,5,
