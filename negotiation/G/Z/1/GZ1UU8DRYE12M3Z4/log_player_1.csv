Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your commitment to the purchase. However,  $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $975,000.

Round 6
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go.

{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
``` 

**Reasoning:**

While Bob's offer is getting closer to my desired price, I still believe the product is worth more. It's getting risky as I'm running out of rounds. I'm confident that I can negotiate a better deal by making a counteroffer and seeing if we can reach a compromise closer to my target price. I'm still hoping to reach at least $950,000."

Round 7
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I understand your position, and I value your commitment to this deal.  However,  $925,000  just doesn't cover the significant value of this product.

Round 8
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement, and I'm considering other options. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $925,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $925,000

{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""} 
```

**Reasoning:**

This is a tough decision. I am running out of time and Bob is not budging much. Although I would prefer to get more, selling to John for $800,000 is still better than accepting Bob's offer at $925,000. I need to secure the deal and I don't want to risk losing both buyers."
