"I'm interested in the product, but I was thinking more along the lines of $900,000. I believe this is a more reasonable price considering the market value of similar products.",900000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest and understand your perspective on the price. While I value your offer, I'm still hoping to reach a price that reflects the true value of this product. I'm willing to come down to $1,000,000. This is a fair compromise that allows us both to benefit from the deal. Let's continue the conversation.",1000000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still a bit hesitant to go up to $1,000,000. How about we meet in the middle at $950,000? I think this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",950000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand your position, and I appreciate your commitment to the purchase. However,  $950,000 doesn't quite reflect the true value of this product.  Let's try $975,000. This is a final compromise on my end, but I believe it's a fair price that balances both our needs.  I'm confident this deal will be mutually beneficial in the long run.",975000.0,Alice,5,

"I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but I'm still not comfortable with $975,000. I'm willing to go up to $925,000, but that's as high as I'm willing to go. I believe this is a fair price that reflects the value of the product, and I'm willing to make a serious commitment to purchase it.",925000.0,Bob,6,

"Bob, I understand your position, and I value your commitment to this deal.  However,  $925,000  just doesn't cover the significant value of this product.  To bridge the gap, I'm willing to offer it for $950,000.  This is my final offer, and I believe it's a fair compromise that recognizes the value we both see in this product.  Let's close this deal!",950000.0,Alice,7,

"I appreciate your persistence, but I'm still not comfortable with $950,000. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $925,000, but I'm not going any higher. I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we're not going to be able to come to an agreement, and I'm considering other options.",925000.0,Bob,8,
