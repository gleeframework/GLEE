"Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Bob, I'm offering you the product for $1,000,000.  It's a great deal for both of us.  You'll save $200,000, and I'll still get a fair price.  Let me know what you think. 
# Alice's offer: The product price will be $1,000,000.

You can get the product for $800,000 from John, which is lower than Alice's offer of $1,000,000.  It's always better to save money!"
