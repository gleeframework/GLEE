"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, but $7,000 is simply too low for me. I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to at least get $8,500 for the product. Let's meet in the middle. What do you say?",8500.0,Alice,3,

"Bob, I'm happy to continue negotiating with you. How about we compromise at $8,250? This would be a good deal for both of us, allowing you to get the product at a reasonable price and me to earn a fair profit. Let's make a deal!",8250.0,Alice,5,
