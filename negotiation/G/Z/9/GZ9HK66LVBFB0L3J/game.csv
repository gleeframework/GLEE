"Alice, thanks for the offer.  While I appreciate the product, $18,000 is too high for me.  I'm willing to pay $12,000 for it. This is a fair price considering the value to me. What do you think?",12000.0,Bob,2,

"Thank you for your offer, Bob. I understand that $18,000 is a bit steep for you, but I'm still looking to get a good price for the product. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer it to you for $16,000. This is a fair compromise, considering the product's value to you is $10,000. What do you think?",16000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice,  I appreciate you coming down a bit, but $16,000 is still outside my budget. I'm firm on my offer of $12,000.  It's a fair price for both of us, and it's the most I can afford right now.  Let's see if we can reach an agreement.",12000.0,Bob,4,

"I understand that you're firm on your offer, Bob, but I'm still not willing to sell the product for $12,000. I'm willing to make one more concession and offer it to you for $14,000. This is the lowest price I'm willing to accept, and I think it's still a good deal for both of us. What do you think?",14000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility, but $14,000 is still a bit too high for me. I'm willing to pay $13,000, which is a fair price considering the value to me and your concessions. Let's see if we can finally close this deal.",13000.0,Bob,6,

"I understand that you're trying to get a good deal, Bob, but I'm not willing to go any lower than $14,000. I've already made a significant concession, and I think this price is still a fair compromise. I'm willing to meet you halfway between $13,000 and $14,000, so I'll offer it to you for $13,500. This is my final offer, and I hope we can come to an agreement.",13500.0,Alice,7,
,,Bob,7,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your flexibility and your final offer.  However, I'm still hoping to close this deal at a lower price.  How about we split the difference between your last offer and my last offer, and I'll pay $13,250.  This would be a good deal for both of us, and would allow us to finalize this sale.",13250.0,Bob,8,
