Send your offer to Bob.,"```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'd really love. I'm asking for $175 for it.  Let me know what you think!"", ""product_price"": 175}
``` 

**Reasoning:**

* **Starting high:** I'm starting with a price higher than what I know the product is worth to Bob, but still lower than my minimum acceptable price. This gives me room to negotiate.
* **Enthusiasm:**  A positive message encourages Bob to engage in the negotiation. 
* **Leaving room for counteroffers:** The price is not too aggressive, giving Bob space to make a counteroffer without feeling like I'm being unreasonable. 

This strategy allows me to gauge Bob's interest and potentially reach a price closer to my desired amount while also giving me the option to move on to John if the negotiation doesn't work out."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, thanks for offering! That's a bit too steep for me though. Would you consider $80? 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $80. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $80
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is too low:**  $80 is significantly below my minimum acceptable price of $150, and also below the product's value to Bob ($100).
* **Negotiation potential:**  While I could accept his offer and make a quick sale, I believe there's room for negotiation. I can counter with a price closer to my minimum acceptable price and see if we can find a middle ground. 
* **Selling to John is still an option:**  If Bob refuses to budge, I can still sell to John for $150."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Alice.

Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hey Bob, I appreciate you making an offer. While $80 is a bit too low for me, I'm willing to come down to $120.  Let's meet in the middle.  What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Counter with a reasonable price:**  $120 is a significant increase from Bob's offer but still below my minimum acceptable price.  It shows I'm willing to negotiate.
* **Emphasize meeting in the middle:**  This encourages Bob to consider a compromise, as he's also likely aiming for a price closer to $100.
* **Maintain a positive tone:**  Being friendly and open to discussion can encourage Bob to continue negotiating. 

This counteroffer gives me a good chance to reach a mutually acceptable price while still protecting my minimum acceptable price. If Bob rejects this offer, I can consider selling to John or making another counteroffer, depending on how determined Bob is."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Hi Alice, I appreciate you coming down on the price.  How about we settle at $100? That's my final offer. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $150","```json
{""decision"": ""SellToJhon""}
```

**Reasoning:**

* **Bob's offer is still below my minimum:** While Bob has come up in price, his offer of $100 is still below my minimum acceptable price of $150.
* **No room for further negotiation:** Bob has declared this his ""final offer,"" indicating that he is unlikely to budge further. 
* **Opportunity cost:**  I'm confident that John is a reliable buyer who is willing to pay my minimum price.  Continuing to negotiate with Bob carries the risk of further delays and the potential for a lower sale price. 

Given these factors, selling the product to John for $150 is the most advantageous option. It guarantees me my minimum acceptable price and eliminates the uncertainty of further negotiation."
