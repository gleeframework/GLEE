Alice's offer:
# Alice's message: Hi Bob, I understand that you're looking for a compromise, and I'm willing to work with you. However, $10,500 is still a bit below my target price. I'm willing to meet you halfway again and offer $10,750. This is the lowest I can go, and I think it's still a great deal for both of us. Let me know if this is something you'd be interested in.

Alice is clearly willing to negotiate, but she's also holding firm to a price above $10,500.  At $10,750, the potential savings of a lower offer are outweighed by the risk that Alice walks away.  This price represents a good compromise."
