"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal, and I'm willing to be flexible.  How about we meet in the middle at $10,500? That gives you a significant savings and me a fair price.  Let's make this happen!",10500.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise, but $10,500 is still a bit too steep for me.  I'm sticking with my previous offer of $9,500. It's a fair price for both of us, and I'm confident we can reach an agreement.",9500.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I see we're both trying to find common ground.  I'm willing to come down a bit more to $10,000. This is a fair price, and it ensures we both get a great deal.  Let's close this deal and move forward!",10000.0,Alice,5,

"Alice, I'm pleased to see we're getting closer.  While $10,000 is an improvement, I'm still aiming for a price closer to $9,500.  How about we settle on $9,750? This would be a fair price for both of us, and we could finally close this deal.",9750.0,Bob,6,
