"Thank you for your offer, Alice. I understand the value of your product, but I believe we can reach a more agreeable price. How about $790,000? This would allow us to both benefit from this transaction.",790000.0,Bob,2,

"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $790,000 is simply too low.  I'm willing to come down a bit, but I need to ensure I get a fair price for my product. How about $820,000? This is still a good deal for both of us.",820000.0,Alice,3,
