"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 15000}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $15,000. This gives me some room to negotiate while still ensuring I make a decent profit.  I'll see how Bob responds before making any adjustments."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $10,000. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $10,000
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm going to reject his offer and try to negotiate a better price.  There are still 8 rounds left, so I have time to see if we can find a mutually agreeable price."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 13000} 
```

I'm going to counter with $13,000. This is still above my minimum price, but it's a significant concession from my initial offer, showing Bob that I'm willing to negotiate.  Let's see if this is more appealing to him."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $11,500. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $11,500
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

Bob's offer is getting closer to my minimum, but it's still a bit low.  I'm going to reject his offer and see if we can bridge the gap.  I still have a few rounds to go before I need to consider selling to John."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 12500} 
```

I'm going to counter with $12,500. This is just $500 above my minimum acceptable price, and I'm hoping Bob will see that it's a reasonable compromise. We are getting close to the end of our negotiations, and I don't want to risk losing out on a potentially better deal."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $12,000.

(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $12,000","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""} 
```

Bob's offer is finally at my minimum acceptable price of $12,000. I'm going to accept his offer, as I don't want to risk losing out on this deal by continuing to negotiate.  There's always a chance that Bob could change his mind, and I'm satisfied with this outcome."
