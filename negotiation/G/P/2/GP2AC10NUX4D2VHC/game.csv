"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you this amazing product! I think it's a great fit for you, and I'm willing to sell it to you for $140. This is a one-time offer, and I'm confident you won't find a better deal elsewhere.",140.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I think the product is great, $140 is a bit too high for my budget. Would you consider a lower price, perhaps around $80?",80.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Thanks for the counteroffer, Bob! I understand your budget constraints, but I'm not willing to go as low as $80. I'm willing to meet you halfway and offer the product to you for $110. This is a fair price considering the product's value and quality. What do you think?",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate you meeting me halfway, Alice. How about we settle at $95? That's a fair compromise, don't you think?",95.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I understand your persistence, Bob, and I appreciate the compromise. However, I'm still not willing to go as low as $95. I'm willing to make one more offer to try to find a mutually beneficial price. I'll offer the product to you for $105. This is my final offer, and I'm confident it's a fair price considering the product's value. What do you think?",105.0,Alice,5,
