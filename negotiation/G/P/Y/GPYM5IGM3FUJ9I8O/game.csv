"Hi Bob, I'm excited to offer you the chance to purchase this product. Given its value, I'm proposing a starting price of $10,000. I'm confident you'll find this a fair offer considering the benefits it will bring to you.",10000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your offer, but $10,000 is significantly over my budget. I'm willing to pay $7,500 for the product.  This is a fair price considering my budget constraints and the value you've placed on the product. What do you think?",7500.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your offer, but $7,500 is a bit too low for me to consider.  This product holds significant value, and I'm sure you understand that. How about we meet in the middle at $9,000?",9000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I understand the value of the product, but $9,000 is still a bit more than I'm comfortable with.  I'm willing to go up to $8,500.  This is a fair price considering my budget and the value you've placed on the product. I believe this would be a win-win for both of us.",8500.0,Bob,4,
