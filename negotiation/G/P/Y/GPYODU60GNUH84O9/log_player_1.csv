"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 130}
```

I'm starting with a price slightly higher than my minimum acceptable price ($120) to see if Bob is willing to pay a premium. If he rejects, we can negotiate further."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer because it's significantly lower than my minimum acceptable price. I'm willing to continue negotiating, as there are still rounds left and I have a fallback option of selling to John for $120."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 125}
```

I'm lowering my price slightly from the previous round, but still above my minimum acceptable price. I'm hoping that Bob will be willing to compromise and meet me halfway."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $110. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $110
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $120","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""} 
```

I'm rejecting Bob's offer again.  While it's closer to my minimum, I'm hoping to get a bit more.  Since I have the option of selling to John, there's still room to negotiate further."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 115}
```

I'm lowering my price again, but still holding out for a price that's closer to my minimum acceptable price.  We're getting close, and I believe this counteroffer is reasonable."
