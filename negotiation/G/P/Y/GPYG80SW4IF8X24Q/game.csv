"Alice, thank you for the offer. While I see the value in this product, $1,400,000 is a bit higher than my current budget. I'm willing to pay $1,300,000. Let's see if we can reach an agreement at that price.",1300000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate you recognizing the value of this product. I'm willing to be flexible, but $1,300,000 is a significant step down from my initial asking price. How about we meet halfway and settle on $1,350,000? This feels like a fair compromise that acknowledges the product's worth.",1350000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate your willingness to compromise.  $1,350,000 is closer, but I'm still a bit above my target.  Let's try $1,325,000.  This feels like a fair compromise that balances the product's worth with my budget.",1325000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, you're clearly serious about this product, and I respect that. Let's find a number we can both agree on. How about $1,340,000? This is a small adjustment on my end, but I believe it reflects the value you'll gain from this deal.",1340000.0,Alice,5,
