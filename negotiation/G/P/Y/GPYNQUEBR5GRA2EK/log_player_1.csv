Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?"", ""product_price"": 120}
``` 

**Explanation:**

* I'm starting with a relatively high offer, but still below what the product is worth to Bob. 
* I'm using a friendly and persuasive message to encourage Bob to accept. 
* This strategy aims to get the negotiation going and hopefully secure a good price without losing too much time in the 10 rounds."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to go down to $100?  
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $100. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $100
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json

* **Strategy:**  This counteroffer allows me to keep the price above my minimum threshold while showing Bob that I'm open to finding a mutually agreeable price."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer:
# Bob's message: Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference - how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal. 
# Bob's offer: The product price will be $105. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $105

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""message"": ""Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity to close this deal. What do you say?"", ""product_price"": 110}
```

**Explanation:**

* **Counteroffer:** I'm sticking with my previous offer of $110.  I'm not giving in to Bob's pressure to drop further, but I'm reiterating my willingness to compromise. 
* **Message:** I'm emphasizing the fairness of the offer and the opportunity to close the deal. This adds a sense of urgency and may encourage Bob to accept. 
* **Strategy:** By sticking with $110, I'm trying to push Bob towards accepting my offer while leaving room for a slight concession if necessary in later rounds."
