"Hi Bob, I'm selling this amazing product that I think you'll really love. I'm asking for $120 for it, which is a great deal considering its value. What do you think?",120.0,Alice,1,

"Thanks for the offer, Alice! While I appreciate the value you're placing on the product, $120 is a bit higher than I'm comfortable with at this time. Would you be willing to go down to $100? ",100.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I understand you're looking for a good deal.  While $100 is appreciated, it's unfortunately a bit lower than I can go right now. I'm willing to come down to $110.  This is still a great price considering the product's value, and I'm confident it's worth it to you. Let's see if we can make this work!",110.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"Alice, I appreciate you coming down to $110, but I'm still a bit hesitant.  Let's split the difference - how about $105? That's a fair price for both of us and allows us to make a deal.",105.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your willingness to compromise. However, $105 is still a bit lower than I can go at this point. I'm willing to meet you in the middle at $110. This is a fair price for both of us and a great opportunity to close this deal. What do you say?",110.0,Alice,5,
