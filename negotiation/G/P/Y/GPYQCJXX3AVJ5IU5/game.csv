"Hello Bob, I'm excited to discuss the sale of this incredible product with you. I think you'll find it's a game-changer. I'm willing to offer it to you for $1800000. Is this something you'd like to consider?",1800000.0,Alice,1,
,,Bob,1,RejectOffer
"I'm interested in the product, but $1800000 is a bit out of my budget. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1500000?",1500000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"I understand that $1500000 is a bit lower than my initial offer, but I'm willing to be flexible. However, I'm not willing to go as low as $1200000. How about we meet in the middle at $1650000? This is a fair price considering the product's value and the market demand.",1650000.0,Alice,3,
,,Bob,3,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but I'm still not comfortable with $1650000. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1550000?",1550000.0,Bob,4,
,,Alice,4,RejectOffer
"I'm starting to think that $1550000 is a bit closer to the value I was thinking, but I'm still not willing to go that low. I'm willing to make a slight concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1675000? This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value and the market demand.",1675000.0,Alice,5,
,,Bob,5,RejectOffer
"I appreciate your flexibility, but $1675000 is still too high for me. I'm willing to pay up to $1200000, which is the price I've been offered by another seller. Can we meet in the middle at $1550000 was a bit too high, how about $1500000 is too high, I'll go for $1475000?",1475000.0,Bob,6,
,,Alice,6,RejectOffer
"I understand that you're trying to negotiate, but I'm starting to feel that we're getting a bit far from the original value of the product. I'm willing to make one more concession, but I need to make sure I'm getting a fair price. How about we meet in the middle at $1625000? This is a compromise that I think is reasonable considering the product's value and the market demand.",1625000.0,Alice,7,
