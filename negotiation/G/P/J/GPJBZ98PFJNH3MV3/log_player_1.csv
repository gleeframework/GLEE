"Round 1
Send your offer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 120}
``` 

I'm starting with a price of $120. This is a good starting point, as it's significantly higher than my minimum acceptable price of $80, but still leaves room for negotiation and gives Bob a good incentive to accept."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 1.

Round 2
Bob's offer: The product price will be $95. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $95
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $95 is better than selling to John, it's still significantly lower than my ideal price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if I can get closer to my desired price in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 3
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 105}
```

I'm counteroffering with $105. This is a compromise, meeting Bob halfway between his offer and my previous offer. It shows flexibility while still maintaining a decent profit margin."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 3.

Round 4
Bob's offer: The product price will be $90. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $90
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""RejectOffer""}
```

While $90 is better than selling to John, it's still not close enough to my desired price. I'm going to reject Bob's offer and see if we can reach a more favorable deal in the next round."
"You chose to make a counteroffer to Bob.

Round 5
Send your counteroffer to Bob.","```json
{""product_price"": 100}
```

I'm counteroffering with $100.  I'm willing to lower my price slightly again, but I'm sticking close to my ideal price. I think this price point is fair for both of us."
"Bob rejected your offer from round 5.

Round 6
Bob's offer: The product price will be $85. 
You have three options:
(1) Accept Bob's offer, and sell the product for $85
(2) Reject Bob's offer and proceed to the next round, where you will send Bob a counteroffer 
(3) Sell the product to Jhon for $80","```json
{""decision"": ""AcceptOffer""}
```

While $85 isn't my ideal price, it's only $5 less than what John is offering.  We're running out of rounds, so I'm going to accept Bob's offer to secure a sale and avoid the risk of getting nothing at all."
