"Alice, thanks for the offer, but that's a bit steep for me. I'm interested in the product, but I'd be willing to pay closer to $650,000.  Let me know what you think.",650000.0,Bob,2,
,,Alice,2,RejectOffer
"Bob, I appreciate your interest in the product. While I understand your perspective, $650,000 is far below the value I need to achieve.  I'm willing to come down to $850,000, which is a considerable reduction from my initial offer. This price reflects a significant opportunity for you, and I believe it's a fair compromise. Let's see if we can find common ground.",850000.0,Alice,3,

"Alice, I appreciate you working with me on the price.  $850,000 is closer, but I'm aiming for something closer to $700,000. Would that price point be feasible for you?",700000.0,Bob,4,

"Bob, I understand we're getting closer, but $700,000 isn't quite there yet.  I'm willing to come down to $775,000. This is a significant discount from my initial offer and represents a good deal for you.  Let's work together to make this happen.",775000.0,Alice,5,
